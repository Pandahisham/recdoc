Normal and pathologic biochemistry of the lung.

The lung is an important metabolic organ. Glucose provides the major source of substrate. Oxidative pathways are active and are required to maintain normal tissue energy stores. Synthetic activity in the lung is extensive and related mainly to synthesis of dipalmitoyl lecithin and other components of the lung surfactant system. The lung plays an important role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous hormones leading to degradation as well as activation of important biologic properties.
