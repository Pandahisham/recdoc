A De Novo Germline APC Mutation (3927del5) in a Patient with Familial                    Adenomatous Polyposis: Case Report and Literature Review

Characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colonic                        adenomas, classic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is one of the most                        common hereditary syndromes associated with an increased risk of colorectal                        cancer. Several studies have attempted to correlate specific APC mutations                        with clinical phenotype.6 However, there is considerable variability in the expression                        of specific phenotypes within families and among individuals with identical                            mutations.7
A 30 year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department with a                        2-week history of persistent, worsening, left lower quadrant abdominal pain.                        She had no family history of malignancy. Sigmoidoscopy revealed innumerable                        polyps in the rectum and sigmoid colon and a large mass in the sigmoid                        colon. Biopsy of the mass revealed a moderately differentiated                        adenocarcinoma invading the subserosa. Endoscopy revealed innumerable                        polyps. Genetic testing of the patient via southern blot revealed a germline                        APC mutation 3927del5, resulting in a premature truncation of the APC                        protein at amino acid position 1312. 
Genetic information has only recently started being incorporated into                        clinical care. More research and randomized clinical trials need to be                        conducted to definitively characterize random mutations. Once these                        mutations are further understood, FAP patients may be able to be risk                        stratified and this may ultimately improve the screening, diagnosis, and                        treatment of this rare condition.

Characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of colonic adenomas,                classic familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is one of the most common hereditary                syndromes associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. FAP occurs once in                every 10,000–30,000 live births,1 has a relatively equal worldwide distribution,                and occurs equally among males and females. Colon cancer occurs in approximately                ninety percent of affected individuals by age 45. These patients are also at an                increased risk for extra-colonic malignancies, such as duodenal ampullary cancer,                follicular or papillary thyroid cancer, childhood hepatoblastoma, and                medullablastoma.
FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion by germ line mutations in the                adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene located on chromosome 5q21–22.2 More than 800 mutations of the                APC gene associated with FAP have been described and the majority of these mutations                involve frame shifts and premature stop codons, which results in truncated,                non-functional APC gene products.3,4 In most FAP                patients, the expression of the APC mutation involves an inherited mutation of one                APC allele, with a “second hit” deletion of the other allele.5 Several studies have attempted                to correlate specific APC mutations with clinical phenotype.6 However, there is considerable variability in                the expression of specific phenotypes within families and among individuals with                identical mutations.7
We report a case of newly diagnosed FAP in a patient without any family history of                the syndrome or its associated malignancies.
A 30 year-old Hispanic female presented to the emergency department with a 2-week                history of persistent, worsening, left lower quadrant abdominal pain with increasing                constipation. Her past medical history was significant for iron deficiency anemia                and migraines. She was a non-smoker and drank alcohol socially. She had two brothers                and had no children. There were no 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree relatives with a history                of colon cancer or any other malignancies. The patient’s family had frequent                follow-up medical care with adherence to current cancer screening guideline                recommendations. On admission, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.                Physical exam revealed a soft, moderately distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel                sounds and tenderness to palpation over the left lower quadrant. Pertinent                laboratory findings included white blood cell count 12.8 ×                103/μL, hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, hematocrit 29.5%, mean corpuscular                volume 67.7 fL, red blood cell distribution width 17.9, and carcinoembryonic antigen                1.25 ng/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous                contrast revealed innumerable polypoid filling defects within the transverse and                descending colon (Fig. 1).                Sigmoidoscopy revealed innumerable polyps in the rectum and sigmoid colon with a                large mass (5.0 cm by 2.0 cm) in the sigmoid colon (Figs. 2 and 3). Biopsy of the mass revealed a moderately                differentiated adenocarcinoma (Fig.                    4A) invading the subserosa (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemistry staining revealed homogenous                proliferative activity with ki-67 (Fig.                    4C) and variable intensity P53 staining (Fig. 4D). The tumor cells were negative for MSH2                and positive for MLH1, PMS2 and MSH6 by immunohistochemistry. The tumor was                classified as MSI-High, indicating a high probability of microsatellite instability.                Endoscopy revealed innumerable polyps and “coffee ground” blood in                the fundus, body, and cardia of the stomach (Fig. 5). The patient’s hospital course                was complicated by the development of a rapidly growing colonic abscess that was                successfully drained. Genetic testing of the patient via southern blot revealed no                abnormalities. However, subsequent gene sequencing analysis of the exons and                adjacent intrinsic regions of the APC gene revealed a germline APC mutation                3927del5, resulting in a premature truncation of the APC protein at amino acid                position 1312 with the absence of a MYH mutation. A definitive diagnosis of                classical familial adenomatous polyposis was made and the patient underwent a total                proctocolectomy. Post-surgery, there was no evidence of tumor in 57 nodes reviewed.                The patient tolerated the procedure well and plans were made for an ileal-pouch-                anal anastomosis. The patient was also started on celoximib 400 mg twice per day to                prevent both the recurrence of polyps in the ileal pouch and progression of duodenal                adenomas. The patient’s family underwent genetic counseling and although                recommended, they refused genetic testing at the time.
This case highlights many important genetic and clinical questions regarding a very                rare condition. Why did this patient with no family history of cancer present with a                classically autosomal dominant condition? What is the significance of mismatch                repair genes and of this patient’s specific genetic mutation? What are the                genetic conditions that present similarly to classical FAP? What are the recommended                screening procedures and treatments? Can genetic information be further incorporated                into treatment?
Our patient was classified as MSI-High, indicating a high probability of                    microsatellite instability in her mismatch repair genes. These critical growth                    regulatory genes are responsible for correcting the nucleotide base mis-pairings                    that occur during DNA replication.9–12                    Several of these genes exist, including human mutS homolog 1, 2, 3, and 6, and                    human post meiotic segregation 1 and 2. A tumor is classified as MSI-H when at                    least two of these genes are affected by instability.13 The prevalence and incidence of                    microsatellite instability in FAP patients has not been defined. One study                    suggested that microsatellite instability was only detectable in a small                    proportion of FAP adenocarcinomas and that these cases may constitute a distinct                    subgroup among FAP neoplasms.14 The majority of patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal                    cancer (HNPCC), another common hereditary syndrome, have MSI-H tumors, whereas                    only approximately 15 percent of sporadic tumors are MSI-H. In contrast to                    microsatellite-stable CRCs, sporadic tumors with MSI-H tend to occur in the                    proximal colon, have a greater mucinous component, contain lymphocytic                    infiltration, are more frequently poorly differentiated, and are associated with                    longer survival.
Most colon cancers arise when there is an inactivation of the APC gene and the                    regulation of adenoma epithelial renewal is disrupted. The normal APC protein                    prevents the accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear beta-catenin by mediating its                    phosphorylation and degradation. The majority of mutations in the APC gene (both                    germline and somatic) lead to premature truncation of the APC protein and loss                    of its beta-catenin regulatory domains. Loss of functional APC results in the                    nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which activates the transcription factor                        Tcf-4.15–17 It is proposed that                    beta-catenin/Tcf-4 acts as a switch controlling proliferation in the intestinal                    crypt epithelial cells18,19 and the                    activation of this pathway prevents cell differentiation and induces apoptosis                        resistance.20 The                    genetic events occurring after the APC gene mutation are dependent on the                    underlying genetic instability—chromosomal instability, germ line                    mutations in DNA mismatch repair enzymes, and CpG island hyper-methylation                    phenotype [CIMP+].21
The process of gene sequencing has become relatively simple with newer                        technologies.22 The                    process begins by breaking chromosomes into shorter pieces. These fragments,                    differing in length from each other by a single base, are used as templates to                    be identified. The fragments are then separated by gel electrophoresis and the                    final base at the end of each fragment is identified, recreating the original                    sequence of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs for each short piece generated in the first step.                    Automated sequencers analyze the data and the output consists of a four-color                    chromatogram showing peaks that represent each of the four DNA bases. After the                    bases are “read,” computers are used to analyze for errors,                    gene-coding regions, and other characteristics.
It is hypothesized that new germline APC mutations account for approximately one                    third of FAP patients who have no family history of the disease.23 Our patient had a germ                    line APC mutation 3927del5, resulting in premature truncation of the APC protein                    at amino acid position 1312. In a review of 417 FAP cases in the literature, the                    frequency of 3927del5 mutations was 8.9%.24,25 In a study by Hadjisavvas et al, the most                    common APC gene mutation was 2307delA, followed by 1242, and 3927del5.24 Another study noted that                    the 3927del5 mutation was associated with a patient presentation of polyposis,                    but no family history of the disease.26,27
Little is known about the function of specific APC mutations, including 3927del5,                    and why certain mutations occur more frequently than others. However, several                    studies have attempted to correlate specific APC mutations with clinical                    phenotypes (Table 1).                    Mutations between codons 169 to 1578 were generally associated with the classic                    form of FAP.6,7,28 Mutations between codons 1445 and 1578                    were associated with desmoid tumors,29–31 whereas mutations between codons 279 to                    1309 correlated with the development of duodenal polyposis.32
Classical FAP typically develops in the second or third decade of life and                    patients generally seek medical attention because of nonspecific abdominal                    complaints, anemia, or an established family history of FAP. FAP is                    traditionally diagnosed based on the presence of more than 100 adenomatous                    colorectal polyps. Genetic testing is now standard for the diagnosis of                        FAP.33–36
Attenuated FAP (AFAP) is a variant of classical FAP and is characterized by a                    widely variable presentation with fewer colonic adenomas (10 to 100), a lower                    (up to 80 percent) lifetime risk of colon cancer, a more proximal distribution                    of adenomas, and a later age of diagnosis of both colonic polyps (average age of                    40 to 45) and colon cancer (average age of 50).37–39 Consideration of genetic testing for AFAP                    (APC gene) is recommended in patients with more than 10 to 20 cumulative colonic                    adenomas.
Approximately 10 to 30 percent of patients with classical FAP, and 90 percent of                    individuals with attenuated FAP do not have a detectable APC mutation.40 Many of these individuals                    have MUTYH associated polyposis (MAP), an autosomal recessive polyposis syndrome                    caused by biallelic mutations in the MUTYH gene.41 The two most common                        MUTYH gene mutations found in MAP in the Caucasian                    population are Y179C and G396D.40 The clinical spectrum of MAP is variable, ranging from a clinical                    phenotype similar to AFAP42 to one of classic FAP.43,44 A large-scale meta-analysis showed that                    MAP patients demonstrated a 28-fold increase in colon cancer, had a higher                    frequency of right sided tumors, and had a mean age of 45 at diagnosis.45 Extra-colonic features                    associated with MAP include gastroduodenal polyps, duodenal carcinoma, osteomas,                    breast cancer in female carriers, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment                    epithelium, dental cysts, and sebaceous gland tumors.46 MAP patients are also at increased risk                    for extra-intestinal cancers including ovarian, bladder, skin, and breast                        cancer.45,47
Fundic gland polyps of the proximal stomach, present in 30 to 100 percent of FAP                        patients,48,49 are thought to have a                    very low risk of progression to cancer, whereas duodenal polyps, present in 45                    to 90 percent of FAP patients, are usually adenomatous and are more likely to                    progress to cancer. Patients with FAP have an approximately 4 to 12 percent                    lifetime risk of cancer of the duodenum or papilla of Vater. Adenomas in the                    distal small bowel and in the stomach occur in 20 to 40 percent of patients with                    FAP, but have a much lower cancer risk than duodenal adenomas. Cancer has been                    reported to occur in the ileostomy following colectomy.50,51 In a sample of 167 patients who were                    followed for up to 15 years following colectomy, the risk for developing one or                    more adenomas in the ileal pouch was 7, 35, and 75 percent at 5, 10, and 15                    years follow-up, respectively.51 FAP patients are also at an increased risk for developing                    intra-abdominal desmoid tumors and have a lifetime prevalence of 20 percent with                    a peak incidence around 30 years of age.52 These tumors are benign, slowly growing                    fibroblastic neoplasms that tend to recur locally and destroy adjacent vital                    structures.
Screening of the upper gastrointestinal tract with upper endoscopy for gastric                    and duodenal polyps has been recommended, although the benefit has not been                    proven in clinical trials.53–55                    It is recommended that FAP gene carriers or high-risk family members engage in                    screening of the lower gastrointestinal tract with a flexible sigmoidoscopy or                    colonoscopy every 12 months from the age of 10–12 until 35–40                    years old if results are persistently negative. Screening recommendations for                    extra-intestinal lesions in FAP, including hepatoblastoma and thyroid cancer,                    include serum alpha-fetoprotein testing with abdominal palpation (every six                    months until the age of six) and annual palpation of the thyroid,                        respectively.56
Colectomy near the time of initial diagnosis is strongly recommended in patients                    with multiple large adenomas or adenomas with villous histology and/or                    high-grade dysplasia. The preferred operation in classical FAP patients is a                    total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. A subtotal colectomy with                    ongoing surveillance or a total colectomy is reasonable in patients with                    attenuated adenomatous polyposis who have minor rectal involvement. One study                    suggested that the specific APC genotype may be useful in                    predicting which patients would be better suited for ileorectal anastomosis                    versus total proctocolectomy with ileal-pouch-anal anastomosis.57 Various medical therapies                    have been researched as an adjuvant to surgery in order to decrease the overall                    GI tract polyp burden. Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, has been shown                    to reduce the number of colonic polyps (28–44 percent reduction) in                    adults with FAP.58,59 NSAIDs are also being                    used to slow the development of adenomas prior to colectomy and to delay new                    polyp formation in the rectum after subtotal colectomy.60
Genetic information has only recently been incorporated into clinical care. Our case                of a rare genetic condition highlights the importance of understanding sporadic                mutations and how genetic mutations can have widely variable phenotypes. Much more                research and randomized clinical trials need to be conducted with FAP patients in                order to more definitively characterize random mutations. The hope is that one day                it will be possible to risk stratify patients with FAP and improve the screening,                diagnosis, and treatment for this condition.
