The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) is a seven transmembrane G-protein linked             glycoprotein expressed on the thyroid cell surface and which, under the regulation             of TSH, controls the production and secretion of thyroid hormone from the thyroid             gland. This membrane protein is also a major target antigen in the autoimmune             thyroid diseases. In Graves' disease, autoantibodies to the TSHR (TSHR-Abs)             stimulate the TSHR to produce thyroid hormone excessively. In autoimmune thyroid             failure, some patients exhibit TSHR-Abs which block TSH action on the             receptor. There have been many attempts to generate human stimulating             TSHR-mAbs, but to date, only one pathologically relevant human stimulating             TSHR-mAb has been isolated. Most mAbs to the TSHR have been derived from             rodents immunized with TSHR antigen from bacteria or insect cells. These antigens             lacked the native conformation of the TSHR and the resulting mAbs were exclusively             blocking or neutral TSHR-mAbs. However, mAbs raised against intact native              TSHR antigen have included stimulating mAbs. One such stimulating mAb has              demonstrated a number of differences in its regulation of TSHR post-translational              processing. These             differences are likely to be reflective of TSHR-Abs seen in Graves' disease.
