STUDIES ON MEASLES 

 It is shown that monkeys which have recovered from experimental measles are immune to reinfection with the virus of measles irrespective of whether the virus is of homologous or heterologous origin. In this respect experimental measles in the monkey corresponds with measles as observed in human beings, and the result is the same whether the virus is inoculated on the respiratory mucous membrane or is injected intravenously.
