Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) implies fetal hypoxia, resulting in blood flow redistribution and sparing of vital organs(brain, heart). Serum cardiac Troponin-I (cTnI), a well-established marker of myocardial ischaemia, was measured in 40 mothersprior to delivery, the doubly clamped umbilical cords (representing fetal state), and their 20 IUGR and 20 appropriate-forgestational-age (AGA) neonates on day 1 and 4 postpartum. At all time points, no differences in cTnI levels were observed betweenthe AGA and IUGR groups. Strong positive correlations were documented between maternal and fetal/neonatal values (r ≥ .498, P  ≤ .025 in all cases in the AGA and r ≥ .615,  P ≤ .009 in all cases in the IUGR group). These results may indicate (a) normalheart function, due to heart sparing, in the IUGR group (b) potential crossing of the placental barrier by cTnI in both groups.

Cardiac troponin (cTn), an inhibitory protein complex located on theactin filament in all striated muscles, consists of three subunits T, I, and C [1]and coordinates striated muscle contraction in response to voltage changes [2]. cTnI is encoded by specific genes [3], blocks the formation of actin-myosin bridges [4] and since it is not found in skeletal muscles [5, 6], it is considered a highly specific indicator of myocardial injury in adults [4]. However, studies have shown that cTnI is alsosuccessfully used in the diagnosis of myocardial injury in neonates withasphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, and septic or cardiogenic shock [7]. Although the half-life of cTnI is relatively short (90 minutes), its diagnostic time range is unusually wide (ranging from a few hours to 10–14 days after the episode of myocardial injury) as a consequence of intracellular compartmentation [7]. 
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) caused by the chronic malnutrition and hypoxia [8, 9] (consequent to deficient placental transport of nutrients and oxygen  [10], asymmetrical pattern of IUGR) is characterized by blood flow redistribution to vital organs (brain, myocardium, and adrenal glands), while other organs are deprived from sufficient blood flow. This phenomenon called “the brain-sparing effect” is usually accompanied by oligohydramnios [11, 12].
Taking into account the brain-sparing effect, this study was based onthe hypothesis that circulating cTnI levels should not differ between IUGR andappropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) full-term infants. Therefore, we aimed todetermine circulating cTnI levels in IUGR and AGA pregnancies at time-pointscharacteristic for intra-and extrauterine life, and correlate determinedlevels with gestational age, gender, and mode of delivery.
The Ethics Committee of our teaching hospital approved thestudy protocol. All included mothers provided signed informed consent beforerecruitment. Forty parturients giving consecutively birth either to 20 AGA or20 asymmetric IUGR full-term singleton infants with a birth weight below the 3rdcustomized centile were included in the study. The Gestation Related OptimalWeight computer-generated program [13, 14] was used to calculate the customizedcentile for each pregnancy, taking into consideration significant determinantsof birth weight, as maternal height and booking weight, ethnic group, parity,gestational age, and gender [13]. Causes of IUGR were identified in each one of our 20 IUGR cases. Thus, nine mothers were presented with preeclampsia and the remaining 11 were presented with gestational hypertension in addition to other pathologicalconditions, such as iron-deficient anemia (3 cases), gestational diabetesmellitus (2 cases), hypothyroidism (3 cases), extreme obesity (2 cases), andcardiac arrhythmias (1 case). Five of the above 11 women were smoking more than10 cigarettes per day during the whole duration of pregnancy. 
Doppler studies were performed in the IUGR group every10–15 days, starting from the 32nd gestational week. During each Dopplervelocimetry evaluation, three consecutive measurements of the pulsatility index(PI) of the studied vessel were done and the mean value was recorded.Concerning uterine and umbilical arteries [8, 15], mean PI values wereprogressively found to be in the upper physiological limits for thecorresponding gestational age in 13 cases (ranging between the 90th and the 95thpercentiles), while in the remaining seven cases, PI values showed increasedimpedance to flow, being above the 95th percentile for gestational age.Regarding middle cerebral arteries [16], Doppler studies showed resistance to be in the lower physiological limits for gestational age, indicating the initiation of blood flow redistribution process. Nevertheless, amniotic fluid was diminished in all IUGR cases. For the evaluation of the amniotic fluid, the largest fluid column on the vertical plane was assessed and was defined as diminished, if <2 cm. Furthermore, placentalweight was reduced ranging from 255 to 400 g.
In contrast, in the AGA group, mothers were healthy andwere either nonsmokers or had abstained from smoking during pregnancy.Moreover, placentas were normal in appearance and weight.
All neonates had no symptoms of intrauterine infection or stigmata ofgenetic syndromes. One- and five-minute Apgar scores were ≥8 and umbilicalcord pH values were  ≥7.25 in all IUGR cases and AGA controls. The demographic data of participating infantsand their mothers are shown in Table 1. 
Blood was collected at specific time points as follows: (1) from themother (MS) during the first stage of labour, or before receiving anaesthesiain cases of elective caesarean section, (2) from the doubly clamped umbilicalcord (UC), reflecting the fetal state, and (3) from the neonates on postpartumdays 1 (N1) and 4 (N4), which are characteristic for transition andstabilization to extrauterine life, respectively. Blood was collected inpyrogen-free tubes and was immediately centrifuged after clotting. Thesupernatant serum was stored at −80°C until assay. cTnI was determined by a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit [troponin I (human cardiac specific) enzyme immunoassay test kit, catalogue number 1105Z, Diagnostic Automation Inc, Calabasas, Calif, USA]. All specimens were run in duplicate. The detection limit was 0.1 ng/mL. Theintra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 2.8% and 6.7%,respectively. The antibodies used in this assay were highly specific for cTnIand there was no cross-reactivity with cTnT or skeletal troponin-T. 
cTnI was normally distributed; thus, Anova for repeated measures, paired samples t test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and Spearman's or Pearson's correlation coefficient were used as appropriate. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. 
Mean (SD) circulating cTnI levels in AGA andIUGR groups at all time points (MS, UC, N1, and N4) are shown in Figure 1. Forall time points, no statistically significant differences in cTnI levelsbetween IUGR cases and AGA controls were documented. 
In the AGA group, no statisticallysignificant differences in cTnI levels were observed between MS, UC, N1, andN4. MS cTnI levels positively correlatedwith respective levels in UC, N1, and N4 (r = .536, P  = .018, r = .498, P = .025 and r = .730, P < .001, resp.). Additionally, N4 cTnI levels positivelycorrelated with UC and N1 levels (r = .492, P < .032 and r = .665, P = .001). As expected, birth weight positively correlated withgestational age (r = .562, P = .010). 
In the IUGR group, MS cTnI levels were significantly lower compared to respective levels in N1 (P < .012) and N4 (P = .026). Additionally, MS cTnI levels positively correlated with respective levels in UC, N1, and N4 (r = .615, P = .009, r = .847, P < .001 and r = .770, P < .001, resp.). N1 cTnI levels positively correlated with N4ones (r = .856, P < .001). Finally, gestational age positively correlated with birth weight (r = .555, P = .009). 
The effect of gender on cTnI levelswas found to be significant in the IUGR group (see Figure 2). Thus, cTnI levelswere significantly lower in mothers with male offspring than female [regressioncoefficient b:  −0.468, 95% CI: (−0.928/−0.008), P = .047]. Similarly, N1 cTnI levels were significantly lower inmales than females [regression coefficient b:  −0.487, 95% CI: (−0.948/−0.026), P = .04]. Lastly, gestational age and mode of delivery did not affect cTnI levels in both groups. 
Although cTnI has been extensively investigated as a diagnostic andprognostic marker of myocardial damage and outcome in paediatric and adultpopulation [17–19], data concerning neonates are relatively limited. In thisrespect, cTnI was increased in asphyxiated neonates compared to healthy ones,suggesting myocardial injury [1]. In addition, cTnI has been reported to be significantly elevated in the cord blood of critically ill newborns and even higher in nonsurvivors [20], implying that cTnI could serve as a predictor of mortality in this group of newborns. Furthermore, increased levels of cTnI were associated with a lower umbilical artery pH [21], and have been reported in sick preterm neonates with idiopathic respiratory distress [22]. 
Although some investigators claim that cTnI levels are undetectable inhealthy adults and healthy pregnant women [23,24], others have given referenceranges for this substance [25,26]. McDonough et al. [27] suggest that underconditions of myocardial stress, ischaemia without myocyte necrosis may occur,resulting in intracellular degradation of troponin and release of itsfragments, which are detected in the serum. The above explanation may justifythe presence of troponin in the maternal circulation in this study.
On the other hand, it has been reported that healthy term newborns werepresented with higher upper reference limits of circulating cTnI than adults[25,26,28]. No plausible explanation why this happens has yet been reached.Nevertheless, this fact may reflect programmed cell death, since apoptosiscontributes to the neonatal adaptive changes in the heart postpartum [29, 30].Otherwise, this fact could be attributed to different plasmatic eliminations ofcTnI in neonates [31]. In accordance, our study showed that mothers demonstrated lower cTnI levels than their IUGR infants who had oligohydramnios and presumably impaired renal function. 
Araujo et al. [31] published reference values for cTnI in healthy term neonates, ranging between 0.01 ng/mL (2.5th centile) and 2.8 ng/mL (99th centile). The values of cTnI in both groups (IUGR and AGA) of the present studyrange within these limits; therefore, they suggest no evidence of myocardialdamage (according to criteria for definition of myocardial injury [32]) andsupport our hypothesis thatcirculating cTnI levels should not differ between IUGR (below the 3rd customized centile) and AGA full-term infants, due to sparingof basic organs (e.g., brain, heart).  In this respect, a previous study of ours reported thatcirculating levels of neurotrophins, which are important for pre- and postnatalbrain development, did not differ between IUGR and AGA groups [33]. 
According to our results, cTnI seems to cross the placental barrier,since positive correlations between maternal and fetal/neonatal cTnI levelswere documented for both IUGR and AGA groups. No relevant reports for cTnI existin the literature; however, for cTnT experimental evidence suggestsnontransplacental passage [34]. 
Our finding that maternal and neonatal cTnI levels are lower when theIUGR offspring is a male has not been previously reported. Relatively, Baum etal. [28] have demonstrated that male newborns have a significantly highermedian cTnT value than females, while no respective difference was observed intheir study concerning cTnI levels.  On the contrary, other investigators give similar cTnT values for males and females [35]. 
In conclusion, circulating cTnIlevels do not differ between IUGR cases and AGA controls, possibly due to thesparing of vital organs, like the heart. Furthermore, cTnI possibly crosses theplacenta, as strong correlations between maternal and fetal/neonatal values aredocumented. Lastly, maternal and neonatal cTnI levels are lower when the IUGRoffspring is of male gender.
