Sclerosing mesenteritis is a rare, idiopatic, usually benign, inflammatory process of the mesenteric adipose tissue. The most common site of involvement is the small bowel mesentery. We present a case of sclerosing mesenteritis of the rectosigmoid colon as a cause of severe abdominal pain, abdominal obstruction, and ischemic colic mucosal lesions. Contrast enema, colonoscopy, angiography, and CT were the imaging modalities used. A 20 cm diameter, fibrotic mass causing extensive compression of rectosigmoid colon was found at laparotomy. Histological examination showed extended fibrosis, inflammatory cells infiltration, lipophages, and granulomas within the mesenteric adipose tissue associated with erosive colitis. Clinical presentation and treatment are discussed.

Sclerosing mesenteritis  (SM) is a rare, usuallybenign disorder that affects the mesenteric fat tissue. This disease usuallyarises from the mesentery of the small bowel and rarely involves the mesocolon[1, 2]. SM can express microscopically as predominantly fat tissuelesions  (termed mesenteric panniculitis) or as predominantly fibrotic lesions(termed retractile mesenteritis). Clinical presentations and imaging patternsare nonspecific, so only the histopathologic analysis of SM masses provides asound diagnosis. About the prognosis, SM can show both a favorable course anda so much extended fibrotic process that can produce medical or surgicalurgencies. It is likely that a malignancy is associated to SM lesions, so,although medical therapies have been proposed, only surgical complete removalcan solve complications, if present, can prevent unfavorable progress,  and canavoid the risk of hidden metachronous cancers. We report the case of a malepatient with sclerosing mesenteritis complicated by intestinal obstruction. Thediagnosis could be performed only by anatomopathologic findings and SM was treatedby surgical resection. Discussion is focused on aetiology, histology, naturalhistory and treatment.
A 59-year-old man complained oftwo-month history intermittent lower abdominal pain and constipation. About oneyear before, due to dyspeptic symptoms, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy wascarried out showing jatal hernia. His past medical history included only acutemyocardial infarction 13 years before. Laboratory tests were not contributory;tumor markers carcinoembryonicantigen, alpha-fetoprotein, andcarbohydraticantigen 19.9 were negative. Barium enema demonstrated ruggedmucosa and serrated contour with narrowing of the sigmoid colon by a probableextrinsic encasement. Then, a colonoscopy revealed reduction until 14 mm ofcalibre of the sigmoid colon, with rigid walls and aphtosis of the rectum. Histological examination of the endoscopic biopsies diagnosed ischemic colitis. Angiography of the celiac artery and of the mesenteric arteries showed noabnormalities.
Patient's symptoms got worse over the nextmonth, mucous diarrhoea appeared and the patient presented to Emergency Room. On examination, he was afebrile. Physical examination of the abdomen revealedslight abdominal distension and, in the lower abdomen, a firm mass without tenderness,measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter, with mild pain on pressure,corresponding to the sigmoid colon. Rectal examination did not reveal anythingabnormal. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed rare sigmoid divertucula andthickened walls (about 1.5 cm) of the rectosigmoid colon, determining mildluminal narrowing, without signs of perivisceral inflammation; liver wasnormal; there was not lymphadenopathy either ascites. During the third day ofhospitalization, the patient developed obstructive symptoms with abdominalcramping and vomiting. A laparotomy identified a fibrous, partially necrotic,hyperaemic, 20 cm diameter mass in the mesocolon determining stenosis of thesigmoid colon and rectum, adherent to the parietal peritoneum. The mass was resectedin toto with rectosigmoid colon; transanal anastomosis according to Knight-Griffenand temporary protective ileostomy were performed. Postoperative course wasuneventful. Histological examination of surgical specimen revealed lipid-ladenfoamy cells and chronic granulomatous inflammation of mesocolon, associatedwith erosive colitis (Figures 1 and 2); these findings were consistentwith idiopathic sclerosing mesocolitis; aspecific reactive lymphadenopathy ofpericolic nodes (Figure 3).
Three months later, Gastrographin enemaexcluded intestinal fistula, so patient underwent ileostomy surgical closure. At two years follow-up patient is asymptomatic.
Sclerosing mesenteritis (SM) is an uncommonnonneoplastic inflammatory process in the mesenteric fat that rises as apseudotumor, usually involving the small bowel mesentery, the mesenteric fatand, less commonly, the mesentery of the large bowel. Young adults are mainlyaffected, more often men than women; about 2-3:1 [3–6], and theincidence increases above age 50 [3], although also rare cases ofchildren have been reported [7].
Several names are  proposed for thisdisease, as SM, retractile mesenteritis, mesenteric nodular panniculitis,mesenteric Weber-Christian disease of the mesentery, and mesentericlipodystrophy, but they represent histological variants of a single pathologicentity that differs only in its proportion of fibrosis, lipid-ladenmacrophages, adiponecrosis, and nonspecific inflammatory infiltration. Microscopic diagnostic findings are chronic inflammatory process of themesentery, characterized by fibrosis, myofibroblasts, and inflammatory cellsinfiltration, degeneration of the fatty tissue or fat necrosis; aggregations oflipid-laden foamy macrophages are also present and they can be distributed inbands of variable width or in scattered areas [3, 8, 9]. Two patterns ofexpression are known: mesenteric panniculitis (if, at histology, the lesion ischaracterized more by inflammation and fat necrosis than by fibrosis) and retractilemesenteritis (when the lesion is characterized by predominant fibrosis)   [1, 10]. Our patient showed predominant inflammation and fat changes rather thanfibrosis. The lesions are usually single mass; multiple masses or diffusethickening of the mesentery are less common [5, 9]. The present caseinvolved the large bowel mesentery with a single mass.
There is lack of consensus about the etiologyof SM. Several causes have been hypothesized, as ischemia, infections, previoustrauma, autoimmune disorders, previous abdominal surgery, coexistingmalignancies moslty urogenital or gastrointestinal lymphomas [1, 2, 10].
Establishing the diagnosis of SM is both aclinical and histologic challenge. Clinical presentations are nonspecific andin common with numerous other diseases. Patients with SM may present withintestinal obstruction or ischemia, abdominal pain or distension, abdominalmass, weight loss, fatigue, fever of unknown origin, protein-losing enteropathywith diarrea, and minimal change nephropathy [11–14]. SM may betotally asymptomatic, incidentally discovered on CT performed for otherreasons. Some Authors described concomitant SM and bile ducts fibrosissimulating Klatskin's tumor [15], SM involving the pancreas mimickingpancreatic malignancy [6], and SM and inflammatory pseudotumorsimulating gastric lymphoma or linitis plastica [16]. The duration ofsymptoms can range from days to 10 years (average 12 months) [9].
Differential diagnosis take into accountmesenteric lipomas and liposarcoma, but radiographic tools (contrast studiesand CT or MRI [17]), even if veryuseful in the detecting of the mass, can give only a suspicion of thispathologic entity, because they provide nonspecific appearances, so thediagnosis can only be obtained by histology. A pseudoascess resulting from adiverticular diseases could be ruled out because of the absence of complicatedsigmoid diverticula and the absence of septic findings.
SM has three modes of progression: partial orcomplete resolution of the inflammatory process, a nonprogressive course, or anaggressive course, characterized by a progressive fibrosis. That can causeshortening of the mesentery and compression of mesenteric vessels and thenthrombosis with secondary variceal bleeding, ischemia or life-threateningintestinal obstruction or ureteric obstruction with peritonitic or uremicstatus. In our case colonoscopy found ischemic mucosal lesions, probably due tothe compression of terminal colic vessels by the fibrotic process. SM usuallyhas a bening course with a favorable outcome [4, 9] and spontaneousresolution has been reported [6], but there are not identifiedprognostic factors to predict the kind of progression. It has been suggestedthat colonic forms have a more aggressive course and require surgical treatmentmore often than other forms [5].
There is not any specific treatment for SM. Manymedical modalities—including corticosteroids, colchicines,immunosuppressive drugs, and progesterone—have been used with varying degrees of success[8, 11, 18–22]. We think that complete laparotomic surgical resectionis mandatory in presence of complications as obstructions and vascularinvolvement, but surgery has to be attempted also in order to allow a definitediagnosis by the histology and to avoid the risk of coexisting malignancy, thatis hard to rule out in case of endoscopic or laparoscopic biopsies.
