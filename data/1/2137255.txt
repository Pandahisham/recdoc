THE PATHOLOGIC EFFECTS OF INTRAVENOUSLY ADMINISTERED SOLUBLE ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY COMPLEXES 

 The intravenous administration to rats of soluble antigen-antibody complexes in antigen excess resulted in acute glomerulonephritis. This occurred with both rabbit antiovalbumin and rabbit anti-BSA systems. The rats so treated regularly showed proteinuria and elevation of blood urea nitrogen. These findings are compared with those reported in rats injected with anti-kidney serum.
