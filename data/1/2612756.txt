To describe the clinical features of individuals hospitalized for postpartum invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection, a retrospective, population-based study of hospitalized patients in the state of Florida was conducted. Cases of postpartum invasive GAS infection (occurring within 42 days of delivery) were compared to women with other manifestations of invasive GAS disease with respect to their age at the time of admission. Four cases of postpartum invasive GAS infection were detected in this population, yielding a prevalence of 1.6% (4/257) of postpartum disease in this invasive GAS infection database. Patients presented a median of 4 days (mean of 9 days) after delivery with signs and symptoms of infection. Three cases were complicated by bacteremia and one patient had streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Each patient received multiple antibiotics and survived. No patients received intravenous immunoglobulin. For comparison, a secondary retrospective investigation of a large hospital discharge dataset obtained from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration was assessed for patients with puerperal GAS infections. This method yielded an additional three cases, whose clinical and demographic characteristics were summarized. These data highlight that postpartum invasive GAS infection continues to complicate pregnancy, though the frequency has decreased markedly over the past century.

Puerperal  sepsiscauses  at least 75 000 maternal deaths annually, mostly in developingcountries, and the morbidity of puerperal infections affects an estimated 5%–10% of pregnantwomen [1]. At one time, group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS, S. pyogenes) was the major microbialcause of postpartum infection [2]. Indeed, in the late 19th century,Louis Pasteur is credited with discovering that puerperal sepsis waspredominantly caused by streptococci [2]. While today other microbessuch as group B streptococci, gonococci, Chlamydia,herpes simplex, genital Mycoplasma,and bacterial vaginosis are more often implicated in postpartum fever, severecases of puerperal fever are almost always caused by GAS [1]. Worldwide, it is estimated that severe GAS disease (including acute rheumatic fever and invasive infections) isresponsible for over 500 000 deaths annually [3]. 
It has beennoted that the obstetric patient is especially vulnerable to invasive GAS infection acquired via disrupted mucosal or cutaneousbarriers during delivery [4]. Postpartum GAS infections in the modern era are a mixture of illnesses of endogenous (patient)origin and acquired (iatrogenic/nosocomial) infections [4]. Outbreaksof postpartum GAS infectioncontinue to be reported, and are often related to the spread of GAS among postpartum patients by healthcare worksthat are asymptomatic carriers [4].
The Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) conduct population-based, activelaboratory surveillance for invasive GAS disease in the United States [5]. According to the CDC, approximately232 cases of postpartum invasive GAS infection occurred in the United States in 1997, an incidence of 0.06 cases per1000 live births [4]. We previously published an extensiveinvestigation of invasive GAS infections that were reported to the Florida Department of Health between 1996and 2000 [6]. The database used for our original study included 257hospitalized patients, providing a relatively large sample size for exploringpostpartum GAS infection.Therefore, the objective of this study was to report the detailed clinical andepidemiologic features of women hospitalized for postpartum invasive GAS disease in Florida  during the four-year period of 1996–2000.
Previouslyunpublished demographic and clinical data on postpartum invasive GAS disease from a study conducted in Florida, themethods of which are described in detail elsewhere, were accessed [6, 7]. The original study population was comprised of 257 patients who werehospitalized throughout the state of Florida between August 1996 and August2000 for invasive GAS disease andreported to the Florida Department of Health (Tallahassee, Fla, USA). Invasive GAS disease was defined as isolation of group A Streptococcus from a normally sterilesite (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid, joint fluid, pleural fluid, orpericardial fluid) and a clinically compatible presentation. The definition ofa clinically compatible presentation was one of several entities, includingpneumonia, bacteremia in association with cutaneous infection (e.g.,cellulitis, erysipelas, or infection of a surgical or nonsurgical wound), deepsoft-tissue infection (e.g., myositis), meningitis, peritonitis, osteomyelitis,septic arthritis, postpartum sepsis (i.e., puerperal fever), neonatal sepsis,and nonfocal bacteremia. The original study also included cases of necrotizingfasciitis if GAS was isolated froma nonsterile site. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) was defined asreported by the CDC Working Group on Severe Streptococcal Infections [8].
For each case ofinvasive GAS disease that wasreported by a county health department to the Florida Department of Health, athree-page case report form was completed after the review of the patient's medical record [7]. This chart review was usually performed by an epidemiology staff member at thereporting county health department. The surveillance case report form containeda section which required the chart reviewer to check off the diseases caused bygroup A Streptococcus including “endometritis/postpartum sepsis.” [9]. Another section captured information on underlying illnesses and riskfactors including “pregnancy/peripartum” via a check box [9]. Caseswere included in our current analysis if endometritis/postpartum sepsis wasnoted on the surveillance form and/or “pregnancy/peripartum” was checked off inthe risk factor portion of the form and the infection occurred within 42 daysof delivery. Although puerperal infection is most commonly encountered withinthe first 2 weeks after delivery, the definition extends to 42 days postpartum [1]. A cutoff of 42 days was employed to include the conventional duration of thepuerperium, that period between the completion of delivery and the return ofthe reproductive tract to its nonpregnant condition. In addition, postpartum invasiveGAS infections have been reportedto occur up to 6 weeks after delivery [10]. The risk factor sectionincluded various conditions including obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease,chronic heart disease, alcohol abuse, and noncutaneous malignancies. Antimicrobialtherapy that was received during the hospitalization was also noted on thesurveillance form.
Thehealth department surveillance dataset did not contain the patients' lengths ofstay. Length of stay is a recognizedmeasure of disease severity when assessing pregnancy-related morbidity [11]. Lengths of stay were available in alarge Florida hospital discharge dataset that was obtained from the Florida Agency for HealthCare Administration. As an alternative method and comparator to the aboveinvestigation, we retrospectively queried this Florida  hospital discharge dataset. Thispublic-use database includes discharge summaries from all nonfederal Floridahospitals except state tuberculosis and state mental health hospitals [12]. After data are entered into this system, they are subjected to formatting andlogic checks. This dataset contained clinical and demographic information for2, 343, and 330 patients who were hospitalized in a reporting facility anddischarged in calendar year 2001. The principal discharge diagnosis and up tonine secondary discharge diagnoses were coded using the InternationalClassification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Procedures performed during the hospital stay were also coded usingICD-9-CM.
The discharge database was searched forwomen carrying the diagnosis of postpartum invasive GAS disease who were residents of Florida.While there is no ICD-9-CM code for “invasive group A streptococcal infection,”postpartum, or otherwise, these cases can be found by searching for women whoseelectronic discharge record contained both an ICD-9-CM code for “majorpuerperal infection” (670.00, 670.02, and 670.04) and the code for “group Astreptococcal infection” (041.01). Three such cases were found in the dischargedataset, and their clinical and demographic characteristics were summarized. Finally,the 2001 incidence rate of postpartum invasive GAS disease was calculated by dividing the 3 cases by the number of resident livebirths in Florida in 2001 [13].
SAS for Windows 9.1.3 (Cary, NC, USA) was used to manage andanalyze the data. Cases of postpartum invasive GAS infection were compared to women with other manifestations of invasive GAS disease with respect to their age at the timeof admission. Median ages are reported along with a two-sided P-valuefrom a two-sample Wilcoxon test. The small number of postpartum cases (n = 4)prevented a comprehensive statistical analysis. Analyses of all databases were approvedby the Institutional Review Board of the Texas Tech University Health SciencesCenter School of Medicine at El Paso.
Clinical,laboratory, and epidemiologic features of the four cases identified by theFlorida Department of Health are shown in Table 1. According to the publichealth surveillance form, none of the cases had pharyngitis, necrotizingfasciitis, or toxic shock syndrome caused by group A Streptococcus. The median age of the postpartum cases was 27.5 yearswhile the median age of the 116 women hospitalized with other manifestations ofinvasive GAS disease was 54 years(two-sided Wilcoxon P = .04). GAS bacteremia was noted in cases 2 through 4 (Table 1). The hospital mortalityrate was 0%. Of the three cases (cases 2 through 4) whose surveillance formshad known values for the receipt of IVIG, none had received IVIG during thehospital stay (data not shown). Patients presented a median of 4 days (mean of9 days) after delivery with signs and symptoms of infection. One patient metthe case definition of STSS (Case 3 below).
Case 1 was a 36-yearold injecting drug user (Table 1) and had been a smoker in the 6 monthspreceding the current admission (data not shown). She developed peritonitisapproximately 3 weeks postpartum with GAS.The interval between the onset of her symptoms and hospital admission was oneday. The patient was admitted to the hospital from her doctor's office with thesuspected (admitting) diagnosis of “rule out appendicitis.” She did not undergosurgery but was treated with parenteral cefazolin and metronidazole. Herhighest temperature with 48 hours of admission was 103.0° F.
Case 2 was deliveredher baby one day preceding the onset of GAS infection. Her surveillance form indicated the presence of pneumonia and GAS bacteremia secondary to the pulmonary focus ofinfection. She had cough, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea at thetime of (or within 48 hours of) admission. Her nadir blood pressure was 98/48mmHg. The patient received doxycycline, vancomycin, gentamicin, metronidazole,and ampicillin/sulbactam.
Case 3 wasadmitted on the day that she developed symptoms of invasive GAS infection. She was a Hispanic woman admittedwith postpartum endometritis and sepsis. She had undergone a bilateral tuballigation at the time of her delivery, three days prior to her admission. Hercase was complicated by STSS, as evidenced by hypotension requiringvasopressive agents (nadir systolic blood pressure on admission was 76 mmHg); hypoalbuminemia;a macular erythematous rash involving her abdomen and thighs; and elevatedaspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase values on admission(609 U/L and 80 U/L, resp.) [14]. She was treated in an intensive careunit with gentamicin, clindamycin, penicillin, and cefepime and survived.
Case 4 wasadmitted with a diagnosis of postpartum fever two days after her symptomsbegan, though the onset of her infection in relation to her delivery date couldnot be determined. She was diagnosed with “bacteremia” and “endometritis/postpartumsepsis” on the surveillance form and GAS was isolated both from vaginal and blood cultures. Her highest temperaturewithin 48 hours of admission was 101° F. She was treated with tobramycin,clindamycin, and ampicillin. She was discharged on hospital day five with a 10-daycourse of oral amoxicillin-clavulinic acid.
The demographicand clinical features of the three women hospitalized for a postpartum invasiveGAS infection (who were identifiedthrough analysis of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration dischargedatabase) are shown in Table 2. Cases A and B appeared to have GAS bacteremia and sepsis, while cases B and Cappeared to have GAS endometritisor a similar inflammatory disease of the uterus excluding the cervix (ICD-9-CMcode 615.9). This code is used for the following diseases: endometritis, endomyometritis,metritis, myometritis, perimetritis, pyometra, or uterine abscess. All threecases survived and were discharged to their homes. The median length of staywas 3 days. Dividing the frequency of three cases by 205 800 live births yielded an annualincidence of 1.5 per 100 000live births.
The objective ofthis analysis was to describe the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologicfeatures of women hospitalized for postpartum invasive GAS disease, an uncommon phenomenon. Using data from an active surveillance programthat operated in 9 regions of the United States, the CDC calculatedthat 2.2% of all cases of invasive GAS disease are postpartum infections [4]. We report a similar, thoughsomewhat lower prevalence: 1.6% (4/257) of the patients in our invasive GAS infections database were women who hadpostpartum disease.
Wahl et al. recently reported on 475culture-confirmed cases of invasive GAS disease that were identified using a voluntary laboratory surveillance systemin Germany [15]. Nine of these infections (1.9%) were related topregnancy. Five of the cases delivered naturally while the remaining four womenunderwent a cesarean section. A limitation of the current study is that themode of delivery was not recorded on the case report forms.
These four casesemphasize that invasive GAS infections occurring during the puerperium are not always limited to thereproductive tract. One mother in our study (case 1) was an injection drug userwith peritonitis occurring approximately 3 weeks postpartum. Our researchmethods precluded an accurate determination of the timing of injection drugusage with the onset of peritonitis. However, intravenous drug use is awell-described risk factor for invasive GAS infection and GAS peritonitis hasbeen reported in this population [16]. This case highlights theimportance for clinicians to consider GAS infections in febrile or septic postpartum patients with known risk factors forthis disease, such as diabetes, alcohol dependence, or injection drug usage.Another patient in our report (case 2) suffered from pneumonia. Though rare inthe postpartum period, invasive GAS lower respiratory tract infections have been reported [4]. We cannotdetermine the pathogenesis of the pneumonia in our second case, which mighthave occurred as a complication of hematogenous spread from the reproductivetract, autoinoculation of the respiratory tract, or acquisition from anotherperson.
One of thepatients in our case series (case 3) had taken one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorydrugs (NSAIDs) during the seven days prior to the onset of GAS disease. It has been suggested that the use of NSAIDsmight increase the risk of developing GAS necrotizing fasciitis or could facilitate the progression of invasive GAS disease to shock and multiorgan failure [17–19]. However,determining a causal association between NSAID use and infectious diseases hasbeen difficult, particularly with retrospective studies [20, 21]. 
Our health department dataset (Table 1)spanning four years (August 1996–August 2000) capturedone case of postpartum invasive GAS disease per year. To complement these data, we searched a Florida hospital database for womendischarged throughout the state in 2001 whose records contained ICD-9-CM codesindicating the presence of postpartum invasive GAS disease. This is a logical source of supplemental epidemiologic informationgiven the fact that a national study reported that 99% of women with postpartuminvasive GAS disease arehospitalized for their illness [4]. The results from the healthdepartment database and the discharge database complement one another and areconsistent with the epidemiology of postpartum invasive GAS disease. Both databases revealed that the majority of these patients do nothave chronic comorbidities. Furthermore, all seven patients survived (Tables 1and 2). According to CDC surveillance data, the case-fatality rate ofpostpartum invasive GAS disease islower than the case-fatality rate of other invasive GAS infections in females of reproductive age (3.5% versus 9.4%) [4].
Obstetriciansshould be aware of the clinical features of GAS endometritis and/or disseminated infection. A review of 47 cases of intrapartumor postpartum GAS infectioncollected relevant clinical aspects of this disease [10]. The majorityof patients (83%) presented within 7 days of delivery, though a minority,presented almost 8 weeks postpartum. Fever, usually of sudden onset at the timeof presentation (or shortly thereafter), was nearly uniform. For 65% ofpatients, fever was the sole presenting symptom, while for others abdominalpain and/or heavy vaginal bleeding were significant complaints. A minority ofwomen (three of the 47) developed septic shock [10]. It has been notedthat women with postpartum GAS sepsis generally present within the first 24 hours after delivery with fever,hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, hemolysis, and disseminatedintravascular coagulation [22]. Such women can present without evidencefor pelvic infection [23].
The medical management ofinvasive GAS infections is anevolving practice [17]. The CDC recommend high-dose parenteralpenicillin and clindamycin for toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis [24], a recommendation echoed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [25]. The CDC also recommends for patients with severe illness, supportive care in anintensive care unit might be needed and early and aggressive surgery is oftenneeded for necrotizing fasciitis cases to remove damaged tissue and stopdisease spread [24].
The patients in our studywere more often than nottreated with multiple antibiotics. Two postpartum patients received clindamycin,which has been associated with a survival advantage over β-lactam antibiotics in some studies of invasive GAS [6, 26]. The mechanisms conferring apotential treatment advantage for clindamycin are complex (reviewed extensivelyin [14]). Clindamycin suppresses the production of GAS virulence proteins, enhances the phagocytosis of GAS by neutrophils, modifies host inflammatory responses, and is immune to theinoculum (“Eagle”) effect wherein GAS grown to high density or stationary phase exhibit decreased sensitivity topenicillins [17]. Clindamycin use has been advocated in the setting ofSTSS [27] and it is note worthyin this regard that case 3 in this report, who suffered from STSS, receivedclindamycin in combination with other antimicrobials and survived. This casealso underscores the acute and fulminate nature that invasive GAS infections can assume.
The use of newer anti-Grampositive antibiotics such as dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, andtigecycline in the setting of GAS infections remains to be defined [28]. If necrotizing fasciitis issuspected then rapid consultations with infectious disease clinicians andsurgeons are imperative. The use of IVIG has been advocated for invasive GAS infections complicated by STSS (reviewed in [14]).None of our 4 postpartum patients received IVIG and this might reflect the lowprevalence of STSS on clinical presentation.
Postpartum GAS infections can occur as a result of an outbreakon a maternity ward [29]. We did not have evidence that these fourcases were related to an outbreak of invasive GAS infections, although our study was not designed to examine theinterrelationships of cases in terms of chronology and location. The four casesreported here each occurred in a different calendar year, suggesting they werenot part of one outbreak. Cases 1 and 2 resided in separate counties that donot border one another. Cases 3 and 4 were residents of the same county at thetime of their illness; however, they were admitted almost 22 months apartindicating that a cluster in space and time was not present.
Although thisstudy was limited by its retrospective nature, it confirms the uncommonoccurrence of postpartum GAS infections in the modern era of antisepsis and antimicrobials. It alsounderscores the importance of recognizing GAS infection in the postpartum period and instituting antimicrobial therapy earlyin the course of infection to reduce the risk of an adverse outcome.
