Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and mandibular osteomata as markers in familial colorectal cancer.

Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) and multiple mandibular osteomata are markers of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We have assessed their prevalence in non-polyposis familial colorectal neoplasia. Multiple mandibular osteomata were present in 1/29 (3%) patients with familial colorectal neoplasia. CHRPE was present in 11/33 (33%) patients with familial colorectal neoplasia compared with 3/36 (8%) with sporadic disease (P = 0.01) and 4/32 (12.5%) control subjects (P = 0.04). Seven patients with familial colorectal neoplasia had multiple areas of CHRPE compared with one with sporadic disease (P = 0.02) and one control subject (P = 0.02). There was no obvious correlation between calculated familial colorectal cancer risk and the presence of multiple areas of CHRPE. A proportion of patients with familial colorectal cancer have a marker found in FAP and may therefore have a constitutional genetic defect, at least in part responsible for their cancer, making them an interesting group for genetic study. Ophthalmoscopy may contribute to risk assessment in familial colorectal cancer.
