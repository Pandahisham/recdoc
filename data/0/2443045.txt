A 27-year old female patient, born and living in Morocco, suffered from severe variceal bleeding andweight loss. Eventually a diagnosis of gastrict fundus varices was made supposedly resulting from partialobstruction of the splenic vein and collateral blood flow via the short gastric veins. Splenectomy wasproposed. Peroperatively it became apparent that a solitary ecchinococcal cyst in the hilus of the spleenobstructed the blood flow in the splenic vein. The cyst, the spleen, and part of the pancreatic tail wereremoved. After splenectomy bleeding did not recur.
