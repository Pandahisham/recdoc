How should federal policy reflect recent research in the area of intrauterine exposure to environmental hazards?

Present policy neither evaluates nor adequately protects the fetus from the effects of intrauterine exposure to environmental hazards. Some examples are intrauterine lead and methylmercury exposure and intrauterine PCB exposures. A sound policy based on a few basic principles can be developed to protect the fetus from harm from intrauterine exposures.
