In eukaryotic cells the nuclear envelope isolates and protects DNA from                        molecules that could damage its structure or interfere with its processing.                        Moreover, selected protection enzymes and vitamins act as efficient                        guardians against toxic compounds both in the nucleoplasm and in the                        cytosol. The observation that a cytosolic detoxifying and antioxidant enzyme                            i.e. glutathione transferase is accumulated in the                        perinuclear region of the rat hepatocytes suggests that other unrecognized                        modalities of nuclear protection may exist. Here we show evidence for the                        existence of a safeguard enzyme machinery formed by an hyper-crowding of                        cationic enzymes and proteins encompassing the nuclear membrane and promoted                        by electrostatic interactions.
Electron spectroscopic imaging, zeta potential measurements,                        isoelectrofocusing, comet assay and mass spectrometry have been used to                        characterize this surprising structure that is present in the cells of all                        rat tissues examined (liver, kidney, heart, lung and brain), and that                        behaves as a “nuclear shield”. In hepatocytes, this                        hyper-crowding structure is about 300 nm thick, it is mainly formed by                        cationic enzymes and the local concentration of key protection enzymes, such                        as glutathione transferase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase is up to                        seven times higher than in the cytosol. The catalytic activity of these                        enzymes, when packed in the shield, is not modified and their relative                        concentrations vary remarkably in different tissues. Removal of this                        protective shield renders chromosomes more sensitive to damage by oxidative                        stress. Specific nuclear proteins anchored to the outer nuclear envelope are                        likely involved in the shield formation and stabilization.
The characterization of this previously unrecognized nuclear shield in                        different tissues opens a new interesting scenario for physiological and                        protection processes in eukaryotic cells. Selection and accumulation of                        protection enzymes near sensitive targets represents a new safeguard                        modality which deeply differs from the adaptive response which is based on                        expression of specific enzymes.

In eukaryotic cells different types of biologic machineries contribute to protect DNA                from molecules that could damage its structure or interfere with its processing. The                nuclear envelope is a first important mechanical barrier that opposes the                interaction of toxic compounds with the genetic material [1]. A second one is represented by                specific protection enzymes and molecules (i.e. glutathione,                vitamin A, C and E) able to eliminate many dangerous compounds. A third protection                mechanism is formed by specific transcription factors mediated pathways [2]. Among                the many toxic and dangerous compounds for the nucleus, a prominent killer role is                due to compounds that produce oxidative (ROS), nitrosative (RNS) and alkylative                stress. Catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) (scavengers of                    H2O2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (which eliminates                    HO2• radicals) are the most important antioxidant                enzymes that counteract in many cells the killer activity of ROS. Recently an active                antioxidant role has been described for heme oxygenase-2 in specific cell lines                    [3], [4] and for DNA                polimerase iota, an enzyme which has intranuclear localization [5]. Glutathione transferases (GSTs),                a superfamily of enzymes grouped in at least eight gene-independent classes in                mammals, are also involved in the cell protection against alkylating compounds and                organic peroxides. These enzymes catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to                the electrophilic centre of toxic alkylating compounds [6] and the Alpha class isoenzymes                display a selenium-independent glutathione peroxidase activity [6]. We have also demonstrated that                GSTs is involved in the cell defence against excess nitric oxide (NO) sequestering                this free radical in a harmless iron complex bound to the active site [7]. Thus GST                represents a multifunctional enzyme involved in the protection against ROS, RNS as                well as against electrophilic agents. While this enzyme can be up-regulated in case                of electrophilic or ROS stress [8], [9], the intracellular concentrations of CAT and GPX in                various tissues cannot be increased in case of oxidative stress conditions [10], [11]. Despite the                absence of a general adaptive response, a permanent optimization of the defence                power could be reached by increasing the local concentration of protection enzymes                near sensible intracellular targets like the nucleus. Possible existence of this                novel defence strategy is suggested by a few observations: a curious presence of                GSTs near the nucleus has been reported many years ago in immunohistochemical and                non-aqueous cell fractionation studies [12], [13], [14]. More recently, we have                observed a relevant accumulation of Alpha class GSTs near the nuclear membrane of                the rat hepatocytes [15], a phenomenon revealed by the expedient of avoiding                exogenous salts or buffers during the purification of the nuclear fraction [15]. The presence                of salts or buffers, usually employed for nuclear preparations, easily detached                these proteins from the membrane, a finding suggesting a predominant contribution of                electrostatic interactions in this binding [15]. Importantly, the use of a                specific fluorescent probe for GST signalled its perinuclear accumulation even in                intact cells [15].                However, all these previous studies did not verify if other key protection enzymes                beside GSTs are present. The possibility that an unrecognized more complex enzyme                organization near the nucleus may exist is a stimulating proposal worthy to be                investigated.
The present study explores the following possibilities: a) that beside GSTs,                additional protection enzymes may be associated to the nuclear envelope, b) that                this phenomenon may not be restricted to hepatocytes, c) that it has a specific                protection function. We demonstrate here for the first time that a surprising                selected multi-enzyme machinery is present near the nuclear envelope of cells from                many tissues forming a sort of enzyme task-force which contributes to DNA                protection.
In a first experimental approach, nuclei were purified in the absence of                    exogenous salts, and the proteins bound electrostatically to the nuclear                    membrane were detached by increasing the ionic strength (see Materials and Methods). Specifically, in rat                    liver 2.7 mg of nuclear bound proteins per gram of fresh tissue were extracted                        (Table 1), including,                    as expected, the Alpha class GSTs (see below). This amount represents about                    3% of all cytosolic proteins. Nitrogen electron spectroscopic imaging                    (ESI) of nuclei purified in the absence of exogenous salts confirmed the                    presence of a thick protein structure surrounding the nuclear membrane, which                    appears like a “nuclear shield” and almost vanishes upon mild salt                    treatment (Figure 1, A and                    B). Statistical examination of ESI images at varying cut sections is                    consistent with an estimated thickness of the shield of about 300±70 nm.                    Given that the nuclear membrane available is 0.022 m2/g of liver                        [15],                        [16] (see                        Materials and Methods), the shield                    region has a protein density of about 0.4 g/cm3, a value twice as                    high as the one in the cytosolic milieu (∼0.2 g/cm3), but only                    half as much as the one in a protein crystal (∼1 g/cm3) [17]. In other                    words, this structure, rather than a compact multilayer [15], may be represented as a                    region of perinuclear hyper-crowding which is undetectable by means of standard                    morphological microscopy (Figure                        1C).

Zeta potential, a sensitive function of the interface nature of suspended                    particles [18], [19], added further details on the protein organization of                    the shield. At increasing ionic strength, the change in zeta potential of                    isolated nuclear fractions parallels the GST detachment and proceeds without                    apparent discontinuity (Figure                        2A), supporting the view that the different proteins forming the                    shield are mixed homogeneously. The zeta potential perturbation observed at very                    low ionic strength is likely due to a nuclear disaggregation process as                    suggested by the light scattering analysis (Figure 2B). We observed that a spontaneous                    and partial change of the zeta potential, accompanied by a parallel detachment                    of about 50% of the shield proteins, occurs even without addition of                    salts by simply incubating a dilute nuclear fraction in 0.25 M sucrose (Figure 2C). On the other hand,                    de-shielded nuclei extensively washed with 0.25 M sucrose are still able to                    re-constitute about 50% of the original nuclear shield when incubated                    with a cytosolic fraction. The process is fast but not instantaneous showing a                        t1/2 of 2.5 minutes (Figure 2D). The observed time dependent and                    spontaneous detachment of the nuclear shield (up to 50%) in 0.25 M                    sucrose suggests that the shield, as it appears immediately after nuclei                    preparation, could not be an artefact due to the use of sucrose. Obviously, the                    possibility that positively charged proteins present in the cytosol may be                    linked to a negative counterpart (i.e. proteins or phospholipid                    layers) depends on the relative competition between the cationic proteins and                    other positively charged ions (mainly K+). Thus, the relative                    concentration of these cationic objects drives protein attachment or detachment.                    The modality employed to prepare the nuclear fraction in 0.25 M sucrose does not                    perturb the reciprocal concentration of all cationic competitors and thus it                    appears a correct procedure to visualize specific electrostatic interactions                    like those which promote the nuclear shield. In addition, the existence of an                    artefact should be signalled by an increase in the shield when the relative                    amount of sucrose (compared to the cytosolic volume) is increased. Conversely,                    protein content of the nuclear shield remained almost unchanged when the nuclei                    were prepared from liver homogenate under different dilution conditions                        (i.e. 1∶3, 1∶6, 1∶10 and 1∶20 gram                    of tissue/ml of 0.25 M sucrose) (data not shown). Other previous evidences                    confirm the real existence of the shield; the perinuclear accumulation of GST                    has been demonstrated in intact cells (thus without sucrose) by using a specific                    fluorescent probe for this enzyme [15] and a similar evidence has                    been obtained using immunostaining procedures [12], [13], [14].
Shielded nuclei were diluted with 20 volumes of 0.25 M sucrose. (A) Zeta                            potential changes (pink squares) and GST detachment                                (green squares) due to the addition of potassium                            phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Zeta potential perturbation at very low buffer                            concentration (below 1 mM) is due to a nuclear disaggregation process as                            suggested in (B) by a similar perturbation of light scattering at 600 nm                                (pink triangles). (C) Time dependent zeta potential                            changes and nuclear shield GST detachment in 0.25 M sucrose. Shielded                            nuclei suspended in 0.25 M sucrose were incubated at 25°C. At                            variable times the amount of GST released in solution (blue                                circles) and zeta potential (light blue                                circles) were measured. (D) Kinetic of shield re-formation.                            De-shielded nuclei in 0.25 M sucrose were divided into aliquots; each                            aliquot was resuspended in rat liver cytosolic fraction and incubated at                            25°C. At fixed times, the mixture was centrifuged. The re-formation                            of the shield was measured either on the basis of protein content that                            can be detached with 50 mM NaCl. All experiments were performed in                            triplicate. Error bars, s.d.
We next examined whether the protein composition of the nuclear shield is similar                    to the one of the cytosolic fraction or rather only selected proteins are                    enriched in this perinuclear region. Isoelectric focusing experiments first                    suggested that this structure is formed prevalently by positively charged                    proteins (80%) while, in agreement with previous observations [20], the cytosol                    is populated predominantly by acidic proteins (60%) (Figure 3, A–C). Furthermore, a more                    stringent analysis of the basic region of the chromatograms indicated that the                    cationic proteins of the shield, grouped in discrete pI ranges,                    display a different distribution when compared to the cytosolic pool with an                    evident selection of the proteins with higher pI values                        (pI>8.0) (Figure 3D). The average pI of all shield proteins                    is ∼8.0 while the average pI of the cytosol is ∼6.0, a                    value close to that reported in previous studies (pI∼5.5)                        [21].

The double slash shows the connection zone of the two                            chromatograms. Blue area indicates the basic proteins and red area the                            acidic proteins.

(C) Acid-base properties of                            nuclear shield and cytosolic proteins. (D) Percent of acidic and basic                            proteins grouped in discrete pI ranges as derived by                            the experiments shown in A and B.
The identification of specific enzyme activities in the nuclear shield could be                    diagnostic to clarify the physiological role of this structure. Beside the Alpha                    class GSTs – a well known efficient barrier against alkylating compounds,                    organic peroxides and nitric oxide [15], [22] – we detected                    significant amounts of additional anti-oxidant enzymes such as CAT and GPX                        (Table 2 and Figure 4A). In the nuclear                    shield all these enzymes have specific activities (U/mg of total proteins)                    similar and even higher than those found in the cytosol (five times higher for                    GST and three times for CAT) (Figure 4B) and increased local concentrations (seven times higher                    for GST and four times for CAT) (Figure 4C). The normalization of the activities of these enzymes to                    the corresponding nuclear membrane area is an additional parameter here termed                    “defence potentiality” of the shield (Table 2 and Figure 4D). For comparison, we examined the                    presence, in the nuclear shield, of enzymes that do not have a specific                    “protective role”, such as L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), L-alanine                    amino transferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK); these proteins are scarcely                    present in the shield and display very much lower specific activities than in                    the cytosol (Figure 4B).                    Curiously, the CAT identified in the shield is a peculiar cationic form                        (pI = 7.7) that is not found in the                    cytosol where a few anionic forms                    (pI = 5.8÷6.2), also present in                    large amounts in peroxisomes, are the predominant isoenzymes [23]. CAT is                    encoded by a single gene and its theoretical pI value,                    calculated on the basis of the amino acid composition, is 7.5 (see Materials and Methods) close to the one of                    the isoenzyme found in the shield, while the acidic cytoplasmic form is the                    result of post-translational modifications [24]. The shield contains only                    traces of an additional anti-oxidant enzyme i.e. SOD but its                    presence in this region could be pleonastic due to its cytosolic and                    nucleoplasmic localization [25]. Notably, the catalytic activities of GST, CAT and                    GPX are very similar when these enzymes are packed into the nuclear shield or                    free in solution (Figure                    4E), demonstrating that active site accessibility and functional                    flexibility are not impaired by the increased protein density. Mass spectrometry                    analysis of the nuclear shield extract and of the cytosol disclosed additional                    details. Beside a clear confirmation of the prominent selection of cationic                    proteins in the shield (Figure S1, A and B), this approach indicated                    that, in addition to GST, CAT and GPX, many other enzymes contribute to the                    nuclear shield. Keeping in mind that mass spectrometry analysis allows to                    identify only proteins that display proper fragmentation patterns and volatility                    properties (e.g. GPX, whose activity was unambiguously                    identified, could not be detected either in the shield or in the cytosol), 78                    distinct proteins have been identified in the shield, 39 of which are almost                    exclusive of this structure (Table S1 and S2). Of                    note, 72% of the shield proteins have, in their native oligomeric                    structures, molecular masses higher than the cut-off of the nuclear pores                    (kDa = 40÷45) [26], [27], indicating that they are                    unlikely to represent a contamination due to nuclear proteins (Table S2                    and Figure                        S1C). Beside the postulated antioxidant role inferred from the                    observed enrichment of GST, CAT, and GPX, the nuclear shield may also have                    additional functions as hinted from the variegated enzyme mesh identified by                    mass spectrometry approach. In this respect it is worth pointing out that                    typical “metabolic enzymes” such as malate dehydrogenase and                    glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, identified in the nuclear shield, have                    been shown to be also part of transcriptional complexes and implicated in                    transcription regulation [28], [29].
Activity values reported in (A–E) are the means of 5 independent                            tissue preparations. Calculations in (A and C) were made assuming as                            reference the activity of the cytosolic Alpha GST found in distinct rat                            tissues (see Materials and                            Methods).

A cytosol volume of 2630 µm3 for each                            hepatocyte and a shield volume of 67 µm3 (0.3                            µm×222 µm2) were assumed for calculations                                [53]. Errors, s.d. (D) “Defense                            potentiality” of the nuclear shield. GST, CAT, and GPX activities                            found in the nuclear shield and normalized for nuclear membrane area                                (U/m2 of membrane area) of liver, kidney, heart, lung,                            and brain (from Table                                2) were compared to those of liver taken as 100%.                            Error bars, s.d. (E) Catalytic activity of GST, CAT and GPX measured                            when they are free in solution (100%) or packed in the nuclear                            shield (see Materials and Methods);                            error bars, s.d.
Activities of GST, CAT and GPX were measured as reported in Materials and Methods. Values                                reported are the means of 5 independent tissue preparations. The                                standard deviation of the five different replicas are reported for                                each measurement. The units of the cytosolic GSTs (first column) are                                the sum of the activity contributions of all enzyme isoforms.
*“Defense potentiality” is defined as the amount of                                enzyme unit normalized per membrane area.
**Units of cytosolic Alpha class GST were calculated from                                previous studies (see Materials and                                    Methods).
GST units in the shield of various tissues were tentatively ascribed                                to Alpha class GST as occurs for the liver [15].
Whatever possible additional roles played by such a variegated enzymatic                    composition of the shield, the clear enrichment of DNA-protective enzymes (Figure 4C) suggests for this                    newly identified structure a role as a guardian of genomic integrity. Comet                    assay, allowing the assessment of DNA breaks, performed on shielded and                    de-shielded nuclei, showed a direct evidence that the nuclear shield represents                    an efficient protection barrier for the genetic material, both in the presence                    and in the absence of oxidizing compounds (Figure 5A). A quantification of the damage                    produced by H2O2 on DNA has been obtained by measuring the                    tail length (Figure 5B).                    Furthermore, a clear indication that perinuclear Alpha GSTs may act as an                    efficient trap even against non-oxidizing toxic compounds like nitric oxide                    derivatives has been described previously in intact hepatocytes treated with NO                    donors [7].

This protein structure is not restricted to the liver cells but it is also                    present in the perinuclear regions of cells of tissues as diverse as kidney,                    heart, lung and brain (Table                        1, Table 2 and                        Figure 4A). The most and                    the less populated nuclear shields were found in the lung and in the brain,                    respectively (Table 1).                    This difference might be related to the fact that lung cells are more exposed to                    exogenous toxic compounds and, conversely, the brain is a protected tissue by                    virtue of the hematoencephalic barrier. Interestingly, each tissue shows                    different and characteristic levels of antioxidant enzymes in the shield; for                    example, while the liver shield has a relevant amount of CAT and little GPX, the                    opposite it is true in the kidney, lung and brain (Figure 4A).
Only the nuclear membrane displays propensity to form the protein shield.                    Membranes of different intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria,                    microsomes and lysosomes, lack this enzymatic protection [15]. Given that all                    intracellular membranes have similar, albeit non identical, lipid composition,                    it is unlikely that subtle differences may be responsible for the unique                    presence of the shield on the nuclear membrane. We speculate that some                    negatively charged proteins, exclusively present in the nuclear membrane and                    firmly bound to the envelope, may provide the necessary electrostatic potential                    to attract and stabilize the protein shield. Proteolytic experiments support                    this hypothesis; incubation of de-shielded nuclei with trypsin or protease K                    completely inhibits the re-formation of the nuclear shield (Figure 6A).

(B) Tentative pictorial                            representation of nuclear shield on the outer nuclear membrane, also                            based on the models shown in refs. [32], [33]. Proportions between                            anionic and cationic proteins in the shield and in the cytosol shown in                            the picture are those obtained experimentally.
For the first time a particular enzyme-network is identified which is                electrostatically associated to the outer nuclear membrane. In the last years many                studies have been performed to detail composition and role of the inner and outer                nuclear envelopes and their enzymatic equipments. For example, nuclear pores and                other integral membrane protein complexes (belonging to the inner membrane) have                been found to play a fundamental role in the dynamic organization of the genome,                positioning in DNA repair, recombination and stability [30]. On the other hand, recent                findings point to important structural roles for nesprins and plectins, giant                rod-like proteins anchored exclusively to the outer nuclear membrane [31]. These                proteins stretch out into the cytosol and are involved in the nucleus positioning.                The nuclear shield described in the present study implements the functions                correlated to the outer nuclear membrane. The existence in different rat cells of a                perinuclear multi-enzyme structure mainly formed by selected cationic proteins                including key protection enzymes (Figure 3 and Table                    2) indicates that this particular region may act as guard against                oxidative damage. This peculiar finality can be only revealed on the basis of                classical biochemical studies instead of immunocytochemical assays that cannot                verify the enzymatic competence of the detected enzymes. Indeed, antibody works made                in the past [12],                    [13], [14] clearly                indicated the accumulation of GST in the perinuclear region but they were unable to                assess any biological activity. The presence of active forms of GST, CAT and GPX, as                determined in this paper, designs this perinuclear region a sort of hyper-filter                where the detoxifying power is enhanced up to seven times with respect to the                cytosol (Figure 4C). A simple                comet assay visualizes an increased DNA protection against ROS favoured by this                structure (Figure 5). Additional                evidences point to a specific finality of the shield and not to a casual enzyme                assemblage. For example, this structure appears more prominent in tissues more                exposed to toxic compounds (lung) while it is less populated in the highly protected                brain (Table 1). Furthermore,                in tissues where CAT is abundant, GPX (which has similar detoxifying activity                against H2O2) must be redundant and, accordingly, it is                scarcely represented in the shield (Table 2). Obviously, the protection role may be just one of many other                possible functions inherent in this structure. Beside CAT, GST and GPX, the large                variety of different enzymes that composes the shield (Table S2)                represents an unexplored mine for future investigations in this direction. We also                note that most of the shield enzymes have molecular masses higher than the one                allowing the entrance into the nucleus (Figure S1C) and thus this machinery may be a                clever system to approach these enzymes to the chromosomes.
The biochemical and physical characterization of this novel cellular structure                outlines a new level of cell organization, mediated by weak, relatively unspecific,                electrostatic interactions, that somewhat contrasts a picture of the cell delineated                by well organized organelles interspersed in a relatively homogeneous milieu. The                particular protein density of the shield (only two times higher than in the cytosol)                as calculated through ESI measurements, allows to assimilate this structure to an                hyper-crowding which cannot be detected by classical microscopy (Figure 1C). This may explain why                its presence remained masked until now. Interestingly, the lack of shield                re-formation after proteolytic treatment of the nucleus (Figure 2D) indicated that some negatively charged                proteins (specifically present on the outer nuclear envelope) could play a crucial                role in the shield formation. Only a few membrane proteins may be indicated as                possible shield scaffold. Among them, nesprin-1, nesprin-2 and plectin are giant                proteins (ranging from 2800 to 6900 residues) showing rod-like structures about                300–400 nm long [31] (a length similar to the shield thickness), and                exclusively present as a sort of negatively charged network on the outer nuclear                membrane surface [32],                    [33]. These                proteins are involved in the nucleus positioning and display conspicuous net                negative charge i.e. about −70 for plectin, −100 for                nesprin-1 and −240 for nesprin-2 (see Materials                    and Methods) that may represent a good electrostatic counterpart for the                positively charged proteins of the nuclear shield. A tentative pictorial model of                this structure is shown in Figure                    6B.
If the nuclear shield is a functionally important structure, as proposed here,                genetic alterations that reduce its thickness or modify its enzyme composition                should affect the protective role and possibly result in pathological phenotypes.                Intriguingly, many neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer, Parkinson,                Huntington and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are characterized by typical                aggregations of misfolded or damaged proteins in the perinuclear region termed                aggresomes [34].                The possibility that such structures alter the protective nuclear shield described                in this study is just one of the hypotheses that must be verified in the immediate                future.
All reagents used in this study were from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, USA) and                    used without further purification. Trypsin and Protease K (Sigma-Aldrich)                    employed in the proteolytic experiments were from bovine pancreas (11,400 U/mg)                    and from Tritirachium album (13.1 U/mg), respectively.
Male Wistar rats were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbital                    (50 mg/kg body weight, injected i.p.) before rapid killing by                    cervical dislocation minimizing sufferings and subsequent liver, kidney, heart,                    lung and brain dissections. Experiments were carried out with the approval by                    the Ethic Committee of the University of Roma Tre in accordance to the ethical                    guidelines for animal research of the Italian Ministry of Health (permit number:                    246/H10) D.Lvo 116/92.
After perfusion with 0.25 M sucrose and heparine to remove blood, different                    tissues (liver, kidney, heart, lung and brain) from male rats were excised,                    minced and homogenized in a teflonglass Potter Elvehjem homogenizer, in 0.25 M                    sucrose (10 ml per gram of tissue). After a brief centrifugation at                        300×g (3 min) to remove unbroken cells and                    periplasmic membranes, the homogenate was centrifuged at                        1000×g for 10 min to isolate the nuclear fraction                        [15]. The                    resulting supernatant, centrifuged at 100,000×g for 30                    min, represents the “cytosolic extract”. The nuclear pellet was                    washed three times with 10 ml of 0.25 M sucrose and re-suspended in 10 ml of                    0.25 M sucrose. This suspension represents the “shielded” nuclei                    fraction. It contains less than 2% of contaminating structures as judged                    by microscopy analysis. Even less contamination was observed by measuring marker                    enzymes of cytosolic, mitochondrial, lysosomal and microsomal origin [15].                    De-shielded nuclei were obtained by incubating the shielded nuclei (coming from                    1 gram of fresh tissue) with 50 mM NaCl (or 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH                    7.4). After centrifugation at 10,000×g for 5 min,                    4°C, the pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of 0.25 M sucrose. The total                    protein content of cytosolic fraction and nuclear shield fraction were                    determined by the method of Lowry [35].
Nuclear membrane area of cell from different rat tissues were calculated on the                    basis of the total phospholipidic content. Phospholipids were determined                    according to literature protocols [36], [37], [38]. The extraction step started                    from 800 µl of a nuclear suspension of different tissues prepared as above                    described. In a glass tube 4 ml of a solution CHCl3/MeOH 2∶1                    v/v were mixed with the nuclear sample, vortexed for one min and centrifuged at                    2,000 rpm for 2 minutes. The aqueous phase was discarded. Chromatographic                    controls were made by using a TLC slice of silica-gel POLYGRAM SIL UV 254 (0.25                    mm gel with fluorescence probe), eluted with a solution                        CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH3 - 25% 65/30/4/2                    v/v. The organic phase was mixed with 1 ml of NaCl 0.9% at 0°C,                    vortexed and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 minutes. The washing aqueous phase                    was discarded and the organic phase was stored at −20°C. To quantify                    the phospholipidic content, 80 µl of organic phase were evaporated                    (110°C, 15 min), then 70 µl of                        H2SO4/HClO4 1∶1 v/v were added and                    the sample was heated at 240°C for 30 minutes. 1.6 ml of ascorbic                    acid/ammonium molibdate 0.83%/0.2% were added, vortexed and                    incubated at 45°C for 30 minutes. The blue color due to the complex formed                    was quantified spectrophotometrically at 820 nm. The calibration curve derived                    from a standard solution of 1 mM KH2PO4.
For quantitative analysis, the total membrane surface area of a single rat liver                    hepatocyte is assumed 110,000 µm2                    [16].                    Considering that 1 gram of fresh liver contains about 108 cells and                    that the outer nuclear membrane is 0.2% of the total hepatocyte                    membranes, it results that the available outer nuclear surface area is about                    0.022 m2 per gram of fresh liver. The membrane area/g of tissue for                    kidney, lung, heart, and brain was determined by evaluating the phospholipidic                    content as reported above and by comparing this value with the phospholipidic                    content found in rat liver.
Shielded and de-shielded nuclei from rat hepatocytes suspended in 0.25 M sucrose                    were treated with a fixative solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde for                    six hours. Nuclei were post-fixed for 2 hours in 1% osmium tetroxide in                    the same buffer, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in epon 812 resin [39] (TAAB,                    England). Thin and ultra-thin (<40 nm) unstained sections were collected in                    uncoated 200 mesh copper grids and observed with a Zeiss CEM transmission                    electron microscope at 80 kV. Staining of the ultra-thin sections with lead                    citrate and uranyl acetate (usually performed to visualize better sub-cellular                    structures in transmission electron microscopy) was omitted to avoid the                    interference with the ESI and electron energy loss spectroscopy analyses. For                    the localization of N in the specimens, the electron spectroscopic images were                    taken at ΔE = 410 eV, just above the ionization edge                    (IE) of N (Nk ΔE = 401 eV), to detect the total N                    signal, and at ΔE = 377 eV, the pre-ionization edge                    (PIE) of N, as a reference carrying information on the background [39], [40]. The unit                    test area was circular with a variable diameter ranging from 1.3 to 8 mm, which                    was anyway smaller than the selected microscopic field and inversely                    proportional to the degree of microscopic magnification. Net N images were                    obtained by using a digital image analyzer with an interactive built analysis                    system: the N map obtained by subtracting the PIE from the IE images was                    recorded with a highly sensitive camera.
GST, CAT, GPX, and SOD activities were assayed both in cytosolic and nuclear                    shield fractions following usual assay conditions [15], [41], [42], [43]. Cytosolic and nuclear                    shield fractions were treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) to preserve GPX                    enzymatic activity [42]. Enzymatic assays for CK, LDH, and ALT were carried                    out on a Modular P800 device (Roche) [44]. The enzymatic units of                    cytosolic GSTs are the sum of the activities of all enzyme isoforms. Conversely,                    as demonstrated previously for the liver nuclei [15], the activities of GSTs                    found in the shield of the different rat tissues can be related mainly to the                    Alpha class GSTs. The cytosolic Alpha GST abundances are calculated on the basis                    of previous studies on liver [45], kidney [46], heart [47], lung                        [48],                    and brain [49] GSTs.
Comparison of the catalytic activities of GST, CAT and GPX bound to the nuclear                    shield or free in solution was made on shielded nuclei aliquots (suspended in                    0.25 M sucrose), in the absence or in the presence of 50 mM NaCl. Activities                    were measured by usual spectrophotometric methods [15], [41], [42] but in the absence of                    any buffer.
Zeta potential values were obtained by using a Laser-Doppler microelectrophoresis                    using a Zetasizer 5000 instrument (Malvern, UK). Measurement cell was aligned                    before analysis by using reference latex beads (−50±5 mV) (Malvern,                    UK). Zeta potentials were calculated by the integrated Malvern proprietary                    software (v. 1.36) by using the Smoluchowsky model                    (F(ka) = 1.5). Reported values refer to the average of five                    independent measurements (variation coefficient ca. 5–10%).                    Shielded nuclei samples from rat liver in 0.25 M sucrose, kept constantly at                    4°C, were treated with variable amounts of 0.1 M potassium-phosphate buffer,                    pH 7.4 (or of 1 M NaCl). The volume of the added buffer did not exceed                    2.5% v/v. Samples were then poured into the measurement cell and measured                    after temperature equilibration at 25°C (about 1 minute). Preliminary                    experiments have shown that nuclei do not sediment significantly in such time                    interval.
Experiment is illustrated in Scheme S1 (Supporting information). Nuclei                    from rat liver were de-shielded with 50 mM NaCl and washed three times with 0.25                    M sucrose. The nuclear suspension was divided into aliquots, each aliquot was                    resuspended in rat liver cytosolic fraction and incubated at 25°C. At fixed                    times, the mixture was centrifuged. The re-formation of the shield was measured                    either on the basis of protein detached from the nuclei with 50 mM NaCl or,                    alternatively, by measuring the decrease of the total protein concentration of                    the cytosol after incubation with the de-shielded nuclei. Experiments were                    performed in triplicate.
Isoelectrofocusing experiments were performed on an AKTA Purifier system                    (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), equipped with a pump system (P-900), spectroscopy                    unit (UV-900), pH-meter/conductimeter (pH/C-900), and a fraction collector                    (Frac-900). The chromatography runs were performed on a Mono P 5/200 GL (HR                    5/20) column (Amersham Biosciences Inc.), with 1 ml/min flow rate. The pH range                    explored in two different chromatographic runs were from 9.0 to 6.0 using a                    start buffer ethanolamine-CH3COOH 0.025 M pH 9.4 and a Polybuffer                        96-CH3COOH pH 6.0 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and from 7.0 to                    4.0 by a start buffer bis/Tris-Iminodiacetic acid 0.025 M pH 7.4 and a                    Polybuffer 74-Iminodiacetic acid pH 4.0 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Rat                    hepatocyte cytosol extract and nuclear shield extract were loaded at a                    concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. The final chromatograms were recorded and analyzed                    by the software Unicorn 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).
Theoretical pI estimation and electrostatic calculations were                    performed at pH 7.0 by the Protein Calculator Server v. 3.3 at www.scripps.edu. Catalase pI estimation                    (accession number: AAB42378). Proteins selected for net charge calculations:                    plectin (accession number: CAA42169), nesprin-1 (accession number: AAL47053) and                    nesprin-2 (accession number: XP_001080795).
Proteins derived from rat liver cytosolic fraction and nuclear shield fraction                    were precipitated with 50% ethanol, 25% methanol, 25%                    acetone and dissolved in 6 M urea and 100 mM Tris pH 7.9. After reduction with                    10 mM DTT and alkylation with 20 mM iodacetamide, protein samples were digested                    50∶1 (w/w) with sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at                    37°C overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding a final concentration of                    0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were diluted with 0.1% formic                    acid, 3% acetonitrile in water at a concentration of 0.36                    µg/µl, and 0.72 µg of protein digestion were loaded on column                    for peptide separation. Peptides were trapped on a 5 µm Symmetry C18                    trapping column 180 µm×20 mm (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) and                    separated using a 175 min reversed phase gradient at 250 nl/min (3 to 40%                    acetonitrile in water over 125 min) on a nanoACQUITY UPLC™ System                    (Waters), utilizing a 1.7 µm BEH 130 C18 NanoEase™ 75                    µm×25 cm nanoscale LC column (Waters). The lock mass                    ([Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B/µl, 500 fmol/µl) was delivered                    from the auxiliary pump of the with a constant flow rate of 200 nl/min. The                    separated peptides were mass analyzed by a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal                    acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof Premier™, Waters                    Corp.) directly coupled to the chromatographic system and programmed to step                    between low (4 eV) and high (15–40 eV) collision energies on the gas cell,                    using a scan time of 1.5 per function over 50–1990 m/z (Expression mode:                    data independent parallel parent and fragment ion analysis [50]). Continuum LC-MS data                    from three replicates experiments for both rat liver fractions were processed                    using the software ProteinLynx Global Server v2.3 (Waters). Protein                    identifications were obtained with the embedded ion accounting algorithm of the                    software [51] and                    searching on the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein knowledgebase (release 57.15 of                    02-March-10 containing 515203 sequence entries, with taxonomical restriction:                        Rattus norvegicus, 7483 sequence entries). The search                    parameters were: automatic tolerance for precursor ions and for product ions,                    minimum 3 fragment ions matched per peptide, minimum 7 fragment ions matched per                    protein, minimum 2 peptides matched per protein, 1 missed cleavage,                    carbamydomethylation of cysteine as fixed modification and oxidation of                    methionine as variable modification.
Rat liver nuclei suspension in 0.25 M sucrose and the corresponding de-shielded                    nuclei were treated with H2O2 (10 µM) for three                    minutes. The assay was performed starting with 20 µl of nuclei suspension                    (∼10.000–20.000 nuclei) mixed with 180 µl of 1.7% low                    melting agarose in sucrose 0.25 M and immediately pipetted onto a frosted glass                    microscope slide pre-coated with a layer of 1% normal melting point                    agarose, prepared in PBS lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+.                    Three slides were prepared for each experimental point. The agarose was allowed                    to set at 4°C for the necessary time. After, slides were placed on a                    horizontal electrophoresis unit containing fresh buffer (1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH                    pH 13.0). Electrophoresis was then conducted in fresh electrophoresis buffer (pH                    13.0) for 15 min at 25 V and 300 mA (0.8 V/cm) at 4°C. Subsequently, the                    slides were gently washed in neutralization solution (0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5)                    for 5 min and fixed in 100% fresh methanol for 3 min. Slides were stained                    with 50 µl ethidium bromide (20 µg/ml) and covered with a coverslip.                    The main protocol for comet assay was based according by usual method [52]. Stained                    nucleoids were scored visually using a fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped                    with a camera COHU (20× magnification). Three slides were analyzed for                    each experimental point and comet images on each slide were acquired using the                    ‘I.A.S.’ automatic image analysis software purchased from Delta                    Sistemi (Rome, Italy). The comet images were digitalized and a statistical                    assessment of tail length was conducted.
The experiment is illustrated in Scheme S2 (Supporting information). Nuclei                    from one gram of five different rat tissues were de-shielded with 50 mM NaCl,                    washed three times with 10 ml of 0.25 M sucrose and resuspended in 0.25 M                    sucrose (10 ml). Two samples for each tissue (1 ml) were incubated for 2 hours                    at 25°C with trypsin and proteinase K (1.0 mg/ml final concentration). A                    third sample was incubated only with 50 mM NaCl, and a fourth sample taken as                    simple control (sample D). After incubation the samples were washed three times                    in 0.25 M sucrose. Proteolyzed and control nuclei from liver, kidney, heart,                    lung and brain were incubated with their corresponding cytosolic fractions for                    20 minutes at 25°C, and then washed three times with 0.25 M sucrose. The                    amount of re-constituted shield was evaluated by measuring the proteins or Alpha                    GST detached by 50 mM NaCl.
