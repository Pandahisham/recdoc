A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ALTHESIN AND THIOPENTONE IN MODIFIED E.C.T.

The present report compares Thiopentone sodium and Althesin as intravenous anaesthetic agents in modified electro-convulsive therapy. The induction time with althesin and thiopentone was more or less similar. There was significantly shorter recovery period with althesin as compared to thiopentone. Early and uneventful recovery with althesin was distinct advantage over thiopentone sodium.
