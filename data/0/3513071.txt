324â€ƒEvaluation of Chest Computed Tomography in Patients with Asthma

Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways. The pathophysiological effects of airway obstruction include air trapping and dynamic hyperinflation. The investigation of asthma is usually performed through pulmonary function tests. The assessment of asthma by radiological methods is required to rule out other causes of bronchospasm or out complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes found in the chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with persistent asthma.
Sixty-nine patients of both genders and above 18 years of age, accompanied by persistent asthma, participated in the study. The charts were analyzed for severity and onset of symptoms of asthma, spirometry, search of specific IgE and chest tomography.
The mean age was 55.7 years, 71% female. Asthma began in childhood in 55.8% of patients. All patients had persistent asthma, divided into 66.7% of severe asthma, 29% moderate and only 4.3% mild. Only 14.5% of spirometry was normal. Atopy, assessed by clinical history and research of specific IgE was observed in 75.8% of patients. Regarding CT scans of the chest, the primary findings were bronchial wall thickening in 70% of patients, nodules in 25%, and atelectasis in 25%. The bronchiectasis was present in 20% of CT scans of the chest, and signs of emphysema in 10% of them.
In this trial, the CT scans of the chest were primarily indicated for patients with severe persistent allergic asthma. Bronchiectasis was found in 20% of tests, suggesting that CT scan of the chest should be required for patients with partial response to conventional treatment, mainly in patients with severe asthma.
