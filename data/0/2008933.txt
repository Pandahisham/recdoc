Methotrexate in Liver and Bile after Intravenous Dosage in Man

Measurements of methotrexate have been made in the liver and plasma of 4 patients and in the bile and plasma of 1 patient receiving [3H]methotrexate. Projections from a theoretical model of concentration of methotrexate in liver are confirmed but projections of biliary excretion are not.
