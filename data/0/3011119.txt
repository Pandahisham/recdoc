WORK PERFORMANCE OF SCHIZOPHRENIC DAY BOARDERS IN AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY CENTRE

Performance of 129 schizophrenics attending the Occupational Therapy Ceâ€²ntre at NIMHANS, Bangalore as day boarders has been assessed on a 5 point scale, and by Griffiths Work behaviour assessment scale and correlated with various demographic and clinical characteristics.
Those unemployed earlier had significantly (P < .005) poorer work performance. Poor social support (P < .05) and presence of residual symptoms (P < .001) were also significantly related to poor work performance. Other demographic characteristics, sub-type of schizophrenia, duration of illness and age of onset of illness did not influence work performance significantly. The implication of these findings in rehabilitation of schizophrenics are discussed.
