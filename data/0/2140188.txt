Yale University medical and PA students, classes of 2010 and 2008 respectively, express their gratitude in a compilation of reflections on learning human anatomy. In coordination with the Section of Anatomy and Experimental Surgery at the School of Medicine, the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine encourages you to hear the stories of the body as narrated by the student.

A surgeon's hands always dive violently into a human body whether it is alive or not. This is the first thing a Yale student of anatomy will notice ― that is, after she finally copes with the lifeless body before her. The surgeon's actions can be explained most simply by a loss. He has lost something that the anatomy student still has: inexperience. The surgeon's decisiveness is not a mark of insensitivity, but of a certain confidence cultivated over many seasons. The surgeon knows the body well. He respects it. He is familiar with its resilience. If we can say that the student is more "sensitive" to the body, it is only because he enters it blindly, not quite sure what to reach for. Every moment ― and every movement ― is practiced with caution, and nothing is done without first hesitating. Indeed, for some students, the first anatomical movements are movements away from the body.
Recalling the "several fast sweeps of the scalpel" that first revealed what lay beneath the skin, one student writes that "the movement was violent . . . I felt sick. I stuck it out for a few moments, and then went to the ladies' room. I sat on the tile floor for four or five minutes." While dissecting the aorta, another student writes of his "own heart beating at the back of my throat . . . I had to take a moment away from the table." 
When students write about the body, however, they recognize and return to the body. It is in these reflexive moments that readers find some of the most cautious, thoughtful, and reverential advances toward the body.
The movements of the anatomical experience are collected each year by health professional students at Yale University School of Medicine during a service of gratitude in which they create art, poetry, music, essays, and stories. The pieces presented here by medical and PA students, classes of 2010 and 2008, respectively, are a record of those movements and the student's contemplative process ― a process that yields insights that are different but no less valuable than the surgeon's.
In time, the manner in which these students hold up and move toward the body will profoundly change ― and with it their very notion of the body and its purpose, structure, and meaning.

After my dissection partners and I remove the chest wall, we attempt to make sense of the closely packed organs.
"My god, there's her heart," someone says. Maybe it was me.
"Her lungs are so fleshy," someone else observes from a distance.
"I think that's the thymus," another offers.
No one touches anything.
"Retract the lungs laterally and inferiorly to expose the superior hilum," our dissection manual commands. Our goal is to find the hilum, a deep structure that connects heart to lung, encircle it with our thumb and middle finger, and note its circumference in order to approximate the depth of our incision. Once the hilum is divided, we will be able to remove the lung from the chest.
With care, we pull back the upper lobe of the lung, but it refuses to give way. It has formed hidden attachments and adhesions with the heart during their 87-year-long embrace. My lab partners and I pry and prod, but to no avail. We are totally confounded, and it must be showing on our faces because our section leader, a retired Yale surgeon, is asking us what is wrong.
"The lung. It's stuck," I respond.
The surgeon steps up on a stool, crooks his body over the deceased, and without hesitation sends a gloved hand into a narrow crevice.
"You have to dig deep!" he says with one forearm in the chest cavity, the other resting on our donor's belly, and a head swung back to address us. "Put your hands here! And wrap your fingers here! Now make your incision!"
When we finally free the lung from the heart, the surgeon cradles and stretches it in his hands to demonstrate movement during inspiration. As the lung returns to its relaxed state, foam begins to bubble out of the bronchi.
"My god," I say, "is that trapped air from her last breaths?"
"No," the surgeon responds with a surgeon's expertise. "Just an effect of embalming."
That first day, I listened to other people recount how meaningful the experience had been for them and wondered, or worried, about how meaningful this dissection would be for me.
* * *
When we were told that we were going to meet our donors, I remember feeling totally unprepared. Looking back now, I realize there is nothing one can really do to prepare for the overwhelming and strange experience of meeting someone who has donated his body to you.
* * *
When we opened the cases and pulled back the plastic coverings, I remember being struck at how real the bodies looked, despite their lifelessness. It took me by surprise ― I wanted to shout for joy and cry at the same time.
* * *
I remember seeing his hands and being struck at how much that reminded me he was alive before.
* * *
I had never touched someone who had died before, and when I put my fingers on the shoulder of our donor and felt how cold it was, as cold as the metal table, it felt like there was a huge disconnect in my mind between what I expected and what I felt. I felt a little dizzy, as if the floor was falling away beneath my feet.
* * *
I cried. Yes, I was the girl standing above the head of the donor with quiet tears. Not only was I standing above a dead body that I would become intimate with, but I was also about to embark upon the quintessential experience of medical school.  It was really happening; I was becoming a medical student.
How difficult it was to get used to touching him.
* * *
I hadn't checked my donor's genitalia and referred to her as "he" and had to be corrected by one of my lab partners and thought to myself, "Oh my God, I can't tell male from female.  HOW am I going to be a doctor?"
***
We found the dressings on her open bedsores. We removed one, not realizing what it was. The second one we left; it didn't seem appropriate to take that off. She was a person then, at that moment and from every moment henceforth. "Donor" never really quite fit for me ― a donor gives something; the people who donated to us quite literally gave themselves.
* * *
Although applying paint externally was to be one of the less invasive things we did to our donors' bodies, I felt kind of weird "decorating" them in that way.
* * *
I had the urge to put my hand on my donor's shoulder, as though to comfort her. Even with the face covered, I kept getting distracted and thinking about who this person might have been.
* * *
I was amazed at how different the body topography is from what I expected. I realized that when I clutch the center of my chest to gesture heartbreak, I probably should be a little more to the left and more superior.
The first incision was the most memorable moment in lab.
* * *
I had so many conflicting emotions. It was empowering to hold a scalpel and almost exhilarating to have this huge, untouched specimen at our disposal. There was an incredible excitement at the beginning to see things that most people will never see. There were also feelings of inadequacy. I was inept at making stitches and tying knots, and it was one of the first times in medical school when I was asked to do something totally outside my previous experience and ability.
* * *
We were all reluctant, because the incision somehow felt like an act of violation. The first incisions brought home to me the intimacy of the relationship into which we were entering. We were about to learn a great deal about what this man suffered and, ultimately, how he died.
* * *
A surgeon came over to speed the process up because we were behind. He made several fast sweeps of the scalpel and peeled back the skin. The movement was violent, and I felt sick. I stuck it out for a few moments and then went to the ladies' room. I sat on the tile floor for four or five minutes before I was ready to go back.
* * *
With what we thought was great precision, we made our way through the layers of the body wall, arriving at an unknown structure in the right upper quadrant. Identify. After ruling out the pancreas, we had nearly settled on the liver, when further timid probing revealed a somewhat familiar texture. "Wait," I said without thinking and, in all seriousness, asked, "Is this liver, or poop?" Then I wanted to laugh. I could feel that we all did, but we didn't. At least not until we noticed an all-too-familiar smell and agreed without any doubt that we had incised ― no, cut into ― the colon. We all laughed after that, but I felt guilty:  What if our donor had known that even our best efforts could be ignorant and clumsy?  Would he still have made the same decision?
I remember holding my donor's breast in my hand after we removed it and being shocked that I had done such a thing and how blasé I felt about it. Before we could grasp what we had done, we were holding in our hands a part of the body that carries such personal significance. I wondered whether our donor had nourished children with that breast.
* * *
I remember wondering as we removed the chest plate, which is a rather brutal procedure, if the donor had known what we were going to do to her body. I admired her all the more for having the courage to blindly entrust her body to us in the faith that we would make good use of the gift.
* * *
Our donor was so fragile we were able to cut the ribs with a scalpel.
What struck me most about the mock pneumonectomy was seeing the ravages of lung cancer on one donor, compared to healthy lungs on another.
* * *
I looked at another group's donor and saw the flaccid sac that his right lung had become.  The mass on his left side could have been mistaken for a pad of butter. For a moment, I couldn't breathe.
* * *
Seeing the bronchi and the vessels side by side was one of those moments in anatomy in which I felt like the dissection was really justified, as it truly helped me understand how things are organized and why and gave me the essential visual image. More than anything, holding an organ in your hands reminds you how much each piece of anatomy is a work of art.
* * *
The texture of the lungs was like nothing I'd ever felt before or since. My hands remember it.
My donor had a big heart.
* * *
I kept trying to imagine his heart beating in that cavity for 79 years, his lungs expanding and contracting.
* * *
After this lab, I had to run errands. As I was standing in the grocery store, I was struck by a question: What would the people around me think if they knew I had just removed the heart of a dead person and held it in my hand?
* * *
I remember seeing the left recurrent laryngeal and vagus nerves and being almost surprised that they really existed; a lot of anatomy seemed like a myth before I saw it.
* * *
This was the first lab in which things were not normal, the anatomy wasn't what we expected from the book. As we dissected the heart, we found metal. One of our donor's valves had been replaced. Then another, and another. In all, we found two metal valves and an artificial pig valve. Something so artificial as metal was a vital part of what was keeping this woman alive, keeping her human. I started thinking about how we are able to replace more and more of the human body with artificial parts. I wondered, at what point does someone become more machine than human. What is the essence of humanity? Is it the brain, the heart, or something else?
* * *
Sometimes, when I get nervous, I feel a knot or tightness in my chest right under my sternum. After this lab, I wonder what it is in the mediastinum that knows I'm worried and feels so strange.
My donor's azygos vein is on the wrong side. This doesn't make a difference, of course, but somehow this fact makes me happy.
* * *
When I ran my fingers with some pressure down his descending aorta, where we were to perform the aneurism repair, there was a crunching noise, and I could feel something breaking off inside this huge vessel. My mind was flooded with textbook and TV images of atherosclerotic plaques. With my hand in his chest, those images became horrifying because they then had a human face ― and not just any face, but one that likely suffered from this strange phenomenon of disease, one that was now dead. I remembered this disease is common, and it causes many people and their loved ones so much suffering. I could feel my own heart beating at the back of my throat, and I had to take a moment away from the table.
I remember walking home one night after studying the radiology exercises with the angiograms of the mesenteric arteries. The moon was out and had cast a shadow of tree branches on the sidewalk. The branches were bent and tangled in such a way that I immediately thought of the celiac trunk. I realized for the first time that my knowledge of medicine had transformed my perception of ordinary things.
* * *
It was this lab in which we figured out our donor actually died of an abdominal aneurism, not because of "respiratory failure," the cause listed on the door next to our table number.
* * *;
We opened up the abdomen and found a tangled mess. The omentum was not to be found, intestines swirled. The ascending colon was on the wrong side. Several surgeons and anatomists later, we still weren't sure why. Maybe it was a congenital malformation.  Maybe it was surgery. It was an uncomfortable feeling, looking at something that should make sense and feeling totally disoriented.
Justified or not, this lab gave me one more reason not to eat liver. I was shocked at how green the gall bladder was. The abdomen was a challenge for us between the adhesions and the handfuls of clotted blood that seemed to be waiting for us in every recess. Often we felt that even the surgeons avoided our table because it was so difficult to find anything and so distasteful to look at.  Our group of four would stray one by one to other tables and come back, saying things like, "You should see their common bile duct," our tone half envious, half full of amused incredulity that we had, by chance, been given such a challenge.
We excavated the kidney from a cavern of fat. When it was done and the fat was piled on the table, it looked like scrambled eggs. I have not eaten scrambled eggs since.
* * *
With all of the vascular damage we had seen elsewhere in our donor, we were not expecting healthy kidneys. It surprises me now to remember how relieved I was for him when we found his kidneys appeared perfectly healthy.
Taking the course has given me a much greater understanding of the various diseases I hear about. When I hear about inguinal hernias, I have a mental picture of exactly what is happening inside the body. No book could ever teach you that.
* * *
A varicocele was described to us as "a bag of worms." I thought of this unfortunate image when we found a varicocele in our donor's scrotum.
There is something very strange about holding a uterus in your hand, especially one that has become small and atrophied with old age ― it's hard to imagine that this uterus had once carried children. It's hard to imagine that an organ just like the one in my hand once carried me.
* * *
I wonder what my donor's family is like? Big? Small? Children? Grandkids?
* * *
I still have not made peace with myself about this lab, and during the service of gratitude, I will likely be silently asking my donor's forgiveness for my blundering.
His sciatic nerve was bigger than my thumb.
* * *
The head of the femur was smooth, as if it had been machined in a factory. I was glad my donor had not struggled with arthritis pain.
* * *
Moving on to the musculoskeletal system was a relief after having spent the past few labs in the murky areas of abdomen and pelvis.
* * *
I was surprised at the violence, the brute force, required to pull the head of the femur out of the acetabulum, and I remember wanting the thing to come out perfectly round, like in the pictures from Gray's. It didn't.
I loved seeing the cruciate ligaments and learning how to test if they are intact.
* * *
You hear so much about ACL tears. Who would've thought the thing was so little?
* * *
I was amazed by the color of the tendons in the ankle. They even refracted light, and I stared in amazement as I saw a rainbow beneath my donor's flesh.
I didn't realize how difficult the arm dissection would be ― but just like our faces, it is the only part of our bodies that is routinely uncovered. This was one of the most personal and most difficult dissections.
* * *
The brachial plexus seemed so complicated at first, but seeing the "M" surrounding the brachial artery and then following the course of the nerves through the arm led me to a newfound appreciation for the incredible organization of the arm.
I am amazed at how complicated the back is. I could not have understood that without looking at a human body. I have a different level of appreciation for how the body moves.
* * *
I was completely amazed by the cauda equina.
* * *
The emergence of the spinal roots from the cord had been abstracted on the white board in so many O'Brien sessions, but until I saw it on the donors I couldn't imagine what it looked like.
* * *
I SAW A SPINAL CORD!!!
* * *
It was so much smaller than I imagined ― you mean to say that when this tiny thing is injured, you may not be able to walk again ― or worse?
I put my hand in his, to know what it would be like to shake his hand.
* * * 
The hand is such an intimate part of the body, and when we opened up the forearm and hand, I was struck by the beauty and intricacy of tendons running down to fingers.
When we decided not to remove the larynx, I was quietly happy. It seems like something that shouldn't be taken out. It's odd that I did not exactly feel this way about the heart, the lungs, or even the brain.
The beginning of the end . . .
* * *
It made me sad to not be able to see him as he was when we started.
* * *
It was bizarre and unnerving to be fanning bone dust out of my face as we sawed into the skull, to see scraps of hair and dura floating in little pools of fluid, to be holding what was the seat of our donor's consciousness in my hands.
* * *
After the shock, guilt, and disgust of sawing open a human skull, the thrill of removing an intact brain was really something. The circle of Willis came alive in 3D when I finally saw it on my donor's brain.
* * *
This was a very tough experience, but one I'm glad I had the opportunity to have. When I looked around the room, I could understand how some people view doctors as mad scientists.
The extraocular muscles were perhaps one of the coolest things I saw this year.
* * *
I remember listening to the ophthalmologist show us first the cow eye and then the human eye. As common as it may be, I am still reluctant to believe that you can replace someone's diseased lens with an artificial one.
* * *
I thought I appreciated the beauty of the human eye until I looked at the iris through the slit lamp in the hallway. My appreciation was so superficial.
"We will now perform a very radical and emotionally disturbing procedure."
* * *
Watching a head sawed in half was one of the most difficult things I have ever had to witness. However, seeing the mid-saggital section was an invaluable learning experience for me, as I tried to develop an understanding of the spatial relationships within the head. I think the mixture of reluctance and eagerness, guilt and curiosity, repulsion, and gratitude captures the experience of anatomy lab as a whole.
