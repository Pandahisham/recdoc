RELATION OF VARICELLA TO HERPES ZOSTER 

 Varicella most frequently occurs in individuals under 10 years of age, while zoster as a rule is observed in persons beyond that age. The number of cases of varicella exhibits a markedly constant seasonal variation. The variations in the prevalence of herpes zoster are not regular and do not parallel those of varicella.
