Unusual Obstruction of Nasojejunal Feeding Tube


Despite good practice of caring, blockage of feeding tube is a common problem. We encountered a patient with severe acute pancreatitis in the ICU with a nasojejunal tube for enteral feeding. Later on, due to obstruction in the feeding tube, we took it out and found, unexpectedly, the lumen of the feeding tube occluded by Ascaris lumbricoides [Figure 1].[12] Therefore, this occlusion by A. lumbricoides could be considered as a cause of feeding tube obstruction, especially in endemic areas where the burden of this disease is huge.[3]
