Transport of immunoglobulins from serum into colostrum

Oligomeric, J-chain-containing immunoglobulins were observed to be transferred selectively from serum into colostrum. These studies suggest that, in the case of the mammary gland secretion, a significant role for extraglandular synthesis of IgA merits consideration. Thus, for example, colostrum may contain antibodies synthesized locally as well as antibodies synthesized in the much larger lymphoid tissues such as the gut lamina propria.
