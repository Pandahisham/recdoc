STUDY OF TRANSFUSED BLOOD 

 Evidence is presented to show that there is no hemolytic toxin producing the anemia in pernicious anemia. Partial evidence is presented to show that the periods of active blood destruction which are seen as the exception in pernicious anemia cases during a series of transfusions are due to the activity of the blood-destroying organs of the body rather than to the intrinsic weakness of the pernicious anemia blood corpuscle. It is questionable whether blood destruction is as important a factor in producing the anemia of pernicious anemia as it is at present usually assumed to be.
