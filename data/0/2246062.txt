A 32-year-old Caucasian woman of body mass index (BMI) 46 presented with urinary symptoms to accident and emergency (A&E). Acute pyelonephritis was the diagnosis. Transabdominal scan revealed a live term fetus. Both the partners were unaware of the ongoing pregnancy until diagnosed. She underwent emergency cesarean under general anaesthesia (GA) for nonreassuring CTG, severe chorioamnionitis, and moderate preecclampsia. A live male baby weighing 4400 grams delivered in poor condition. Placental tissue on culture exhibited scanty growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chorioamnionitis due to pseudomonas is rare, with high neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is mostly reported among preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). Educating the community especially morbidly obese women if they put on excessive weight or with irregular periods should seek doctor's advice and exclude pregnancy. For the primary care provider, it is of great importance to exclude pregnancy in any reproductive woman presenting with abdominal complaints. This case also brings to clinicians notice that pseudomonas can be community-acquired and can affect term pregnancies with intact or prolonged rupture of membranes.

A 32-year-old Caucasian woman with BMI 46 presented to “A&E” withdysuria, urinary frequency, and incontinence, along with bilateral lointenderness and vomiting. Her initial observations were as follows: pulse 135,BP 151/114, and temp. 36.6. Urine dipstick revealed 3+ protein, blood,leucocytes, and ketones. Liver and renal function tests, uric acid, amylase,random blood sugar, and clotting screen were within normal range; Hb 10.0,white cell count of 26.2 with Neutrophils at 23.32, platelets 454, andCßreactive protein >180 mg/L. Haematology report also showed microcytichypochromic blood picture. Midstream urine was sent for culture and sensitivity.The immediate impression was that of acute pyelonephritis and treatmentcommenced with IV Cefuroxime and surgical review requested. On abdominalexamination, a large, mobile, nontender mass was palpated with positiveurine pregnancy test.
Subsequently, transabdominal scan revealed a single live term fetus withcephalic presentation, reduced liquor (amniotic fluid index of 5), effective foetalweight of 3.9 kg,and with right lateral placenta. She was then transferred to delivery suite.This was her first pregnancy and both partners were unaware of the ongoingpregnancy until diagnosed. She gave vague history of constant vaginaldischarge. Until then, she was on continuous contraceptive pills. Past medicaland surgical history suggested nothing significant, and there was no ongoingpsychiatric illness. Interestingly, she presented to general practitioner (GP)at least twice with complaints of backache and urinary symptoms prior todelivery. Although GP recommendedtreatment for UTI with trimethoprim, she did not take them due to thosemedications causing sickness.
Upon admission to delivery suite, her observations were pulse 127, BP160/102, and temp. 37.6 with 3 in 10 uterine contractions. Also noted were 2+generalised oedema, 3+ proteinuria, and normal reflexes. Cardiotocographreading showed baseline tachycardia at 170, variability <5, no accelerations,and variable decelerations. Vaginal examination revealed cervix 5 cm dilated,1+ caput, vertex −2 station, and malodorous vaginal discharge on rupture ofmembranes. She underwent emergency caesarean section under GA for fetaldistress, severe chorioamnionitis, and moderate preecclampsia. There was delayin starting the caesarean due to difficulty in securing the IV access, threefailed attempts at spinal, failed catheterisation as pus pouring from thevagina, and due to body habitus.
A live male baby weighing 4400 grams was delivered and handed over topaediatrician. Intraoperative findings revealed offensive liquor in the form offrank pus draining from the uterus, J-shaped uterine incision due to difficultyin delivering the shoulders, pus draining from foetal nose and mouth, normallooking bilateral tubes and ovaries, and a corrugated catheter drain left inthe peritoneal cavity due to peritoneal contamination of uterine contents.Vagina was swabbed and Foleys catheter was inserted into bladder. Estimated blood losswas at 700 mL.
Placental and cervical swabs were taken for culture and sensitivity, andplacenta was sent for histology. Postoperatively IV Augmentin continued for 48 hoursand then oral for 21 days, Labetalol 200 mg orally twice daily for 2 weeks,iron supplements for next 3 months, subcutaneous Tinzaparin 4500 IU for 5 days,and leg stockings until she mobilised. She also received 3 units of blood transfusionin view of her Hb 6.1 gm/dL. All her observations including haematological andbiochemical parameters improved over 72 hours. Drain removed on Day six. Shewas rubella immune and negative for Hepatitis B, Syphilis, and HIV 1 and 2. Nopathogenic organisms isolated from urine specimen, placental, and cervicalswabs. Placental tissue on culture exhibited scanty growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive to Ceftazidime, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Imipenem, and Tazocin. Sherecuperated uneventfully and discharged home on Day 16.
The APGAR scores for the baby at 1, 5, 10, and 20 minutes were 2, 3, 5,and 7, respectively. Baby was in poor condition at birth and had to beresuscitated and admitted to Special Care Baby Unit. Arterial and venous bloodgas pH values were 7.217 and 7.130, respectively. Similarly arterial and venousbase deficits were −8.9 and −7.9 mmol/L. Baby developed septicaemia due to Staphylococcusepidermis and were treated with antibiotics for seven days. There weredevelopmental delays and a diagnosis of Grade 3 hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathywas made. Baby was discharged home on Day 22 after establishing bottle feeds.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is primarily a nocosomial pathogen, Gram-negative, aerobic,rod-shaped bacterium [1]. Among several commensal flora in the vagina, Pseudomonasaeruginosa accounts for nearly 2% [2]. Chorioamnionitis due to Pseudomonasaeruginosa is rare and its importance is due to its virulence, with highneonatal morbidity and mortality [3–5].Pseudomonas chorioamnionitis are mostly reported among women with PPROM and in their babies [6, 7]. One of the risk factors identified in literature is prolonged antibiotictherapy in these women [8]. In the case presented, reported infectionmight have been either community-acquired or opportunistic, due to alteredlocal vaginal flora or generalised immune suppression with haematogenousdissemination. Chorioamnionitis per se could be due to prolonged rupture ofmembranes or consequent upon urinary tract infection although infection withintact membranes cannot be ruled out due to its high virulence. She gave nohistory suggestive of prolonged antibiotic therapy. Low socioeconomic status, poormaternal nutrition, and the fact no antenatal care may all have predisposed tothis highly virulent pathogenic chorioamnionitis. Gestational diabetes is notruled out. Consequently, poor outcome of the baby at delivery is the result ofsevere chorioamnionitis leading to unsafe intrauterine milieu. The Staphylococcusepidermis sepsis in the neonate could have been acquired followingdelivery, especially with interventions such as mechanical ventilation andintubation. Our patient was at risk of septicaemia, shock, disseminatedintravascular coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorganfailure [9]. Despite the low incidence of maternal morbidity, these women should beregarded as high-risk labor due to increased perinatal morbidity [10]. Negative placental swabs may be due to IV Cefuroxime commenced earlier inA&E for UTI to which the organism was susceptible as revealed in theplacental tissue culture. The reason for starting and continuing Augmentin wasdue to departmental protocol and for its broad-spectrum activity, as well asimprovement in patients’ clinical condition.
This case by definition is a true denial of pregnancy. In other words,unconscious denial of pregnancy whereby pregnancy is denied at all levels—physiological, psychological, and social [11]. Theprevalence of this kind of pregnancy is 1 out of every 2455 births, wherein thefetus was born without any preceding subjective awareness of pregnancy on thepart of the woman [12].
During postnatal period, appropriate counseling had been given with regard to parenting skills and referral made to social services. A named midwife and health visitor had been appointed to provide any assistance that this woman and her baby may require. Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric consultation was rare for women who had denied or concealed their pregnancies, and yet they would often subsequently take responsibility for their infants [13].
It is important toprovide multidisciplinary consultant-led care when the patient is in thehospital and liaise with other professionals, such as social services,community midwife, and health care visitors to provide high quality of care tothese patients.
It is difficult to understand what led tototal ignorance or insensible to pregnancy changes until full term anddelivery. Probably social, psychological, physical factors, or all of them had a role toplay. Educatingthe community especially morbidly obese women if they put on excessive weightor with irregular periods should seek doctor's advice and exclude pregnancy.For the primary care provider it is of great importance to exclude pregnancy inany reproductive woman presenting with abdominal complaints.
This case also brings to clinicians notice that Pseudomonas may havebeen acquired in the community and affect term pregnancies with intact orprolonged rupture of membranes.
