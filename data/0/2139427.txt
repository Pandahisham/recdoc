AN ELECTROPHORETIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURFACE AND SECRETED IGM OF MURINE SPLENOCYTES

 µ-chains on the surface of murine splenocytes are more heterogeneous on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than both secreted and intracellular µ-chains labeled with [3H]tyrosine. No difference in heterogeneity among cell surface, secreted, or intracellular L chains was detected. The possible role of carbohydrate in µ-chain heterogeneity is discussed.
