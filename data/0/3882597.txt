Toxoplasma encephalitis in an HIV-positive patient – a case report


Toxoplasmosis still represents the most frequent complication affecting the CNS of patients with AIDS.
We present a case of Toxoplasma encephalitis in a 23 year-old patient with HIV infection, with fatal outcome. For diagnosis we used neuroimaging methods (CT and MRI) that demonstrated multiple masses surrounded by edema and central-necrotic arias) and serum Toxoplasma IgG and IgM – high levels. Under co-trimoxazol treatment there was an improvement of the lesions on neuroimaging, in contrast with the worsening of the symptoms, convulsions and fatal outcome.
