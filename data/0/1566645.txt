The reproductive toxicity of boric acid.

Previous studies on the reproductive toxicity of boric acid have indicated that male rodents suffer testicular atrophy after treatment. There were, however, no studies of the potential effects on female fertility or on the neonate. In addition, no study described the development of the testicular lesion, thought to be related to the mechanism of toxicity. A Reproductive Assessment by Continuous Breeding (RACB) study using mice exposed to boric acid at 1000, 4500, and 9000 ppm in the diet indicated that there are probably multiple sites of action, although male fertility appears very sensitive. Possible effects on female fertility cannot be separated from potential developmental toxicity and need additional investigation. Decrements in sperm motility were observed at all exposure levels, and testicular atrophy was confirmed in high- and middle-dose-group males. This was investigated further by timed serial-sacrifice studies using 9000 ppm in the diet of rats, which found that the first lesion seen in the testis was an inhibition of spermiation (release of mature spermatids). With continued dosing, this was followed by a disorganization of the normal ordered layering of the seminiferous epithelium, germ cell sloughing and death, and finally, atrophy. Subsequent studies using additional doses (2000, 3000, 4500, 6000, and 9000 ppm) found that it was possible to observe inhibited spermiation that did not progress to atrophy (4500 ppm and below) within the 9-week exposure period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
