STUDIES ON BACTERIAL ENZYMES 

 The meningococcus cell contains a peptonase enzyme which hydrolyzes the peptides and similar constituents of commercial "peptone." The activity of this enzyme is independent of the presence of the formed bacterial cell. The peptonase enzyme is more resistant to heat and to oxidation than is the maltase enzyme of the same bacteria.
