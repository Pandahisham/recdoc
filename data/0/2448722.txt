Coccygodynia.

Ten coccygectomies were performed. Patients were all females (aged 26-74, average 46). All patients expressed satisfaction after the operation (one was deceased at the time of follow up). The material is too small for definitive conclusions, but it shows clearly that carefully selected cases with traumatic or idiopathic coccygodynia could benefit from coccygectomy.
