Objective. Our aim is to investigate sonographically detectable vault hematomas after vaginal hysterectomy and its relation to postoperative morbidity. Methods. We studied a group of 103 women who had undergone vaginal hysterectomy for benign causes apart from uterovaginal prolapse. Transabdominal ultrasound examinations were carried out 24 to 72 hours after surgery to assess the presence of vault hematomas. Ultrasound findings were correlated with clinical data and postoperative morbidity. Results. The incidence of vault hematoma was found 19.4% in present study. In these patients, 40% (8/20) had fever while only 2.4% (2/83) of cases without vault hematoma suffered from fever. Out of all women having vault hematoma, 70% (14/20) had small-sized hematoma and 30% (6/20) had large-sized hematoma. Fifty percent of patients (3/6) with large-sized hematoma, as compared to only 35% (5/14) with small-sized hematoma, suffered from febrile morbidity. Large-sized hematomas drained by vaginally, while all small-sized pelvic hematomas managed by watchful expectancy successfully. The significant difference was found mean hemoglobin drop and postoperative stay in the hematoma group or without hematoma group. Conclusion. Sonographic detection of vaginal vault fluid collection is common after hysterectomy, but such a finding rarely indicates additional treatment. Though febrile morbidity was more in cases with vault hematoma, the number of such patients was too small to be significant. Vaginal ultrasound examination should not be performed routinely after hysterectomy.

Gynecologists for uterovaginal prolapse preferred vaginalhysterectomy where anterior colporrhaphy and posteriorcolpoperineorrhaphy can be conveniently performed. This route isassociated with less febrile morbidity, less risk of hemorrhage,fewer blood transfusions, shorter hospitalization, and quickconvalescence as compared to abdominal route [1–3]. Even with this procedure, some complications like hemorrhage,postoperative fever, and infection were reported. The incidence ofvault hematoma after vaginal hysterectomy is variablyreported—from approximately 25% to as much as 98%[4–6]. Such disparity in diagnosis may be due to differingdefinitions of vault hematoma and/or diagnostic modalities. Thereare many applications of ultrasonography in gynecology, althoughthey are less crucial than in obstetrics. Role of ultrasonographyin routine evaluation of post-hysterectomy patients is new and therole is not well defined. Transabdominal sonography may be used todetect, and eventually guide the drainage of fluid collections.The present study focused on vaginal hysterectomy patientshaving transabdominal ultrasound to find the incidence ofpostoperative vault hematoma and its correlation withpostoperative morbidity.
The study was initiated as a prospective-observational study atEducation and Research Hospital, during the period of January 2003to January 2005 where 103 consecutive women who underwent vaginalhysterectomy, with pelvic floor repair operations. Each woman gaveconsent to the study before the operation. In each case, similaroperative techniques were employed by a variety of experiencedsurgeons. The vaginal vault was closed and not reperitonealised.Women received a single dose of intravenous antibiotics at time ofsurgery. Amount of blood loss, units of blood transfused, andoperating time were recorded for every patient. Postoperativemorbidity was assessed by the following parameters which includepostoperative fever, drop in hemoglobin (preoperative to third dayafter operation), and need for blood transfusion (excluding thosetransfused for preoperative anaemia). Febrile morbiditytemperature was >38°C on at least two days after operation.Preoperative anticoagulants did not administer all cases. Eachwoman had a transabdominal ultrasound examination by agynecologically trained ultrasonographer, on the first or thirdpostoperative day. The size of any vault collection(nonperistaltic complex echogenic mass) was classified small ifits mean diameter was <5 cm, and large if 5 cm or more.It was possible to divide these patients into two groups accordingto largest diameter of hematoma, to measure the significance ofsize with respect to postoperative morbidity. Theultrasonographers were not informed of other aspects of thewomen's postoperative recovery. Staff blinded to the ultrasoundfindings, documented nursing and medical records. Patients withdetected pelvic hematomas were subject to follow-up ultrasoundscan at after 7 days. Pelvic hematomas only had vaginal vaulthematoma. The patient of large-sized hematoma (>5 cm) wassubjected to evacuation of hematoma. Under lithotomy position,with aseptic precautions, without anaesthesia, the central twosutures of chromic catgut were removed, which was followed bydigital exploration and evacuation of hematoma. Patients withsmall-sized hematomas (<5 cm) were observed for spontaneousresolution of the hematoma and development of any complications.All patients were assessed preoperatively for presence of anyhigh-risk factors including hypertension, chronic intake ofaspirin, ischemic heart disease, anticoagulant therapy, diabetesmellitus, cerebrovascular disease, coagulation disturbance,chronic obstructive, or restrictive lung disease. The results weresubject to x2 test to assess significance. But this was notpossible due to lack of normal distribution (e.g., hemoglobindrop), the Mann-Whitney U test was applied. All analyses werepassed through SPSS software package. A P value of <.005 wasconsidered statistically significant.
The 103 patients who underwent vaginal operations were assessedfor various parameters. Twenty (19.4%) had a vaginal vaulthematoma (Group 1) and 83 (80%) had no hematoma (Group 2) weredetected (Table 1). The largest diameter of thehematoma varied between 2 cm and 9 cm. Mean age 52.32± 10.7 and 50.29 ± 6.51 was detected in two groups. Nosignificant difference was observed in the mean operativetime that was 95 minutes in patients with hematoma and 110 minutesin those without hematoma. The average drop in hemoglobin was, asanticipated, higher in those women with a hematoma. Eleven percent(12/103) of patients, 40% of the patients with pelvic hematomas,developed postoperative morbidity. Febrile morbidity wasevident since 40% (8/20) of patients in Group 1 compared to only2.4% (2/83) in Group 2 experienced febrile morbidity. Thedifference was statistically significant. Out of all women havingvault hematoma, 70% (14/20) had small-sized hematoma and 30%(6/20) had large-sized hematoma (Table 2). Fiftypercent of patients (3/6) with large-sized hematoma as compared toonly 25% (5/14) with small-sized hematoma suffered from febrilemorbidity. Largest percentage of hematomas belonged to small-sizedhematoma and it was about two times larger than thesubgroup. Of the 103 women, 4 required preoperative bloodtransfusion due to either operative bleeding or drop inhemoglobin, or both. One woman in the nonhematoma group requiredblood transfusion and excessive blood loss was documented atoperation, estimated at >500 mL. In the group with ahematoma, three women required transfusions and only two of thesehad excessive operative bleeding noted. Large-sized hematomas withfebril morbidity (3/6) drained vaginally. Small vaginal vaulthematomas were managed by no active intervention. Follow-up scanswere done weekly. A mean duration of 25 days was required forresolution of the hematoma. None of the patients in either grouprequired readmission to the hospital for any postoperativecomplications.
A postoperative pelvic hematoma can cause serious morbidity,especially if it is large and becomes infected. Many patients maybe asymptomatic; whereas some may present with postoperativebleeding per vaginum (spotting to profuse bleeding per vaginum)postoperative discomfort, abdominal distension, paralytic ileus,continuous fever, foul smelling discharge per vaginum, abscessformation, tenesmus, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Some authorssuggested that the presence of sonographically diagnosed pelvichematoma is associated with febrile morbidity [7], while others were unable to demonstrate such a relationship[5, 9, 10]. In our study, the overall incidence of vaulthematoma was 19.4%, 70% had small-sized hematoma and 30% had large-sized hematoma. In other studies, incidence of postoperativehematoma was detected 25–98% [4, 7]. Differences insurgical technique may be one explanation for thisdiscrepancy, particularly the degree to which the extraperitonealspace adjacent to the vaginal vault is obliterated. In our study,no statistical difference was found in the mean duration ofpostoperative hospital stay in the two groups. Haineset al. support these findings [10]. The hematoma group was also prone to a greater drop in hemoglobin concentration and spenton average 2.6 days longer in hospital than those with nohematoma. The percentage of hemoglobin drop and the number ofpatients showing the drop in our study are in total contradictionto other studies [5, 7]. In our study, 40% in patients with vaginal vault hematoma developed postoperative febrile morbidity. Kuhn and de Crespigny,utilizing transabdominal ultrasonography, evaluated 50 consecutivepatients following vaginal hysterectomy [4]. There are majordifferences between their findings and the present study, mostnotably a claimed incidence of vaginal vault collection of 98%compared with 19.4% in the present study. In the same study, Kuhnalso reported a higher incidence of postoperative pyrexia; 70%compared with 11% in the present study [4]. Postoperative febrile morbidity was 16 times more common in subjects withhematoma compared to those without hematoma. Toglia and Pearlmansupport these findings, in their study 69% of women withpostoperative pelvic collection experienced febrile morbiditycompared to 12% of those with no collection [8]. In another study, incidence of febrile morbidity was 31% in patients withvaginal vault hematomas [7]. However, other recent studies ofsmall sample populations have concluded that collections of fluidat the vaginal vault following hysterectomy do not contribute topostoperative morbidity. Although Haines and Slavotinek found nosignificant relation between the detection of vault hematoma andtheir defined parameters for postoperative morbidity, each studydid show a trend towards an increase in febrile morbidity inpatients with a hematoma [5, 10]. In another study, there wasno correlation between the presence of a collection and indices ofpostoperative morbidity [8]. Ultrasonography is helpful in detecting and delineating its exact size and location of pelvichematomas. In the same study, 42% patients had vaginal vaulthematoma on sonographic assessment. A review of recent literaturereveals that other studies incorporating postoperativetransvaginal ultrasound have shown a higher prevalence of vaulthematoma following hysterectomy, ranging from 34% to 59%[11]. An extended morbid and complicated postoperative course can be alleviated if the hematoma can be drained. A small penrosedrain may be inserted through the drainage tract and left in placefor a day or so. If drainage cannot be achieved in this simpleway, drainage with guidance of ultrasonography, or if it fails,then using computed tomography or through an abdominal incisionmay be necessary. If the hematoma can be drained, the patient'srecovery will be more prompt. In exceptional cases where drainagemay be difficult or contraindicated and infection is not a seriousproblem, the hematoma may be allowed to gradually resolve over afew months. Unfortunately sometimes, a hematoma will not resolvecompletely but persists and continues to cause pain. In our study,all the postoperative large hematomas were situated in closeproximity to the vaginal vault; hence vaginal drainage waspossible. Small vaginal vault hematomas were unlikely to causepostoperative morbidity. They were left alone with watchfulexpectancy and follow-up ultrasonography for resolution of thehematoma done weekly. This study suggests that asymptomatic pelvichematomas can be recognized by early postoperative ultrasound scanwhich are unlikely to be detected clinically. Using postoperativeultrasound, we can identify a population of women at increasedrisk of postoperative morbidity following vaginal hysterectomy.Large-sized hematoma may develop postoperative morbidity andrequired vaginal drainage of the hematoma. All patientsundergoing vaginal hysterectomy alone do not require undergoingroutine postoperative pelvic ultrasound scan.
