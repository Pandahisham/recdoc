NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS PRESENTING AS PSYCHOTIC DEPRESSION : MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT WITH A COURSE OF ECT & PHARMACOTHERAPY : A CASE REPORT

The characteristic symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are dementia, urinary incontinence and gait disturbance. Psychiatric symptoms make their appearance usually after the characteristic symptoms. In some cases, however, prominent psychiatric symptoms are the presenting picture even before the cognitive decline is evident. A case of NPH is discussed which presented with psychotic depression along with urinary incontinence. CT scan showed dilated supratentonal ventricular system and normal fourth ventricle. There was slight widening of cortical sulci. The cognitive impairment set in later during the course of illness. The psychiatric symptoms responded fairly well to a course of ECT and antidepressant drugs.
