Purpose. Primary extra-osseous osteosarcomas are uncommon            lesions, and those originating within the lung are especially rare, with few case reports            existing in the literature.
Patient. We report the case of a 48-year-old male smoker with a primary            osteosarcoma of the right lower lung lobe.
Results. Diagnosis was based on histopathological findings of a poorly            differentiated sarcoma with malignant cellular components of osteoid and chondroid matrix,            along with immunohistochemical and electron microscopy confirmation.            Extensive clinical and radiographic evaluation failed to reveal any tumor at other anatomical            sites.
