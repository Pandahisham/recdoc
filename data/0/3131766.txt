Hydatid disease is an important, equally neglected disease of increasing burden in many regions around the world. We report a Sudanese male who was firstly presented with a neck swelling, then found to have a single cystic shadow on a chest radiograph and CT. The patientsâ€™ history was unremarkable, except that he was a farmer and had contact with dogs and lived in rural community. Successful surgery (Posterolateral thoracotomy) was done and the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis was later confirmed using PCR technique and DNA sequencing. We review the surgical procedure; molecular diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of pulmonary hydatidosis in sub-Saharan Africa, including Sudan.

Lane 1: DNA extracted from hydatid cyst sample from patient's neck, Lane 2: DNA extracted from hydatid cyst sample from patient's lung, Lane Nc: negative control, Lane PC: E. granulosus (G6) strain DNA (positive control), MW: molecular weight marker
