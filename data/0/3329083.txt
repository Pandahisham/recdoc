Heart failure (HF) and pulmonary hypertension (PHT) are common syndromes with significant morbidity and mortality globally. However, knowledge gap exists in sub-Saharan Africa regarding the impact of one over the other on morbidity and mortality. The present study, which was part of a larger study on HF, aimed at assessing the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcome of PHT among HF patients admitted to a tertiary health center in Kano, Nigeria. The study was cross sectional in design, carried out in the medical wards of Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, Nigeria. Patients admitted with HF were serially recruited and studied after obtaining informed consent. All patients were clinically evaluated, and had baseline investigations including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram (echo), while some of them had assay for N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP). PHT was defined as the presence of mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥25 mmHg, assessed using continuous wave Doppler echo and Chemla formula. A total of 90 patients were studied, but the results presented here are for the 80 patients who had complete data. Fifty-three patients (66.25%) (Group 1) were found to have PHT while the remaining 27 (33.75%) had normal mPAP (Group 2). When the two groups were compared, mPAP for Group 1 was 38.31±12.23 mmHg while that for Group 2 was 16.39±5.48 mmHg (P<0.001). Two patients in Group 1 and 1 patient in Group 2 were smokers. In addition, Group 1 as compared with Group 2 patients had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and larger left atrium and left ventricle (P<0.05). NT-BNP was assessed in only 37 patients and the concentrations were found to be very high; 26 of them in Group 1 (14, 408±11,449) and 11 in Group 2 (12,266±11,497) (P=0.607). Twelve patients had atrial fibrillation, 8 of them in Group 1 and 4 in Group 2. The in-hospital mortality in Group 1 (8 patients=15.09%) was similar to that for Group 2 (4 patients=14.82%) (P=0.626); higher among females than males (8 versus 4 patients, respectively). The chance of discharge from hospital admission or in-hospital mortality was significantly influenced by the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock (odds ratio=0.069; 95% confidence interval=0.017-0.286; P<0.001). The most common cause of HF was hypertensive heart disease seen in 28 patients, 13 of them in Group 1. Fifteen patients had peripartum cardiomyopathy; 13 of them were in Group 1. These were followed by dilated cardiomyopathy in 13 patients, 9 of them in Group 1; rheumatic heart disease in 8 patients, 7 of them in Group 1; ischemic heart disease in 6 patients, all of them in Group 1; corpulmonale in 5 patients, all in Group 1; and effusive pericarditis in 4 patients, all of them in Group 2. PHT is common in admitted HF patients, and is associated with worse parameters for morbidity. However, its influence on in-hospital mortality was not apparent. A follow-up study is needed to assess it effect on long-term mortality.
