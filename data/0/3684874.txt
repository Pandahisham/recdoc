The title compound, Na[Cu(en)2][Cu(CN)4], where en represents ethyl­enedi­amine, NH2CH2CH2NH2, crystallizes as a salt with two distinct cations, Na+ and [CuIIen2]2+, and discrete [CuI(CN)4]3− anions. The anion geometry is tetra­hedral, with angles at the copper atom ranging from 105.0 (1) to 115.4 (1)°. The Cu—C distances are in the range 1.976 (3) to 1.993 (3) Å. The divalent copper atom is coordinated by four N atoms of the two bidentate en ligands in a slightly distorted square-planar geometry. In the crystal, each sodium ion inter­acts with cyanide N atoms of four different anions, with Na—N distances lying in the narrow range of 2.344 (3) to 2.367 (3) Å, and an approximately tetra­hedral arrangement around the sodium ions. The inter­acting sodium ions and [CuI(CN)4]3− anions form a three-dimensional network with channels which contain the [Cu(en)2]2+ cations. One of the chelate rings in the cation shows partial disorder between two different conformations and the C atoms were refined with occupancies in the ratio 0.817 (15):0.183 (15).

The work presented here continues studies on mixed-valence copper cyanide complexes, see: Corfield et al. (2012 ▶). Studies by others on similar complexes include Colacio et al. (2002 ▶) and Kim et al. (2005 ▶). For other results on the specific system CuI,II—CN—en, see: Williams et al. (1972 ▶) and Weiss et al. (2006 ▶). We are aware of only one other detailed crystal structure describing the discrete [Cu(CN)4]3− anion, that reported for K3Cu(CN)4 in Roof et al. (1968 ▶). For molar conductance, see: Angelici (1977 ▶).
