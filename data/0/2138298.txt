EXPERIMENTAL TRANSMISSION OF INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTION IN MICE 

 Immunization of mice by infection or intraperitoneal injection with homotypic A2, heterotypic A0, or recombinant A0A2 virus have differing effects on transmission of influenza A2 virus infection. Immunization by infection with A2 virus resulted in refractoriness to reinfection either by artificial aerosols or by exposure to infected cage-mates. Immunization by inoculation with inactivated A2 virus vaccine resulted in a decreased susceptibility to transmitted infection in immunized contacts, but following A2 virus challenge, transmission of infection by immunized infectors was not altered. Immunization by infection with influenza A0 virus or recombinant A0A2 virus resulted in a decreased susceptibility to transmitted A2 virus infection in immunized contacts, and to decreased transmission after A2 virus infection in immunized infector mice. These differing effects on transmission of infection are attributed to differences in specific local immunologic responses following the various immunization procedures.
