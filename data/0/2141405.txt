THE VALIDITY OF TALBOT'S LAW FOR THE EYE OF THE HONEY BEE

 By presenting to bees two illuminated fields, equal in brightness, of which one is flickering and the other stationary we find that on account of the bee's positive phototropic response equal numbers of bees travel to both fields. We thus can assume that Talbot's law is valid for the eye of the bee.
