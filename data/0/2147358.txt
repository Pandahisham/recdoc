CHARACTERISTICS OF COLLODION MEMBRANES FOR ULTRAFILTRATION

 An apparatus for the production of graded collodion membranes is described. The theoretical considerations of calibration are discussed in relation to the demonstrable structure and statistical characteristics of the membranes. A new definition of an "end-point" is suggested.
