Spontaneous Vacuolar Degeneration of the Thyroid Follicular Epithelium in          Cynomolgus Monkeys

Vacuolar degeneration of the thyroid follicular epithelium was observed in two untreated          female cynomolgus monkeys assigned to control groups. In light microscopy, large vacuoles          containing a homogenous substance occupied the basal region of the epithelium, and the          nuclei had shifted toward the apical region. The vacuoles showed negative reactions to PAS          and thyroglobulin. Electron microscopic observation revealed dilatation of the rough          endoplasmic reticulum corresponding to the vacuoles. The plasma TSH, T3 and T4 levels          determined for the samples kept frozen were within the normal ranges, suggesting that the          thyroid function was kept intact. 

Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) are widely used in preclinical      toxicology studies due to their phylogenic relationship to humans. Since a limited number of      animals are used in nonrodent toxicity studies, it is difficult to distinguish      test-compound-related lesions from spontaneously occurring changes. A vacuolar change in      thyroid follicular cells is known to be one of the spontaneous changes in Wistar Hannover      GALAS rats1–3, and it has been observed by      electron microscopically, as dilatation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (r-ER).      Furthermore, similar findings have been reported in mice4, rats5,6 and        humans7,8 with congenital goitar and      hypothyroidism. To the best of our knowledge, little information is available on naturally      occurring lesions of the thyroid gland in nonhuman primates. In histopathological examinations      of cynomolgus monkeys in toxicity studies, severe vacuolar degeneration of the thyroid      follicular epithelium was observed in 2 out of 182 females (1.01%) and 0 out of 186 males      assigned to control groups. This case report describes histopathological, immunohistochemical      and electronmicroscopic characteristics of the vacuolar changes in the thyroid follicular      epithelial cells. Further hormonal determination was also conducted on one of these      animals.

All animals were obtained from the Primate Quality Control Center, Ina Research Philippines,      Inc., and were 2–3 yrs old at necropsy. The animals were necropsied routinely after      exsanguination under anesthesia by intravenous injection of pentobarbital. The first (Case 1,      age: 2 yrs) of the two female monkeys was treated subcutaneously with a vehicle (saline) for 2      weeks, and the second monkey (Case 2, age: 2 yrs) was treated orally with a vehicle, a mixture      of 0.2 w/v% polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 60 (HCO-60) and 0.5 w/v% sodium      carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), for 13 weeks. The thyroid glands and other organs were fixed in      10% neutral-buffered formalin and processed routinely into histological sections. Thyroid      sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and an      immunohistochemical marker for determination of thyroglobulin (rabbit anti-human thyroglobulin      polyclonal antibody, Dako Japan Inc.) by the peroxidase-labeled polymer method using an      EnVision kit (Dako Japan Inc.). For electronmicroscopic examination of these animals, several      tissue masses were dissected from the formalin-fixed thyroid glands. Then they were refixed      with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide, embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned and      stained with 1% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. In one of these two animals (Case 2) and in 4      intact animals (age: 2 yrs) in the control group of the same toxicity study, the thyroid      stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels in plasma      were determined in samples obtained at week 7 and 13 of the treatment period using a      chemiluminescent immunoassay kit (Chemilumi ACS-TSH III, T3 and T4, Siemens Medical Solutions      Diagnostics, Inc.). The studies were conducted in compliance with the “Partial Amendments to      the Law for the Humane Treatment and Management of Animals (Law No. 68, Jun. 22, 2005, Japan)”      and the “Guidance for Animal Care and Use” of Ina Research Inc. and in accordance with      protocols reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Ina Research      Inc., which is fully accredited by AAALAC International (Accredited Unit No. 001107).
In the two monkeys, no macroscopic abnormalities in the thyroid glands were observed at      necropsy, and the organ weights were within the normal range (Table 1). In light microscopy, a large vacuole was observed at the      basal region of each follicular epithelial cell and was compressing the nuclei toward the      apical region. As a result, the nuclei were characteristically located in the apical region      adjacent to the follicular lumina (Fig. 1). An      homogeneous substance was observed in the vacuoles, and the substance showed negative      reactions to PAS (Fig. 2) and anti-thyroglobulin      immunostaining (Fig. 3). Electron microscopy      revealed that the dilatation of the r-ER corresponded to the vacuoles observed in light      microscopy (Fig. 4). The plasma levels of TSH, T3      and T4 in the monkey with thyroid changes were not apparently different from the other control      values (Table 2). In addition, no abnormalities      were seen macroscopically or microscopically in any other organs including the pituitary      glands of these two females.
Large vacuoles at the basal region have been reported in female Fisher 344 rats5 and Wistar Hannover GALAS rats of both        sexes1–3. The vacuolar degeneration      reported here was very similar to the findings that vacuoles reacted negatively to PAS and      thyroglobulin in the reported rat cases1,5.      On the other hand, dilatation of r-ER in the follicular epithelium has been reported in      animals with genetic hypothyroidism2–4,6,9.      However, this differed from the reports that vacuoles reacted positively to thyroglobulin in      rats with hypothyroidism2,3. A large amount      of r-ER is present at the basal region of the follicular epithelium and synthesizes      thyroglobulin. Dilatation of the r-ER might be the process through which thyroid hormone      synthesis or secretion was affected. However, the plasma TSH, T3 and T4 levels in the monkeys      were within the normal ranges in the present study. Furthermore, no abnormalities were seen in      blood biochemistry or organ and body weights. The animals were found to be healthy in clinical      observations. From these results, it is suggested that the function of the thyroid glands with      vacuolar degeneration was maintained to a degree that still allowed the animals to remain in a      healthy condition. It is uncertain whether vacuolar degeneration is part of a process leading      to further cell lesion or merely a morphological change remaining in a stable state. It is      also unknown whether the change originated genetically or was brought about by other      causes.
We believe this case report provides useful information for the practice of histopathology in      toxicity studies. It is important to gain a wide knowledge of spontaneous lesions in the      monkey in order to make a correct toxic assessment when animals randomly assigned to drug      treatment groups exhibit marked changes.
