LONG-LASTING LITHIUM NEUROTOXICITY IN AN ADOLESECENT

Acute lithium intoxication is well known. A case of long tasting lithium neurotoxicity in an adolescent male is reported, who showed signs of cerebellar as well as brain stem involvement. Persistent lithium neurotoxicity is discussed and the recommendation made that this condition be considered irreversible only if no substantial recovery occurs in the first six months.
