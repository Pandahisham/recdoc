Formation of mutagens by heating foods and model systems.

We have demonstrated that the pyrolysis products of amino acids and proteins in model systems are mutagenic. The mutagenic principles in the pyrolyzates of amino acids have been isolated and identified by Sugimura et al. We have isolated and identified amino-alpha-carbolines from pyrolyzed soybean globulin as mutagens. The yield of mutagens by the heating of food constituents is changed by the heating method. Effects of heating methods on the yield of amino-alpha-carbolines were studied in a series of experiments, and the results are shown in this paper. Additionally, it has been shown that by the heating of creatine-sugar mixtures imidazoquinoline or quinoxaline mutagens are formed.
