Taxonomic Revision of Hispaniola Tiger Beetles in the GenusBrasiella Rivalier 1954 (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Cicindelinae)

Academic editor: T. Erwin
The Brasiella tiger beetle fauna on Hispaniola, the second largest island of the Greater Antilles, has more species diversity than currently recognized as all populations previously have been assigned to the insular endemic Brasiella dominicana (Mandl). A comparative study of adult morphology, particularly male genitalic and female abdominal characters, for available Brasiella specimens from populations on Hispaniola, proposes eight additional new species also endemic to this island. Except for three sympatric species in the Sierra de Baoruco in southern Dominican Republic occurring in different habitats, all the Brasiella on Hispaniola appear to be allopatric. Most species occur in the major mountainous regions of Hispaniola. Two species, however, are known only from river floodplains in the southern coastal plain of the Dominican Republic. Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) and Brasiella ocoa, new species, occur along river floodplains emanating from the eastern end of the Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic. Two new Brasiella species, Brasiella bellorum, and Brasiella philipi, occur in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, the former species from central portions, and the latter species from north slopes of this mountain range, respectively. Three new Brasiella species, Brasiella rawlinsi, Brasiella iviei, and Brasiella youngi, are isolated in the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic, where each occupies a different habitat along an altitudinal gradient. The two new Brasiella species in Haiti are Brasiella darlingtoniana, in the Massif de la Selle, and Brasiella davidsoni, in the Massif de la Hotte. All nine Brasiella species on Hispaniola, along with Brasiella viridicollis (Dejean) and its two subspecies on Cuba, belong to the viridicollis species group of the genus Brasiella based on criteria presented in earlier published phylogenetic studies of Brazilian and West Indian tiger beetles. The subspecies Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi (Kippenhan, Ivie and Hopp) may represent a distinct species within this species group, whereas removal of Brasiella wickhami (W. Horn) from this species group seems warranted based on evidence presented. A general overview of species relationships for the Brasiella on Hispaniola are discussed, along with the current and ancestral geographic distributions of the Brasiella viridicollis species group in the West Indies.

A suite of synapomorphic characters, especially of the male genitalia, not found in related Western Hemisphere Cicindelinae taxa, firmly establishes the distinctiveness of the species classified as Brasiella Rivalier, 1954 (Rivalier 1954, 1955). This mostly Neotropical taxonomic grouping of small (<7.5 mm), primarily cursorial, tiger beetles received generic status in the latest and most comprehensive treatises of the Geadephaga of the world (Lorenz 2005), and of the Western Hemisphere Carabidoidea (Erwin and Pearson 2008).
Prior to this revision, all populations on Hispaniola had been assigned to the insular endemic Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) (Freitag 1992). The author had the opportunity during the last decade to examine Brasiella collected by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History staff from several widely separated populations across Hispaniola, as well as, Brasiella dominicana type specimens. These, and other available specimens of Brasiella collected from other parts of Hispaniola, exhibited many external differences from the holotype and paratypes of Brasiella dominicana. Adults differed superficially in body size and color, as well as, the extent and shape of elytral markings. This suggested that Hispaniola might possess more Brasiella species diversity than previously recognized.
Consequently, the possibility of additional Brasiella on Hispaniola was investigated more rigorously with a comparative morphological study of available Brasiella specimens from populations throughout Hispaniola. Within each population, a small sample of specimens was examined to characterize and document adult external structures for both sexes when available. Male genitalic structures, particularly those within the aedeagus inner sac, and female abdominal structures, also provided useful characters for distinguishing among Brasiella populations on Hispaniola. Furthermore, the characteristics of these structures provided the basis for establishing the proposed concepts of the Brasiella specieson Hispaniola. The results of these investigations are presented in this taxonomic revision.
This taxonomic revision of the Brasiella species on Hispaniola is organized by sections to provide: 1) taxonomic history; 2) sources of study specimens; 3) explanation of selective external adult structures, and internal male genitalic structures; 4) imaging methods for adults and male genitalia; 5) imaging methods for geographic distributions; 6) available ecological information and habitat imaging; 7) a dichotomous species key to identify adults; 8) detailed species accounts; 9) species relationships within the Brasiella viridicollis species group.
The detailed accounts for the Brasiella species on Hispaniola are arranged alphabetically and each includes: 1) label data from the types and other examined specimens; 2) type depositories; 3) type locality and notes on the type locality; 4) diagnostic characters for distinguishing the taxon from other taxa; 5) detailed redescription of previously known species or description of new species revealed by this revision; 6) ecological information on adult habitat and activity period, and associated tiger beetle species; 7) geographic distribution data listed and related to Hispaniola map; 8) etymology for new species; 9) remarks about comparisons with related species.
A phylogenetic analysis of Brasiella species on Hispaniola is beyond the scope of the present revision. However, remarks about species relationships suggested from the author's observations and experience studying the Brasiella species on Hispaniola are presented for each species treated in this revision. A general discussion of species relationships, based on the latest published phylogenetic treatment of Brasiella, follows the species accounts. Emphasis is placed on the composition of the Brasiella virdicollis species group, as well as, its current and ancestral geographic distributions in the West Indies. Such a discussion is considered relevant for developing future studies to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Hispaniola Brasiella species treated in this revision relative to other Western Hemisphere Brasiella.
Philip J. Darlington, Jr., collected the first Brasiella specimens in small series on Hispaniola during his Museum of Comparative Zoology expeditions to Haiti in 1934 and the Dominican Republic in 1938. At least one specimen from the 1934 Haitian collection was determined by Walther Horn, the world authority among Cicindelidae taxonomists of the early 20th Century, to be the widespread Neotropical Cicindela argentata Fabricius 1801. It appears that the specimens from the 1938 Dominican Republic collection were not sent to Horn because catalogers only listed this species from Haiti when considering the distribution of Cicindela argentata Fabricius (Blackwelder 1944) or later as Brasiella argentata (Fabricius)(Erwin and Sims 1984). Indeed, even (Rivalier (1954, 1955), who established the generic concept of Brasiella based on Cicindela argentata Fabricius as its type species, did not alter this view about more than one species on Hispaniola.
The prevailing view about the Hispaniolan Brasiella changed, however, when Karl Mandl described Cicindela (Brasiella) dominicana 1983 based on specimens collected in 1971 by J. Klapperich (Mandl 1983). Comparative study of a paratypic male specimen of this new species, with those Darlington had collected earlier, led Freitag (1992) to conclude that all the Hispaniola specimens he examined represented one insular endemic species, Cicindela (Brasiella) dominicana Mandl.
Since that publication, the author of this revision has had the opportunity to examine large numbers of Brasiella specimens collected at several localities on Hispaniola from 1988 to 2008. Specimens were collected as follows: large series at sites in Pedernales Province, Dominican Republic by Michael A. Ivie, WIBP; several large series at sites in Pedernales and La Vega Provinces in the Dominican Republic and DÃ©partement du l'Sud, Haiti, by John E. Rawlins and Robert L. Davidson, CMNH; a small series from Santiago Province, Dominican Republic, by Brian Farrell, MCZH; small series from Peravia and La Vega Provinces, Dominican Republic, by David Brzoska. All of Darlington's Brasiella specimens deposited at MCZH and at NMNH were also examined. Paratypes of Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) at CMNH were examined, and the holotype and other paratypes of Brasiella dominicana were borrowed from NHMW.
This taxonomic revision was fostered by the availability of Brasiella specimens, including the holotype and paratypes of Brasiella dominicana (Mandl), from the various museums and private collections listed below under Specimen Depositories. All specimens examined are referenced with an exclamation (!). Label information is quoted in the exact format of spelling, punctuation and spacing as it appears on the labels; each label line separated by a slash between spaces ( / ); each label separated by a semicolon. The format and color used for printing each label and the label paper color are indicated in brackets. A Carnegie Museum Specimen Number label [CMNH-xxx,xxx], created by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History staff, has been affixed to all types deposited at CMNH and this unique number resides in a database at this museum. Likewise, unique numbers and/or bar codes, if previously assigned, are indicated for those type specimens deposited in other museums and collections.
The Brasiella specimens available for study were borrowed from, or deposited with, the museums and individuals listed below, and elsewhere in the revision, using accepted abbreviations (Arnett et al. 1993) or those created here for reference.

Obvious external morphological differences exhibited by specimens from different populations were utilized as the initial basis for species recognition. However, the decision about the distinctiveness of each species ultimately involved internal characters of the male genitalia, particularly the aedeagus inner sac or intromittent organ. Female external abdominal characters were utilized secondarily to support the decisions provided by the male genitalia.
The external structures presented below under Systematics for the key couplets to identify the species, and in their individual Species Accounts, are based on recognition of selected sclerites and appendages common to all Coleoptera. Most statements that characterize these external structures are obvious and apparent to those familiar with the study of tiger beetles; however, certain external structures typical of tiger beetles in general, and of Brasiella in particular, require clarification and explanation as applied specifically to this revision.
Body Size. In the descriptions that accompany each species, a range in body size within that species, from the largest to the smallest specimens available for study, is shown for comparison among species. Body size is presented to the nearest 0.1 mm for body length, measured dorsally from the frons of the head to the posterior tip of the elytra, and elytra width, measured dorsally across the anterior humeral angles of the elytra through the middle of the scutellum. Body length measurements reflect the position of the body when the hypognathus head is in the normal feeding position and the labrum is nearly vertical. Elytra width measurements were obtained at the most stable position on the elytra although the body is widest at the outer apical angle of the elytra. However, because the elytral suture often becomes widely separated at the apex in dried specimens, width measurements across that part of the elytra would be erroneously larger. Body size measurements were obtained with an ocular micrometer calibrated at 10 X magnification.
Labrum Dimensions. The labrum is a conspicuous structure in tiger beetles and has been characterized in the descriptions for most species published in the taxonomic literature for this group. For comparison of this structure among the Brasiella described in this revision, the dimensions of the labrum are presented as a width to length ratio for the holotype male, and a similar ratio for the known allotype female, of each species. Labral width is the transverse dimension, whereas, labral length is the longitudinal one along the body axis. The measurements of width and length were taken on the longest dimensions of the labrum.
Eye Size. The eye size of Brasiella species on Hispaniola is presented in this revision as a means for not only distinguishing between the sexes of certain species, but also between some of the species themselves. Undoubtedly, eye size provides a species specific means to acquire visual cues for mating and prey selection, as well as predator avoidance, under the prevailing light conditions within the habitat used by each particular species. Most diurnal tiger beetle species have relatively large eyes to acquire these visual cues. However, their eyes may be âprominentâ in the dorsal dimension or âbulgingâ in the lateral dimension or have characteristics of both conditions.
The first of the two conditions of eye size used in this revision is based on the proportion of the eye surfaces dorsally above the vertex of the head. View a specimen anteriorly such that the top of the vertex between the eyes is nearly parallel to the line of sight of the viewer and the point of insertion of the posterior supraorbital setae is just visible at the eye top. Eyes are considered âprominentâ if a majority of the eye surface extends above a line drawn across the inner anterior angle of each eye just below the point of insertion of the anterior supraorbital setae. The second condition of eye size is based on the proportion of the eye surfaces laterally beyond the vertex of the head. View a specimen dorsally and assess the degree of curvature of the outline of the eyes. Eyes are considered âbulgingâ if the eye surface occupies a larger arc area than that occupied by the vertex as defined by arc length of the curved eye boundary. For the Brasiella species on Hispaniola, prominent eyes are the normal condition exhibited by most species, whereas bulging eyes exist only for a few species.
Coupling Sulcus. The coupling sulcus is a depression, groove, pit or cavity, or a combination of these, on the female mesepisterna that receives the male mandibles during copulation. This structure was described by Freitag (1974) as an important secondary sexual mechanism for mate selection within a species. Because the characteristics of the coupling sulcus are distinctive and fairly consistent on females within a species, it can be used to differentiate closely related species and provides an additional aid to species identification. The coupling sulcus (CS) has been indicated on the anterior lateral images of adult females presented in the figures accompanying this revision for all species except one whose female is unknown.
Abdominal Structures. Some females of the genus Brasiella possess abdominal structures visible on the exposed ventral surfaces of the terminal sterna that are unique within Western Hemisphere Cicindelinae. Freitag and Barnes (1989) first noted one of these unusual abdominal characters, which they termed an âunpigmented, bell-shaped spotâ, on the female 5th sternum medially along its posterior margin. The color of the integument in Cicindelinae, however, is not derived from pigmentation, but rather, interference reflection of light from different epicuticular layers formed during sclerotization of the integument (Schultz and Rankin 1985a, 1985b). So rather than being unpigmented, this structure is actually membranous, unsclerotized cuticle. This transverse band on the female 5th sternum in this revision is referred to as a membranous wedge (MW). Anterior to this membranous wedge on the same sternum lies a second structure, a membranous longitudinal median band (MB). Both membranous structures are developed to various degrees in most Brasiella species on Hispaniola for which the female is known. Transverse wrinkles in the integument also are present medially on the female 6th sternum of certain Brasiella species on Hispaniola. In addition, a small mediolateral gibbosity (LG) situated on each side of the female 6th sternum is present in all Brasiella species on Hispaniola for which the female is known. These structures on the female 5th and 6th sternum are labelled on the images presented in the figures accompanying this revision for all species except one whose female is unknown.
Male genitalia are the only internal structures discussed in this revision. Within the key couplets to species identification, and in the individual species accounts, selected sclerites very specific to Brasiella are referenced. Knowledge of these sclerites requires an explanation of each to understand their characteristics and help ensure their recognition. In addition to the shape and size of each sclerite, its arrangement relative to other sclerites within the aedeagus inner sac is important for comparison among species. Application of this knowledge to species identification requires careful dissection of male specimens and preparation of their genitalia to maintain the arrangement of the aedeagus inner sac sclerites.
The orientation of the male genitalia and aedeagus inner sac, as presented in this revision, is referenced based on the genitalia positioning within the abdomen. Male genitalia are normally found in this location when specimens are killed during collecting and later pinned or point-mounted for study. For an interpretation of these structures during mating, refer to Freitag et al. (1985) and the detailed explanation in Acciavatti and Pearson (1989).
Male Genitalia. (Rivalier (1954, 1955) characterized the genus Brasiella and distinguished species he studied based on distinctive differences exhibited by structures of the male genitalia. Ultimate decisions regarding distinctiveness of species in the present revision are based on the form of the male genitalia, especially the hooked tip at the aedeagus apex, and the degree of differentiation of the four internal sclerites and associated spine fields within the male aedeagus inner sac. These sclerites and spine fields are defined below, and have been indicated by their codes on images of the male aedeagus inner sac presented for all species in the figures accompanying this revision.
The four distinctive sclerites within the inner sac of the aedeagus that characterize Brasiella were named and defined by (Rivalier (1954, 1955). Rivalier's name for each of these structures has been translated here into English with his original French terminology shown in brackets. Each sclerite within the aedeagus inner sac is defined along with information about the range of its variation evident in Hispaniola Brasiella species, and its location relative to other inner sac sclerites and the genitalia itself. The code assigned here to each sclerite, and other associated structures, are shown in the images for the holotype male of each species as presented in the figures:
Arched piece [lapiÃ¨ce arciforme] (AP): narrow, obliquely oriented and long to broad, obliquely oriented and short; thinnest sclerite; densely sclerotized along entire length; lies dorsally across other sclerites; not visible externally.
Shield [un bouclier] (SH): distinct, single apex with rounded tip to distinct, single apex with tapering tip; smallest sclerite; not densely sclerotized; occupies lower end of genital opening; entire distal end distinctly visible externally.
Large tooth [la grande dent] (LT): elongate with a pointed apex to broad with a rounded apex; most bulky sclerite; densely sclerotized except at distal end; extended basally into a densely sclerotized root; not visible externally.
Stylet [le stylet] (ST): long, broad and straight with pointed tip to long, broad and bent with recurved or hooked tip; longest sclerite; not densely sclerotized; occupies upper end of genital opening; tip visible externally.
Additional structures within the inner sac were characterized as follows:
Spine Fields (SF): several patches of sclerotized setae of various sizes and shapes, the one within the aedeagus neck being the one most obvious and diagnostic; others are positioned inside the genital opening on either side of it.
Dark Fields (DF): darkened, membranous areas near Root of Large Tooth.
Root (RT): densely sclerotized, curved and forked, basal extension of Large Tooth.
Male Genitalia Preparation. A few adult males, representative of the different populations of Brasiella available from Hispaniola, were each prepared for removal of the genitalia by soaking the entire specimen in a weak solution of ammonia for a day or two. The aedeagus could then be easily pulled out or removed from each relaxed abdomen, and through gentle squeezing with fine forceps, the four sclerites and associated setal brushes within its inner sac could be extruded for examination and imaging. For future reference as vouchers, the aedeagus of each sampled specimen has been stored in glycerin in a microvial and this pinned underneath the specimen. These specimens have been deposited with the museum or in the collections shown above under the Specimen Depositories utilized for this revision.
Adult habitus images of the holotypes, allotypes, and certain paratypes of the Brasiella species described and presented in this revision are presented as Figs 1â17, as well as, close-ups of selected body regions, and male genitalic structures. These images not only help to illustrate the structures, but also provide a means for comparing characters among the species to facilitate their recognition.
Images of adults of each sex from various aspects were obtained with a JVC 3CCD Digital Camera, Model KY-F74U, through a Leica M420 APO, Zoom 1:6, stereomicroscope equipped with Syncroscopy Auto-Montage Pro Version 5.01.005 2004 software. Standard fiber optics lights were used to illuminate all specimens imaged with the light diffused by white translucent surfaces.
Male genitalic and aedeagal images were obtained using a Nikon CoolPix L5, 7.2 megapixel, 5 X zoom, digital camera through a Bausch and Lomb zoom stereomicroscope. To facilitate imaging of the male genitalia and the aedeagus with its extruded inner sac sclerites, these structures were placed in glycerin within the well of a glass slide. The glass slide was suspended above neutral gray photographic paper. Thus suspended, the aedeagus was illuminated by two fiber optics lights adjusted from various angles to provide both back lighting and minimize glare.
All images were cropped and photo enhanced with standard photo editor software on a personal computer. The images illustrate the general body form, shape and color of structures, elytral markings, and certain specific morphological characters discussed in the key and descriptions. A 1 mm scale line was added to each enhanced image to indicate the relative size of comparable morphological structures among species.
For each Brasiella species on Hispaniola, its type locality and other localities are presented on the 30 m resolution, digital, topographic map shown as Fig. 22. This map was generated from radar-imaged elevation data on a near-global scale obtained through the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) on board the Space Shuttle Endeavor in February 2000. The map image is in the public domain and available through the Internet. No political boundaries are shown on the map, as these were deemed unnecessary for the purposes of depicting the known distribution of each species in relation to the various mountainous areas on Hispaniola. The legend accompanying Fig. 22 provides a descriptive name for the color-coded circle(s) for each Brasiella species to indicate the type locality and/or other localities within either the Dominican Republic Province or Haiti DÃ©partement, along with the geographic feature associated with the type locality.
The known ecological information concerning the adult habitat and activity period for the species treated in this revision come mostly from label data. This has been augmented by field collection notes provided by Robert L. Davidson, who collected several of the new Brasiella species, and from John E. Rawlins, who led the CMNH Expeditions to the Dominican Republic from 1987 through 2003, and to Haiti in 1995. David W. Brzoska provided information on the habitat and associated tiger beetle species for the Brasiella specimens he collected in the Dominican Republic in 2005.
Woodruff (2004) presented detailed information about the habitats in the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic, thereby providing a valuable insight into the ecological settings for several sympatric Brasiella in this mountain range. He considered the Sierra de Baoruco to be an area of high endemism for Coleoptera because it lies on what has been referred to as the South Paleoisland of Hispaniola. Woodruff (2004) provided a general account of the geological evidence about Paleoisland concepts for Hispaniola to explain the zoogeography of Phyllophaga species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae) on this island. For further reading on the geologic history of Hispaniola, refer to his publication (Woodruff 2004) as a discussion of these concepts is beyond the scope of this revision.
An indication of the habitat for each Brasiella species on Hispaniola is presented as oblique aerial images obtained from Google EarthÂ©. Ground level habitat images also are presented for certain of these species obtained as geotagged images from either websites, http://acme.mapper.com, and http://creativecommons.org, using http://flickr.com by YahooÂ©, or from scanned slides and images taken by John E. Rawlins during the CMNH expeditions to the Dominican Republic. Figs 18 to 21 depict these habitats.

This species occurs on the clay slopes of road cuts and adjacent dirt roads within dense secondary evergreen and broadleaf forests with pines on slopes in the central parts of the Cordillera Central between 915 to 1730 m elevations. At the type locality, adults and larvae of this species were present and abundant in May when Robert L. Davidson collected the large type series (Figs 18B-18D). The two adults taken the previous November at the type locality may not truly represent how abundant this species can be at that time year when less avid collectors visited the type locality. However, this species may actually be less abundant in November than earlier in May. Indeed, David W. Brzoska, who is an accomplished tiger beetle collector, was only able to collect 11 specimens of Brasiella bellorum in November at a locality at 1538 m only about 5 km away from the type locality. The specimens he collected were found near wet areas around puddles on exposed red clay along a grassy dirt road. Thus, adult activity for Brasiella bellorum spans seven months with adults more abundant in May than later in August and November.

This Latinized plural eponym, genitive case, based on the family name of Ross T. Bell honors both Ross and his wife, Joyce, for their entomological careers and contributions as world authorities on the Rhysodidae. Ross and Joyce have been friends, colleagues, and mentors to a multitude of entomologists and taxonomists specializing in Carabidae. Both Ross and Joyce Bell were honorees of the Bell Fest Symposium held in Burlington, Vermont, June 2010, and this Festschrift is dedicated to them.
Brasiella bellorum, new species, and Brasiella philipi, new species, both occur in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, the former species in the central areas and the latter species on the northern slopes of this mountain range. The elytral pattern of both species are very similar and only differ in the form of the elytral lunules; narrowed and broken in Brasiella bellorum, but wide and more developed in Brasiella philipi, especially in the shape of the hook at the discal end of the middle band. Despite this superficial similarity, there seems little doubt that these two species are distinctive based on differences in the form of the sclerites within the aedeagus of males for each species. A comparison of the other morphological characters presented in the key and the descriptions for each species further support their distinctiveness. The geographic range of both these species, although apparently allopatric based on the limited collection data currently available, may be found to coincide more with additional collecting in the Cordillera Central. Despite their distinctiveness as separate species and apparent allopatry, it is interesting to note that these two species seem to occupy a similar habitat type in these mountains with adults of both species active during the same summer months. Their geographic distributions in close proximity to each other in similar high elevation habitats suggest a common lineage.

HAITI: DÃ©partement du l'Ouest, Massif de la Selle, Highway 101 below Parc de La Visite, 18Â°20'45" N, 72Â°17'19" W, 1755 m. Aerial view in Fig. 18E.
Notes on Type Locality. The type locality, herein established at the above coordinates, was implied from the type labels because the actual location where Darlington collected this new species is uncertain; his label data only generalized his collecting along the route he took during his expedition to Haiti. La Visite is a National Park, Parc de La Visite, located along Highway 101 in a relatively flat, high elevation area along this highway at 6000 feet in the Massif de la Selle south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. However, Darlington almost certainly did not collect this new species within La Visite National Park based on the discussion presented below under Ecology. In consideration of that information, the type locality for this species is more precisely established above using Google EarthÂ©. The type locality was chosen to be a site adjoining La Visite slightly to the north (Fig. 18F) with the coordinates shown above.

The exact locality, and hence the habitat, where Darlington collected this new species is uncertain. Darlington's labels on his 1934-collecting trip to the Massif de la Selle indicate that he first collected south of Port-au-Prince from âKenskoff [Kenscoff] to La Visite and vicinityâ and then later on his return trip along an âauto roadâ from Furcy to Kenskoff [Kenscoff]. The auto road he took is most likely the same as current Highway 101 that traverses the Massif de la Selle from Port-au-Prince to near the southern coast of Haiti. Suitable habitats where Darlington collected likely occurred along this road at elevations of roughly 5000 feet. An image from Google EarthÂ© (Fig. 18E), and a geotagged image from http://flickr.com taken in early 2010 along Highway 101 below its summit in the vicinity of Parc de La Visite (Fig. 18F), both show an unimproved rocky road cut into a steep slope with sparse vegetation. The road banks and roadway appear eroded and traversed mostly on foot by local inhabitants. In Parc de La Visite itself, this highway reaches 6000 feet elevations, becomes much more level, and runs through stands of Pinus occidentalis Swartz with grassy openings of Andropogon sp. within the pine forest (Fig. 18E). Darlington (1935) notes that his base camp for collecting at La Visite was in âtall pine forest at 6,000 feet beside the RiviÃ¨re Chotardâ [currently known as Cascade de Seguin]. However, he states that his collecting within the pine stands produced no carabids. Thus, the habitat where Darlington collected this new species is likely situated along the road he took to reach Parc de La Visite, but at a lower elevation than where he camped. The site in Fig. 18F with eroded clay banks along Highway 101 at about 1755 m (5760 ft) has been selected as the type locality for this new species. The only known specimens of this new species were collected during September.
Fig. 22. HAITI: DÃ©partement du l'Ouest, Massif de la Selle. Kenskoff [Kenscoff], Furcy, and La Visite are localities on the labels of the type specimens collected by P.J. Darlington in 1934. This species likely occurs in suitable habitats from Kenscoff to the northwestern boundary of Parc de La Visite along Highway 101. This highway from Furcy southward to La Visite traverses a series of long ridges at about 5000 feet elevation before rising abruptly to 6000 feet where it crosses over to the southern slopes of the Massif de la Selle.
This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of the late Philip J. Darlington, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The species name acknowledges his contributions as the preeminent American carabidologist during the Mid-20th Century. During his 1934 expedition to Haiti, Darlington was the first coleopterist to collect in the Massif de la Selle, the highest mountains in Haiti. Darlington collected the types of this new species along the autoroute taken by his expedition across the Massif de la Selle in the vicinity of La Visite, now designated as Parc de La Visite, a National Park in this southeastern Haitian mountain range.
This species is most closely related to Brasiella davidsoni from the Massif de la Hotte on the Tiburon Peninsula of western Haiti ca. 185 km to the west of the Massif de la Selle. The four typical sclerites within the inner sac of the aedeagus that characterize Brasiella are very similar for both species especially the unusual form of the recurved terminal tip of the stylet, although this differs in the degree of its curvature for each species. Females of both species possess similar small, paired mediolateral gibbosities on the 6th abdominal sternum. Moreover, the elytral markings of both species are quite similar in pattern with only the extremities of the humeral lunule evident; this marking on all specimens examined consistently was divided into a humeral mark and a discal spot variously reduced or enlarged depending on the specimen. Additionally, the middle lunule always terminates near the suture in a broad hook never anteriorly recurved. However, the distinctiveness of these two species is confirmed by differences between the two in the size of the recurved aedeagus apex of males, as well as, differences in the extent of development of the membranous longitudinal median band and membranous wedge on the 5th abdominal sternum of females.

Robert L. Davidson informed the author that this new species, named in his honor, was extremely abundant at the type locality when he and other CMNH staff collected there in early September. This new species was collected along dirt roads and trails through fields and disturbed forests at 1405 m on the south slope of Morne Formon in the Massif de la Hotte (Fig. 19A). Darlington's specimen labels indicate he collected this new species at about the same elevation around the paratype locality of Desbarriere in mid-October. Darlington (1935) during his Haitian Expedition traversed treacherous terrain at Desbarriere where vegetation covered eroded limestone slopes on the north side of the Massif de la Hotte. From the collection data available, it appears that adults of this new species are active during the latter part of the year in September and October.

This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of Robert L. Davidson, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Robert is a recognized taxonomic expert on Carabidae and, for several decades, has been my mentor for studying these beetles and a close friend. I am honored to name this species for him, not only because he collected this new species, but also for his outstanding efforts to acquire specimens of several other new Brasiella species described in this revision. Although Philip J. Darlington collected specimens of this new species in the Massif de la Hotte during his 1934 expedition to Haiti, earlier workers did not consider these to be distinct from either Brasiella argentata (Fabricius) or Brasiella dominicana (Mandl). The conspecificity of the Darlington specimens with Brasiella davidsoni was established in this revision. The Darlington specimens fall within the range of variation exhibited by this new species as documented by the large series of specimens collected by Robert L. Davidson and CMNH colleagues.
This species appears closely related to Brasiella darlingtoniana from the Massif de la Selle situated farther eastward in central Haiti (refer to discussion under that species) because of the suite of unique synapomorhic characters the two share that are not found in other Brasiella on Hispaniola. The shape and form of the male aedeagus and the four typical sclerites within the inner sac of the aedeagus that characterize Brasiella are the most highly modified in this species compared to others on Hispaniola. Among these modifications, the aedeagus neck is broadly and distinctly recurved with an apex terminating in an extremely short, blunt end. Furthermore, the inner sac of the male genitalia has a stylet with a distinctively hooked terminal tip. For females, the membranous transverse wedge and longitudinal median band on the 5th abdominal sternum, fully or partially developed in the other Brasiella species on Hispaniola, are completely absent. These modified morphological characters of this species, unique among the Brasiella on Hispaniola, were not previously considered in earlier phylogenetic analyses (Freitag and Barnes 1989). Because of this omission, it is unclear how to interpret their conclusions about phylogeny within the Brasiella viridicollis Dejean species group, a concept now greatly expanded by the addition of numerous species described in this revision. Thus, the relationship of Brasiella davidsoni to the other Brasiella in the Dominican Republic remains uncertain. Loss or modification of several characters by Brasiella davidsoni of homologous characters found in related species implies isolation for a long period of time leading to these character divergences.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Peravia Province, Bani, 18Â°16'51" N, 70Â°19'28" W at 59 m. Aerial view in Fig. 19B.
The coordinates shown above were obtained from GoogleÂ© and hereby establish the type locality of this species as inferred from the locality data on the types and from the original description. Bani is a town situated on the coastal plain where the Cordillera Central terminate along the southcentral coast of the Dominican Republic. Exactly where the type series for this species originated previously has been uncertain as Mandl did not present a specific locality other than Bani nor have any other specimens of this species been collected subsequent to the original type series. However, refer to the discussion under its Ecology below for circumstantial evidence as to the most likely collection site to help establish the type locality for this species at the coordinates shown above.

As Mandl (1983) was not specific about the exact site where this species was collected, its habitat is uncertain. Nonetheless, the habitat of Brasiella dominicana can be inferred from its association with another tiger beetle, Cicindela (Plectographa) schaefferi W. Horn 1903. Both species were collected by Klapperich on the same dates at Bani based on the information presented in Mandl's publication and specimens examined at CMNH. Cicindela schaefferi occurs at other locations in the Dominican Republic at low elevations in riparian habitats based on specimens collected by Robert L. Davidson deposited at CMNH. Thus, it would appear that Brasiella dominicana also occurs in riparian habitats at low elevations, such as along the Rio Bani. This river originates in the southern end of the Cordillera Central and emerges from these mountains and flows along the eastern edge of Bani where Highway 2 crosses the Rio Bani (Fig. 19B). Additional inference about the collection site for Brasiella dominicana can be made from the better substantiated collection data for Brasiella ocoa, new species, which actually originated from a low elevation site along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic also in association with Cicindela schaefferi (refer to Ecology under that species account). These low elevation coastal plain habitats appear to be unusual for Brasiella species on Hispaniola based on ecological information provided by CMNH entomologist Robert L. Davidson. Davidson, who collected several of the new species of Brasiella described in this revision, reported encountering their adults only in the mountainous regions of Hispaniola. Because Brasiella dominicana occurs in low elevation habitats, it would appear that Brasiella species on Hispaniola actually occupy a wider habitat range than previously thought (Erwin and Pearson 2008). Adults of the type series of Brasiella dominicana were collected in August and September indicating an adult activity period during the later summer months.
Fig. 22. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Peravia Province, Bani vicinity along Rio Bani. The town of Bani lies in the coastal plain on the southcentral coast of the Dominican Republic. The Rio Bani emerges from the southeastern end of Cordillera Central and flows along the eastern edge of the town. This species likely occurs elsewhere along the Rio Bani further southward toward the coast and northward into the Cordillera Central.
Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) and Brasiella ocoa, new species, are the only species on Hispaniola with an elytral pattern of shiny, white markings with all lunules wide, complete and boldly contrasting with the darker, background color in most specimens examined. Despite this superficial similarity, there seems little doubt that these two species are distinctive based on differences in the form of the sclerites within the aedeagus of males of each species. A comparison of the other morphological characters presented in the key and the descriptions for each species further support their distinctiveness. These two species also appear to be allopatric based on the limited collection data currently available. However, additional collecting may change our understanding of their allopatry. Despite this distinctiveness as separate species and apparent allopatry, it is interesting to note that these two species seem to occupy a similar habitat type along the flood plains of major rivers flowing from the southeastern end of the Cordillera Central in Peravia Province, Dominican Republic. In these flood plain habitats, both species appear to have developed different habitat requirements from other species on Hispaniola. Their limited geographic distributions in close proximity to each other, and their similar requirements for low elevation habitats, may be the result of a common lineage.

The label data on the type specimens do not provide coordinates for the site where the holotype originated. However, Las Abejas is a locality often visited by entomological expeditions to the Sierra de Baoruco, the mountains in the eastern area of the southernmost part of the Dominican Republic. The type locality is established here with coordinates shown above based on data published by Woodruff (2004) for Scarabaeidae specimens collected at Las Abejas by Robert L. Davidson and John E. Rawlins on their 1987 CMNH expedition to the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic. Fig. 20A depicts the ravines typically found at upper elevations on the southern slope of the Sierra de Baoruco; Las Abejas being one of the ravines accessible by a footpath from higher elevations (refer to Ecology below).

The type series was collected at 1250 m within Las Abejas, a deep ravine abruptly descending from the forests of Hispaniolan Pine, Pinus occidentalis Swartz 1788, that cover the higher elevations on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco (Konstantinov and Chamorro-Lacayo 2006). The habitat at Las Abejas has a premontane, wet forest, rich in epiphytes (Fisher-Meerow and Judd 2008). As shown in Fig. 20A, these moist forests occur in ravines at upper elevations along the southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco. Fig. 20B depicts the highly erosive nature of the clay soils on these slopes, and Fig. 20C depicts the diverse nature of the vegetation along the footpath descending into the higher parts of Las Abejas. In these habitats, the adults of Brasiella iviei would appear to be rarely seen, and if they were seen, then to readily escape hand collecting by running into the vegetation. Indeed, nearly all the known adult specimens of this new species were collected with flight intercept or malaise traps. Fig. 20D shows a tropical malaise trap set up in an opening along a trail within the forest at Las Abejas during the 1987 CMNH expedition to the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic. Based on the type series of Brasiella iviei collected in August and September, this new species likely has its period of adult activity during the later summer months.

This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of Michael A. Ivie, Department of Entomology, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana. Ivie collected the first series of Brasiella specimens in 1988 from the Sierra de Baoruco, Pedernales Province, Dominican Republic, as part of his West Indian Beetle Fauna Project (WIBP). He previously considered these specimens to be only variants of Brasiella dominicana (Mandl). I am grateful for the opportunity he has provided for me to examine these WIBP specimens because it has led to the discovery of Brasiella iviei,and other related new species in the Sierra de Baoruco, an area in the Dominican Republic known for its high endemism (Woodruff 2004).
Brasiella iviei appears to be most closely related to Brasiella rawlinsi. However, their distinctiveness as separate species was established in this revision by differences presented in the key to their identification and under their descriptions. Adults of the former species are larger in body size with a proportionately longer head and pronotum than any known individuals of Brasiella rawlinsi in the Sierra de Baoruco. Also, elytral markings of Brasiella iviei, although still faint compared to other species on Hispaniola, are more obvious and wider than the majority of known Brasiella rawlinsi specimens. Males of these two species possess distinctive aedeagus inner sac sclerites, in particular, the form of the stylet. Additional differences between females of these two species are evident in the extent to which the membranous, longitudinal median band is developed on the 5th abdominal sternum, the size of the lateral gibbosities on the 6th abdominal sternum, along with the breadth and depth of the median notch on the 8th abdominal sternum. In addition to these morphological differences between Brasiella iviei and Brasiella rawlinsi, each species occurs in a markedly different habitat, despite their adjacent locations in the Sierra de Baoruco. As presented under Ecology for each species, Brasiella iviei is found in moist habitats of mixed deciduous forests, whereas Brasiella rawlinsi occurs in drier grassland habitats within pine forests.

Adults of this species are active in October based on the type series of two male specimens collected by David Brzoska on sand and gravel in the flood plain of the Rio Ocoa at 130 m (Fig. 19D). Brasiella ocoa occurred at its type locality in association with a much larger tiger beetle species, Cicindela (Plectographa) schafferi W. Horn 1903, based on information from Dave Brzoska that accompanied the Brasiella ocoa specimens. Robert L. Davidson also collected Cicindela schaefferi specimens at this Rio Ocoa location on a 1987 CMNH expedition to the Dominican Republic. He collected adults of this larger tiger beetle species both on the shoreline and on the gravel riverbed along the Rio Ocoa (Fig. 19D).
Fig. 22. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Peravia Province, Las Carreras vicinity along Rio Ocoa flood plain south of Highway 2. This species likely occurs elsewhere along the Rio Ocoa south toward the coast and further north into the Cordillera Central.
This Latinized eponym, a noun in aposition, is derived the Rio Ocoa, a major river that originates in the southern end of the Cordillera Central, flows across the southwestern coast of Peravia Province, and empties into the Caribbean Sea along the border with Azua Province in the Dominican Republic.
Brasiella ocoa, new species, superficially resembles Brasiella dominicana, an allopatric species that occurs nearby apparently along the Rio Bani (refer to Ecology for the latter species). However, their distinctiveness as separate species has been established by differences in the sclerites within the adult male aedeagus and other characters presented in the key and under their descriptions. Nonetheless, that fact that both species appear to have similar habitat requirements in low elevation flood plains, in contrast to the high elevation montane habitat requirements of most other Brasiella species known from Hispaniola, suggests that they may share a common lineage.

This species occurs along dirt roads, road cuts, and bare areas in fields in the foothills on the north slope of the Cordillera Central at 1290 m elevation (Figs 19E, 19F). From the collection records June, July, and August, it is concluded that adults of this new species are active during most summer months.
Fig. 22. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, Santiago Province, and La Vega Province, on the north slopes of the Cordillera Central. This species likely will be found in suitable habitats distributed over the entire northern slopes of the Cordillera Central.
This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the first name of the late Philip J. Darlington, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Darlington was the distinguished American carabidologist who pioneered studies of Carabidae island biogeography in the Mid-20th Century. The first specimens of this new species were collected by Darlington during his 1938 expedition to the Dominican Republic. Brian Farrell, also from MCZH, in 2008 collected additional specimens with more precise locality data, while retracing the route of Darlington's expedition 50 years earlier.
Both Brasiella philipi, new species, and Brasiella bellorum, new species, are allopatric in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, the former species on the northern slopes and the latter species in the mountainous central areas. The elytral pattern of both species is very similar and only differs in the form of the elytral lunules. Brasiella philipi possesses more fully developed and wider lunules of nearly uniform width, whereas the lunules of Brasiella bellorum are narrow and broken. These lunule differences are most obvious in the shape of the hook at the discal end of the middle band. Although the elytral patterns are similar, the distinctiveness of each species is established by differences in their genitalia, especially the form of the sclerites and spine fields within the aedeagus of the males. A comparison of the other morphological characters presented in the key and the descriptions for each species further support their distinctiveness. Although these two species are apparently allopatric based on available collection data, more collecting in the Cordillera Central will help confirm their allopatry. Despite their distinctiveness as separate species and apparent allopatry, it should be noted that these two species are found in similar mountain habitats with adults of both species active during the same summer months. Their geographic distributions in close proximity to each other in similar high elevation habitats suggest a common lineage.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Pedernales Province, 37 km N Cabo Rojo, 18Â°09'N, 71Â°35'W, 1500 m. Aerial view in Fig. 21A.
It is likely that the actual type locality lies at a slightly higher elevation than provided in this revision. CMNH entomologists visited this type locality again in June 2003, two years after the type series was collected (J.E. Rawlins, R.L. Davidson, 2010, personal communications). At that time, perhaps with improved GPS devices, the following coordinates and elevation were obtained with more precision: 18Â°09'23" N, 71Â°34'09" W at a slightly higher elevation of 1560 m. These coordinates and the elevation are based on data published by Woodruff (2004) for Scarabaeidae specimens collected at Aceitillar by Robert L. Davidson and John E. Rawlins on the 1987, 1991 and 2003 CMNH expeditions to this locality in the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic (Figs 20E, 20F). According to Woodruff (2004), the locality known as Aceitillar is based on a common Andropogon sp.grass that grows there in assocation with Pinus occidentalis Swartz; this grass is known locally as aceitillo; aceitillar being the place where the aceitillo grows. Indeed, Accitillar [Aceitillar] was printed on labels for certain paratypes of Brasiella rawlinsi originating with WIBP, and later Aceitillar appeared on labels from the June 2003 CMNH expedition to the Sierra de Baoruco.

This new species is found in the Dominican Republic across a range of higher elevations in the Sierra de Baoruco from 1250 to 1560 m. Its habitats are dominated by Hispaniolan pine, Pinus occidentalis Swartz, and Andropogon sp. grasses (Figs 20E, 20F, 21A, 21B). The red clay soil types prevalent in these habitats are derived from bauxite deposits that are surface mined and reclaimed extensively (Fig. 21A) in this part of the Sierra de Baoruco (Woodruff 2004). Adults have been collected in disturbed sites along dirt roads and trails during August and September. These adults were abundant along an infrequently traveled road where Robert L. Davidson collected the type series during the 1991 CMNH expedition to the Dominican Republic. This type locality is in the vicinity of the campsite used by the several CMNH expeditions to this locality (Fig. 20E). Adults were also abundant at several other sites at slightly lower elevations in 1988 based on WIBP collection data. It should be noted that CMNH entomologists have visited the type locality at other times of the year, July 1987 and June 2003, but no specimens of Brasiella rawlinsi were seen (R.L. Davidson, 2010, personal communication). Thus, adult activity for this new species appears restricted to a distinctive period during the late summer. In addition to hand collecting adults both running and flying, this new species has been taken in malaise and intercept traps. Brasiella rawlinsi occurs sympatrically with Brasiella iviei and Brasiella youngi in the Sierra de Baoruco, but in different habitats; the former species occurs in drier pine and grass woodlands, whereas the latter two species occur in mixed deciduous forests on the southern slopes of these mountains. Refer to the discussions under Ecology for Brasiella iviei and Brasiella youngi to obtain more details about their habitats.
Fig. 22. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Pedernales Province, Sierra de Baoruco at higher elevations in grass and pine habitats typical of the locality known as Aceitillar. Localities include: 37 km N Cabo Rojo at 1500 m (more precisely 1560 m); El Aceitillar ca. 35km NNW Cabo Rojo at elevations from 1250 m to 1430 m. This species in likely distributed throughout the Sierra de Baoruco at higher elevations in areas of red, bauxite soils in habitats with pines and grasslands.
This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of John E. Rawlins, Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The species name honors John for his encouragement and the assistance he provided to move this revision toward its completion. He also has been a colleague and friend for several decades while the author has been associated with the CMNH. Dr. Rawlins organized the several expeditions to inventory the insect fauna of Hispaniola that resulted in the collections of several of the new Brasiella species described in this revision.
The distinctiveness of Brasiella rawlinsi from the closely related Brasiella iviei was established in this revision by differences presented in the key to their identification and under their descriptions. Other than the more obvious differences in smaller body size and proportionately shorter head and pronotum of Brasiella rawlinsi compared with Brasiella iviei, important distinctions exist between the male aedeagus of these two species. Both species differ in the shape of the apical hook, as well as, the form of the sclerites of the inner sac, especially the thickness and degree of curvature in the stylet apex. Additional differences between females of these two species are evident in the extent to which the membranous, longitudinal median band is developed on the 5th abdominal sternum. Previously, M. Ivie (WIBP) and T.K. Philips (WKSU), who collected specimens of both these new species in the Sierra de Baoruco in 1988, initially thought the populations in these mountains might represent a new species; however, their unpublished study considered them only Brasiella dominicana variants (Philips 1994, personal communication).

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Pedernales Province, 13.5 km N Cabo Rojo, 18Â°02'04" N, 71Â°38'38" W at 140 m, in the Sierra de Baoruco. Aerial view taken at lower elevations on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco in Fig. 21E.
Notes on the Type Locality. No coordinates are on the holotype labels; however, an approximation of the coordinates shown above was obtained by measuring 13.5 km to 140 m along the only road north of Cabo Rojo using Google EarthÂ©. Deciduous woodlands adjoining desert scrub typically are found at this elevation on the lower southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco (Figs 21E, 21F). The allotype was collected at a site called Haitian Hut on the CMNH 1991 expedition (J.E. Rawlins, 2010, personal communication). The site was given this name because of the Haitian squatters who have gained easy access to the lower southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco by using the highway built by Alcoa, Inc., to reach bauxite mines higher in the Sierra de Baoruco (Woodruff 2004). The Haitian Hut site (Figs 21C, 21D), located in the deciduous forest accessible from the Alcoa highway, has coordinates of 18Â°06'42" N, 71Â°37'21" W at 730 m at 26 km N of Cabo Rojo; these slightly more precise coordinates, than originally obtained in the field, were based on using Google EarthÂ©.

The unique holotype male was collected at 130 m in a flight intercept trap in deciduous forest, whereas the unique allotype female specimen was collected in wet, deciduous forest at 730 m. Deciduous forest typical of the lower slopes is shown in Fig. 20F, whereas deciduous forest typical of the middle slopes is shown in Fig. 20D. Although the collection method for the allotype was not specified on its labels, a passive method of either malaise or yellow pan traps were both employed by CMNH staff while collecting at a site for several days. Both specimens were found on the lower south slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco in September. Vegetation in this part of the Sierra de Baoruco gradually transitions from desert-like habitats below 255 m through dry deciduous forest at 255 m to moist tropical forest and eventually grass and pine habitat at higher elevations (Woodruff 2004). Because of this great diversity of habitats, these mountains at the eastern end of the southernmost part of the Dominican Republic have high floristic and faunal endemism (Woodruff 2004).

This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the last name of Chen W. Young, Associate Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, PA, and world authority on the Diptera family Tipulidae. Chen participated in most of the expeditions by CMNH staff to the Dominican Republic and specifically the one that collected of this new Brasiella species. As a friend and colleague, I have the honor of naming this new species for him.
Brasiella youngi and Brasiella rawlinsi appear to be closely related species based on their male genitalia, but their distinctiveness as separate species has been established by differences in the external adult male and female characters presented in the key and under their descriptions. Obvious morphological differences between the two species are exhibited by the size of their eyes and the extent to which the pale elytral pattern is infuscated by the darker ground color. Other important distinctions exist between females of these two species in the depth and position of the female coupling sulcus, the extent to which the membranous, longitudinal median band is developed on the 5th abdominal sternum and the form of the emargination on the 8th sternum. Although both species occur in the Sierra de Baoruco at the same time of year, each species occurs at a different elevation in quite different habitats (refer to Ecology for each of these species). Brasiella youngi is less closely related to Brasiella iviei based on their male genitalia; although both of these species apparently occur in more moist habitats than Brasiella rawlinsi.

Although a phylogenetic analysis of Brasiella species on Hispaniola is not part of the present revision, a general discussion of the latest published phylogenetic treatment of Brasiella relative to the Hispaniola species, is considered relevant. Emphasis is placed on the composition of the Brasiella virdicollis species group, along with its current and ancestral geographic distributions in the West Indies. Such a discussion is considered relevant for suggesting further studies to investigate the phylogenetic relationships for the Hispaniola Brasiella species treated in this revision relative to other Western Hemisphere Brasiella.
Previous phylogenetic and biogeographic studies of tiger beetle genera in Brazil (Freitag and Barnes 1989) and West Indies (Freitag 1992) recognized that Brasiella sensu Rivalier possessed a unique suite of synapomorphous adult characters not found in related Western Hemisphere taxa of Cicindelinae. However, their studies treated BrasiellaRivalier 1954 subspecifically within Cicindela Linnaeus 1758, a concept held by many North American tiger beetle students, but not by those studying either elsewhere in the world or the higher classifications of Coleoptera. Consequently, in the most recent and comprehensive treatments of the world Geadephaga (Lorenz 2005) and Western Hemisphere Caraboidea (Erwin and Pearson 2008), Brasiella was recognized as distinct among Cicindelina Latreille 1802 lineages and given full generic status. Although treated as a distinctive genus, the latter authors considered the taxonomic status of species within Brasiella to be unstable, likely because further discovery of new species would require changes to the current classification. As the present revision demonstrates, the Neotropical Brasiella fauna is likely to be far richer than indicated by current faunal lists, especially after habitats have been more fully explored in both new and previously visited geographic areas throughout all seasons. Additionally, more detailed studies of genitalic structures, among populations of those species already described, may reveal cryptic species, as the present revision has shown to be the situation on Hispaniola.
Indeed, the discovery and description of new species periodically provides the opportunity to reconsider any existing published phylogeny so that the relationships of the new species to those previously described are better understood. One approach would be to use the criteria of the existing classification and simply fit the new species into it. This first approach seems appropriate when a small number of new species are considered from a restricted geographic area where populations have been adequately sampled such that the faunal diversity is considered to be entirely known. Another approach would be a more comprehensive reevaluation of the criteria of the existing classification in order to develop a revised classification. This second approach would be most appropriate when considering a large number of new species originating over broadly diverse geographic areas. Under this second approach, results would be most informative when populations from all these geographic areas have been adequately sampled.
Thus, for either approach the question of adequately sampling existing populations is critical to any meaningful reconstructed phylogeny. Because the present revision revealed new Brasiella species with each expedition to Hispaniola, there is a high probability that many additional new species will be discovered on this island. Further collecting is likely to find these, not only within new areas and habitats, but also within those previously visited, especially during different seasons on Hispaniola.
Even though the Brasiella populations on Hispaniola may not have been completely sampled, this present revision did provide an opportunity for subjective interpretations of the species relationships within this genus on Hispaniola based on the population samples that were collected thus far and studied by the author. These relationships were discussed earlier in this revision under the Remarks within each Species Account. Such interpretations, while based on the author's observations and experience with the species, should provide a working hypothesis for any future phylogenetic analysis designed to examine more rigorously the relationships among the Hispaniolan Brasiella species, all of which are endemic to this island and superficially appear similar to one another.
The current classification into species groups of nearly all Brasiella described at the time was presented by Freitag and Barnes (1989). Brasiella dominicana (Mandl), described in 1983, unexplainably was overlooked. However, this species later was studied and subsequently assigned to a species group within Brasiella by Freitag (1992). In their publication, Freitag and Barnes (1989) established seven species groups for 29 species within the genus based on a reconstructed phylogeny involving 50 adult morphological characters. Despite the fact that male genitalic characters of most species were not actually examined and documented by dissection, but rather interpreted only from the published descriptions and illustrations, their results were important because they provided a basis for all subsequent efforts to phylogenetically organize the ever-growing number of Brasiella species found in the Western Hemisphere. The latest catalogue (Erwin and Pearson 2008) treated 39 Brasiella species, and with the eight more added in the present revision alone, Brasiella is now at 47 species.
Although Freitag and Barnes (1989) established morphological characters and assigned their polarities--plesiomorphic (ancestral) or apomorphic (derived)--for all 50 adult characters, male and female genitalic characters were given the most value in establishing the species groups within Brasiella phylogeny. While they treated primarily Brazilian species in their publication, they did establish the viridicollis species group for several Brasiella species occurring in the West Indies together with one species from North America. However, this species group was not discussed in detail until Freitag (1992) studied the West Indian Cicindelidae. In that publication, he reassigned two Brasiella species he had originally placed within the viridicollis species group, and added one species he had previously overlooked, so that the species group at that time included the following three species--Brasiella viridicollis (Dejean 1831) from Cuba, Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) from Hispaniola, and Brasiella wickhami (W. Horn 1903) from northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The numerous new species described in the present revision have made it necessary to redefine the earlier concept of the Brasiella viridicollis species group. Decisions to include newly described species, or exclude those previously described, would result from applying the revised concept. The present revision suggests that the Brasiella viridicollis species group concept would be strengthened if a previously overlooked adult female structure, a small gibbosity located on each side of the 6th abdominal sternum, was included in its concept. This structure, and two membranous structures on the 5th abdominal sternum, are considered to be apomorphic. The synapomorphic gibbosity character for females of nearly all Hispaniolan Brasiella, as well as, the Cuban Brasiella virdicollis (Dejean). provides further evidence for treating the viridicollis species group as an evolutionary unit within the Brasiella. All three structures appear relevant to the Brasiella viridicollis species group concept and are discussed in detail here.
Freitag and Barnes (1989) were the first to report a membraneous structure along the posterior margin of the female 5th sternum. They considered this unusual female abdominal character unique within Western Hemisphere Cicindelinae and termed it an âunpigmented bell-shaped spotâ. However, this structure is actually membranous as explained above under Methods; thus, in the present revision it has been termed a âmembranous wedge.â The second membranous structure, also on the same female 5th abdominal sternum, is a longitudinal âmembranous bandâ, mesad and anterior to this membranous wedge. The membranous band does not seem to have been considered a separate structure by Freitag and Barnes (1989). These two structures exist for nearly all Brasiella species on Hispaniola. The exceptions being Brasiella ocoa whose females are unknown, and Brasiella davidsoni whose females plausibly have secondarily lost the 5th abdominal sternum structures.
The third structure is the small, raised gibbosity on each side of the female 6th abdominal sternum located mesad on each surface. These two gibbosities have not been previously mentioned in any publication dealing with Brasiella phylogeny (Freitag and Barnes 1989)(Freitag 1992). As mentioned above, these abdominal gibbosities are considered an important apomorphic character for including or excluding species within the established Brasiella species groups. The gibbosity character is synapomorphic for females of eight of the nine Brasiella species on Hispaniola; Brasiella ocoa is known only from males, but its females are likely to possess this character.
Those species in the Brasiella viridicollis species group that do not occur on Hispaniola require consideration. Apparently, two subspecies of Brasiella virdicollis now have been recorded on Cuba; the nominotypic subspecies and Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi (Kippenhan, Ivie & Hopp 2009). Cicindela fernandozayasi was proposed as a replacement name (Kippenhan et al. 2009) for Cicindela carbonariaZayas 1988 (Zayas 1988). Zayas (1988) described his species from a single specimen without any detail as to where it was collected on Cuba. This taxon currently is classified as Cicindela viridicollis fernandozayasi (Kippenhan, Ivie & Hopp 2009), but treated as a Brasiella in this revision. This subspecies has a completely black dorsal body color compared to nominotypic Brasiella viridicollis with its distinctive blue green head and pronotum contrasting with dull brown elytra covered by metallic blue green flecks.
Nominotypic Brasiella virdicollis (Dejean) possesses all three of these apomorphic structures on the two last visible sterna based on the author's study of female specimens from Cuba, Cienfuegos Province, Minas Carlota, Sierra de Trinidad, at CMNH. The same cannot be said for the second subspecies because no specimens of Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi were available for examination. This subspecies is known only from its holotype deposited in the Fernando Zayas Collection in Havana, Cuba (Kippenhan et al. 2009). There seems little doubt about its placement within the Brasiella viridicollis species group, however, its subspecific status may need to be reconsidered. The color image of the type presented by Kippenhan et al. (2009) exhibits some morphological characters different from the nominotypic Brasiella viridicollis that suggest it may represent a separate species. Although the sex of the holotype of Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi was not indicated when it was described as Cicindela carbonariaZayas 1988, nor when it received its current replacement name, it appears to be a male. The conclusion is based on the expanded setal pads on the proximal three tarsomeres, the shape of its elytral apices and the protruding abdomen from the illustration and image in these two publications. When compared with a male of Brasiella viridicollis, the most obvious difference between these two subspecies, other than their strikingly different dorsal body color, lies in the large, laterally bulging eyes of Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi compared with the smaller, less bulging eyes of the nominotypic Brasiella viridicollis. Final resolution about the specific status of each subspecies must await additional examination of their types, as well as, the discovery of more male specimens of Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi whose genitalia can be dissected.
Evidence is presented here that Brasiella wickhami (W. Horn) should not be considered part of the Brasiella viridicollis species group. This species has been included within the Brasiella viridicollis species group (Freitag and Barnes 1989, Freitag 1992) on the basis of its aedeagus having a shield rounded at the apex and slightly protruding from the male genitalia. However, the shield for Brasiella wickhami is actually a more complex sclerite than the simple shield possessed by the other species within the Brasiella viridicollis species group. Rivalier (1955) depicted the shield of Brasiella wickhami as a large sclerite with both a rounded knob and a pointed section at the apex. My examination of specimens from Arizona at CMNH, confirm this more complex shield shape. Moreover, Brasiella wickhami females lack the lateral gibbosities on the 6th abdominal sternum. From these findings, it is suggested that Brasiella wickhami should not be a part of the Brasiellaviridicollis species group. The assignment of Brasiella wickhami to another species group within Brasiella must await a phylogenetic analysis of the other mainland species in the Neotropics of North and Central America.
As the previous discussion suggests, the revised Brasiella viridicollis species group concept includes only the following ten species and two subspecies arranged here alphabetically by country and species within each country:
Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi (Kippenhan, Ivie & Hopp) â Cuba
Brasiella viridicollis viridicollis (Dejean) â Cuba
Brasiella bellorum, new species, Acciavatti â Dominican Republic
Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) â Dominican Republic
Brasiella iviei, new species, Acciavatti â Dominican Republic
Brasiella ocoa, new species, Acciavatti â Dominican Republic
Brasiella philipi, new species, Acciavatti â Dominican Republic
Brasiella rawlinsi, new species, Acciavatti â Dominican Republic
Brasiella youngi, new species, Acciavatti â Dominican Republic
Brasiella darlingtoniana, new species, Acciavatti â Haiti
Brasiella davidsoni, new species, Acciavatti â Haiti
How these current species distributions within the Brasiella viridicollis species group may have been influenced by their ancestral geographic distributions should be briefly considered. Previous biogeographic studies of tiger beetle genera in the West Indies provided only a partial explanation of the possible pathways by which the Brasiella viridicollis species group may have arrived on Cuba and Hispaniola from its ancestral distributions. According to Freitag (1992), the dispersal pathway accounted for the ancestors of the Brasiella on Cuba and Hispaniola. He suggested that these Brasiella ancestors where originally distributed in Middle America and arrived on these islands most likely through biogeographical patterns of dispersal common to tiger beetles. He did not distinguish between active and passive dispersal mechanisms for the large, actively flying Cicindela species compared with the small, primarily cursorial Brasiella species. Dispersal as a pathway implied movement of species from ancestral distributions in the Yucatan Peninsula or Nicaragua Highlands to the Greater Antilles over wide water gaps. Such dispersal might be rare, but likely has occurred over time even for small Brasiella species, as documented recently for Brasiella viridicollis from Cuba to the Florida Keys(Schiefer 2004).
Although the dispersal pathway undoubtedly has influenced the currrent distribution of the Brasiella viridicollis species group, the vicariance pathway also should be considered in explaining current geographic distributions. Woodruff (2004) provided insight into the likely influence of both dispersal and vicariance on the current geographic distributions for Phyllophaga species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae) on Hispaniola. He summarized the concepts about the geologic history of Hispaniola prevalent at the time of his revision.
Brasiella species divergence on Hispaniola apparently occurred after the arrival of the ancestral members of the Brasiella viridicollis species group. Species divergence likely was greatly influenced by the extent and duration to which populations were isolated, especially during the Pleistocene. During interglacial episodes in that geologic time period, the Caribbean Sea would have risen from melting continental glaciers and inundated the lowlands. Lowland inundation over a long time could have kept populations isolated the longest in the highest and most widely separated mountain masses, such as the Massif de la Hotte in southwestern Haiti, where the most divergent Brasiella davidsoni presently exists on Hispaniola. All these biogeographic concepts discussed here should be considered, and discussed in greater detail, when interpreting future phylogenetic studies as to how the Brasiella species on Hispaniola relate to each other, as well as, to the other Brasiella species in the Neotropics.
In the latest and most comprehensive taxonomic treatises of Caraboidea, Brasiella is established as a distinct genus which is confirmed by a suite of synapomorphic characters. Earlier taxonomists, such as Walther Horn, who examined the Brasiella specimens first collected by Philip Darlington in Haiti, assigned all the Brasiella on Hispaniola to the widespread Neotropical Brasiella argentata (Fabricius). More recent taxonomists, such as Richard Freitag, considered all the Brasiella specimens on Hispaniola to be the insular endemic Brasiella dominicana (Mandl). The current revision of the Brasiella tiger beetle fauna on Hispaniola suggests a greater species diversity exists on this island than previously recognized.
From a comparison of the holotype and paratypes of Brasiella dominicana (Mandl) with other Brasiella taken on Hispaniola, it was concluded that this species is restricted to a small area likely along the Rio Bani where it flows from the eastern end of the mountainous Cordillera Central onto the southern coastal plain in the Dominican Republic. A closely related species, Brasiella ocoa, new species, also occurs allopatrically at low elevations west of this area along the Rio Ocoa near the coast. At high elevations in the Cordillera Central are found two other allopatric species: Brasiella bellorum, new species, from the central portions, and Brasiella philipi, new species, from the north slopes of this mountain range, respectively. Compared with Brasiella dominicana, Brasiella ocoa appears to be more closely related, whereas, Brasiella bellorum and Brasiella philipi,are more distantly related species.
Three endemic species isolated in the Sierra de Baoruco in southern Dominican Republic, appear to be sympatric, but occupy different ecological habitats along an altitudinal gradient. Brasiella iviei, new species, the largest species in Hispaniola, occurs in moist, mixed deciduous forests at upper elevations. Brasiella rawlinsi, new species, occurs in drier grass and pine dominated habitats at higher elevations, whereas, Brasiella youngi, new species, occurs in wet, deciduous forested habitats at lower elevations. All three of these species have individuals whose elytral markings are faint or completely obliterated by the darker background color with shiny iridescent flecks. In this regard, these three species appear to be more closely related to each other than to the other Brasiella species on Hispaniola.
The Brasiella in neighboring Haiti presently are known to occur only in the highest mountains of that country. Brasiella darlingtoniana, new species, from the Massif de la Selle, Haiti, and the most divergent species, Brasiella davidsoni, new species, from the Massif de la Hotte, Haiti, appear to be more closely related to each other than to the other Brasiella species on Hispaniola.
All nine Brasiella species on Hispaniola belong to the viridicollis species group within the earlier subgeneric concept of Cicindela (Brasiella) as established by Freitag and Barnes (1989) and Freitag (1992) from their phylogenetic studies of Brazilian and West Indian tiger beetles. Brasiella viridicollis viridicollis (Dejean), and Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi (Kippenhan, Ivie & Hopp) occur on Cuba. Evidence is presented for considering Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi (Kippenhan, Ivie & Hopp) may represent a distinct species within the species group, and for removing Brasiella wickhami (W. Horn) from this species group.
As elucidated by Freitag (1992), ancestors of the Brasiella viridicollis species group on Hispaniola and Cuba would have arrived there most likely through biogeographical patterns of dispersal common within the Greater Antilles from ancestral distributions in Middle America through the Yucatan Peninsula or Nicaragua Highlands. The degree to which Brasiella species diverged after arrival on Hispaniola apparently has been greatly influenced by the extent and duration of their isolation during Pleistocene interglacial periods when the Caribbean Sea filled the lowlands. Lowland inundation for long periods of time would likely have isolated populations in separate mountain masses on Hispaniola, thereby fostering species divergence. The most widely separated mountain masses, such as the Massif de la Hotte in southwestern Haiti, in fact, have the most divergent species, Brasiella davidsoni,presently known on Hispaniola. All the biogeographic concepts of dispersal and vicariance should be discussed in greater detail when interpreting future phylogenetic studies as to how the Brasiella species on Hispaniola relate to each other and to those in the Neotropics.
