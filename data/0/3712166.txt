In the article "Serum bilirubin as a prognostic marker in patients with acute decompensated heart failure", by Chintanaboina J et al. (Korean J Intern Med 2013;28(3):300-305), byline mistakenly indicated that Jayakrishna Chintanaboina. There is a spelling mistake of an author's name, and they want to change to Samir Pancholy from Sameer Pancholy. We regret the error.
