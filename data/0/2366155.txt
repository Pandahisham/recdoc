Background: A concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may alter the natural history of other infections. Several reports indicate that syphilis may behave more aggressively when HIV infection is present.
Case: A woman presented with a rash involving her hands and feet and progressive loss of the vision in her right eye. Her serologic tests for syphilis and HIV infection were positive. A diagnosis of neurosyphilis was confirmed by an analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). She was treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) penicillin. Her skin lesions resolved, but her vision did not improve.
Conclusion: The incidence of HIV infection among women is rising. A patient with HIV and syphilis may develop neurosyphilis in a much shorter time than a patient without HIV infection.
