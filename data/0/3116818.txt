In humans, traumatic experiences are sometimes followed by psychiatric                        disorders. In chimpanzees, studies have demonstrated an association between                        traumatic events and the emergence of behavioral disturbances resembling                        posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We addressed the                        following central question: Do chimpanzees develop posttraumatic symptoms,                        in the form of abnormal behaviors, which cluster into syndromes similar to                        those described in human mood and anxiety disorders?
In phase 1 of this study, we accessed case reports of chimpanzees who had                        been reportedly subjected to traumatic events, such as maternal separation,                        social isolation, experimentation, or similar experiences. We applied and                        tested DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and major depression to published case                        reports of 20 chimpanzees identified through PrimateLit. Additionally, using                        the DSM-IV criteria and ethograms as guides, we developed behaviorally                        anchored alternative criteria that were applied to the case reports. A small                        number of chimpanzees in the case studies met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and                        depression. Measures of inter-rater reliability, including Fleiss'                        kappa and percentage agreement, were higher with use of the alternative                        criteria for PTSD and depression. In phase 2, the alternative criteria were                        applied to chimpanzees living in wild sites in Africa                        (n = 196) and chimpanzees living in sanctuaries with                        prior histories of experimentation, orphanage, illegal seizure, or violent                        human conflict (n = 168). In phase 2, 58% of                        chimpanzees living in sanctuaries met the set of alternative criteria for                        depression, compared with 3% of chimpanzees in the wild                        (p = 0.04), and 44% of chimpanzees in                        sanctuaries met the set of alternative criteria for PTSD, compared with                        0.5% of chimpanzees in the wild (p = 0.04).
Chimpanzees display behavioral clusters similar to PTSD and depression in                        their key diagnostic criteria, underscoring the importance of ethical                        considerations regarding the use of chimpanzees in experimentation and other                        captive settings.

Since nonhuman animals, including chimpanzees, are frequently used in research, there                is an ethical imperative to understand the potentially adverse effects of captivity                and their use in research. The association of pathological behaviors with captivity                in nonhuman primates has been noted for decades [1]–[9]. In fact, the relationships                between captivity and adverse physical, social and psychological effects have been                the foundation for many attempts to develop “models” of human                psychopathology, especially following from the early work of Harry Harlow [10]. For example,                it is widely recognized that premature separation from mothers reliably leads to a                range of adverse behavioral and social effects in chimpanzee infants [11], [12]. Likewise, other                unfavorable rearing conditions, social isolation, prolonged captivity, sensory                deprivation, and use in laboratory experimentation have been reported to be                contributors to behavioral pathology in nonhuman primates [13]–[16]. Several authors have                demonstrated the prevalence of abnormal behaviors, ranging from whole-body                stereotypies to self-injurious behaviors, in chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates                in captivity [6],                    [15], [17], [18].
In humans, anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and mood                disorders, such as major depressive disorder, are commonly diagnosed after acute,                repeated, or chronic trauma. These types of stressors can sometimes overwhelm normal                physiological responses, which can cause persistent physiological and structural                changes [19],                    [20].
Brain structures and neuroendocrine mechanisms associated with mood and anxiety                disorders are shared across a wide range of vertebrates [19]–[24]. An evolutionary psychiatry                framework, as described by Brüne [25], Stevens and Price [26], Fabrega [27], and others, also predicts                similarities across species in genetic, developmental, and environmental risk and                protective factors for psychopathology. Similarly, changes, disruption, or                dysfunction of common neuropsychiatric systems can result in similar patterns of                symptom expression.
The hippocampus, found in all mammals, is a brain structure involved in memory                storage and retrieval. In humans, PTSD has been associated with reductions in                hippocampal volume or activity, perhaps because of recurrently and chronically                elevated levels of cortisol, followed by down-regulation of the                hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Abnormalities of this axis have been described                in animals subjected to confinement, restraint, isolation, or surgical procedures                    [22], [23].
Qualities exhibited by chimpanzees demonstrate that they have perceptual abilities,                memory, cognition, and emotions, all of which have varying levels of importance for                the development of psychiatric disorders. Like human children, young chimpanzees                inspect and manipulate objects that do not function as expected in a familiar task,                reflecting a foundation of causative understanding [28]. When adequate information                about causation is apparent in problem-solving tests, young, wild-born chimpanzees                ignore irrelevant information and improvise solutions [29]. Chimpanzees'                understanding of causal relationships in the environment is further illustrated by                varied, sophisticated use of tools, and dozens of tool use have been described in                wild chimpanzee adults [4], [30], [31].
Chimpanzees demonstrate self-awareness in standard mirror tests [32], even in infancy [33]. As adults,                chimpanzees have demonstrated joint attention (gaze following with a similar focus                of attention) [34], selective cooperation [29], and deception [35], each reflecting                an awareness of what others know. Learning and memory develop rapidly during the                first 2 years of life [36], and young chimpanzees can outperform adult humans on                complex short-term memory tests [37]. Moreover, chimpanzees are capable of remembering objects                    [38] and place                    [4] following                intervals of years or even decades since prior exposure.
Despite the many similarities between humans and nonhuman primates, it is uncommon to                study psychopathology in nonhuman primates using the terms and tools of human                psychiatry. Moreover, pathological behaviors in these individuals are often                described in isolation without being distilled into recognizable syndromes. Still,                such behaviors are widely recognized as abnormal [39], in that they are not                typically present in wild populations [4], [40].
There is empirical support for using psychiatric diagnostic criteria for nonhuman                primates. Complex PTSD, depression, and other psychiatric conditions have been                diagnosed in other species, including chimpanzees [14], [22], [23], [41]–[46], although it is unclear how                appropriate the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,                    4th Ed.) criteria [47] or other traditional methods of assessing psychopathology                are for use in species other than humans.
Efforts to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in chimpanzees and other                animals encounter special challenges. Diagnostic criteria for mood and anxiety                disorders typically require verbal descriptions from subjects of their experiences                and internal states. The inability of nonhuman primates to report symptoms presents                obstacles similar to those in pediatrics, psychiatry, and geriatrics, often                requiring special investigative methods, including gathering information from                relevant third parties [48]–[52]. As in the care of humans,                the reports of specialized observers, such as technicians and staff, have been used                successfully to assess and study well-being [53]–[55] and personality in chimpanzees                    [56]–[59] and other                primates [2]                for decades.
Here, we describe an investigation to apply formal diagnostic criteria for mood and                anxiety disorders to chimpanzees in which we address two fundamental questions: (a)                Do traumatized chimpanzees develop posttraumatic symptoms expressed in the form of                psychiatric disorders? (b) If they do, are DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for these                disorders adequate to describe posttraumatic disorders in chimpanzees?
In the first part of the study, we hypothesized that behavioral disorders in                chimpanzees would fit one of three mutually exclusive possibilities: (a) a number of                traumatized chimpanzees would reliably meet DSM-IV criteria for PTSD or depression;                (b) traumatized chimpanzees would manifest few or only transient symptoms; (c)                traumatized chimpanzees would develop many of the symptoms of psychiatric disorders,                but would not reliably meet DSM-IV criteria. If hypothesis (a) was supported, we                would conclude that PTSD and depression occur in chimpanzees in forms similar to                those described in human adults. If hypothesis (b) was supported, we would conclude                that the disorders of interest do not occur in chimpanzees. Finally, if hypothesis                (c) was supported by our findings, we would conclude that disorders similar to those                occurring in humans occur in chimpanzees, but that the diagnostic criteria and                perhaps the definitions of syndromes need revising to be appropriate for this                species. For the second part of the study, we hypothesized that there would be                differences between the wild and sanctuary populations in the prevalence of                constellations (clusters) of abnormal behavior.
The presented study strictly adhered to the legal requirements of the countries                    in which it was conducted. Approval for the study was provided by the governing                    body of each site participating in the study and by the Uganda National Council                    for Science and Technology, the Uganda Wildlife Authority, and the National                    Council of Science and Technology under the Ministry of Higher Education,                    Science and Technology in the Republic of Kenya. Exemption for institutional                    review board approval was determined by an independent, external institutional                    review board because the study did not involve research on human subjects. The                    study relied on long-term experience of the people who were the most familiar                    with individual chimpanzees and did not directly impact the chimpanzees –                    no pain or suffering was inflicted, and authors relied on the historical                    observations of people who knew the chimpanzees. Chimpanzees involved lived in                    the wild or in sanctuaries as close to chimpanzees' natural habitat as                    possible.
In this study, while addressing the fundamental questions described above, we                    also aimed to (a) understand the nature and epidemiology of psychiatric                    conditions among great apes, and (b) quantify the prevalence among chimpanzees                    of behavior clusters that are comparable to human psychiatric disorders. We                    followed methods similar to those reported by Scheeringa [49] for the development of                    alternative criteria for PTSD in nonverbal infants and children. The study was                    conducted in two phases. In phase 1, we applied the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria                    to published case reports of traumatized chimpanzees, and we developed and                    tested alternative criteria for these disorders to compare them to the DSM-IV                    criteria. The alternative criteria developed in phase 1 were used in phase 2. In                    phase 2, we collected and compared observations of captive and wild chimpanzees.                    We applied the alternative diagnostic criteria to two groups: the first was a                    sample of chimpanzees currently living in sanctuaries as a result of previous                    use in laboratory research, illegal trade and seizure, or being orphaned; the                    second was a sample of chimpanzees living in the wild.
The case reports for phase 1 were published in previous scientific reports;                        to obtain them, we searched “PrimateLit,” a database funded by                        the National Institutes of Health of all primate literature from 1940 to the                        present (our search was completed September 30, 2009). We did a global                        search using the umbrella term “nonadaptive,” which includes                        stereotypies and other behavioral and psychological pathologies, and limited                        our search to the genus Pan. The search returned 384                        results that met our initial criteria.
Articles were screened to exclude conference abstracts, books, and formats                        other than journal articles (240 items). After 9 items were removed because                        they were not in English, the remaining 135 articles were screened to                        determine if they met the following criteria:
They reported original data on one or more individually identifiable                                chimpanzees (i.e., they were not group-level comparisons, population                                proportions, etc.).
They reported in detail on behaviors that are recognized as                                pathological in animals (e.g. stereotypic locomotion, hair plucking,                                self-mutilation) and humans.
Information in the article or title suggested that there had been                                some potentially adverse or traumatic experience such as maternal                                separation, being orphaned, chronic close confinement,                                experimentation, social isolation, or a similar experience.
Using these inclusion criteria, we found that 20 cases in a total of 12                        published papers provided adequate detail for review. Most of these articles                        included details for more than one individual and, in certain cases, more                        than one article was about the same individual(s) at different times or with                        a focus on different details. Information about the individual case studies                        and the citations for the associated articles are listed in Table 1                        [14],                            [60]–[70].
The 21 items in the DSM-IV comprising the criteria for PTSD and the 13 items                        in the DSM-IV comprising the criteria for major depression were applied to                        the 20 published cases. Three raters who were aware of the purpose of the                        study rated all 20 cases independently. Each of the raters had a background                        in primatology and was familiar with normative and abnormal chimpanzee                        behaviors. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by calculating Fleiss'                        kappa (Κ) and the percentage agreement for each item.
In consultation with experts in primatology, ethology, psychology, and                        psychiatry, we then constructed an expanded checklist of symptoms designed                        to account for chimpanzee/human differences. Based on careful review of                        inventories of chimpanzee behavior (“ethograms”) from wild,                        sanctuary and zoo settings, we matched behaviors previously documented among                        chimpanzees in those settings to specific DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for                        PTSD and depression. Appropriate changes to the wording of questions in the                        DSM-IV were also made. Our goal was to make the expanded checklist of                        symptoms, and therefore the alternative criteria, behaviorally anchored. We                        paid special attention to ensure that the clusters of symptoms (i.e. the                        sets of alternative criteria), as revised, had face validity, in that they                        were similar to the criteria for PTSD and depression listed in the DSM-IV.                        We asked the raters to apply the expanded checklist of symptoms to each case                        study. The frequency with which items were reported in the case studies, the                        reliability coefficients, face validity, and consultation with experts were                        all used in a selection process to determine whether to keep, eliminate, or                        modify items, in order to create a set of alternative criteria for PTSD and                        depression for use in the remainder of the study (Tables 2 and 3).
In phase 2, the expanded symptom checklist, followed by the alternative                        diagnostic criteria for PTSD and depression developed in phase 1, were                        applied to chimpanzees at eight sites (three wild sites,                        [n = 196] and five sanctuary sites                        [n = 168], including two African sanctuary                        sites and three sanctuary sites in North America, Asia, and Europe that                        housed chimpanzees formerly used in laboratory research). The five sanctuary                        sites were combined for the purposes of this study. The study included                        heterogeneous populations of various ages and both sexes: 56% of the                        chimpanzees living in the wild were female and 49% of chimpanzees                        living in sanctuaries were female. Chimpanzees in African sanctuaries had                        histories that included illegal trade, being orphaned, or violent human                        conflict. Chimpanzees previously used in laboratory research had been used                        in experimentation for HIV, hepatitis, or other purposes. These chimpanzees                        had been exposed to various degrees and periods of sustained confinement,                        disruption of primary attachments, removal from social groups, repeated                        phlebotomy, capture, anesthetic injections via syringe or dart guns,                        invasive procedures, induced diseases, or chronic isolation. A small sample                        of the chimpanzees living in the wild had histories of injuries resulting                        from snares, spears, or similar objects.
Using the expanded checklist of symptoms developed in phase 1, caregivers at                        the sanctuaries provided information about chimpanzees that was based on                        their past observations of the chimpanzees' persistent behaviors during                        the time in which the raters knew these individuals. We used parallel                        methods to assess wild chimpanzees. Trained individuals who work at selected                        field sites with chimpanzees were asked to complete the surveys for specific                        individuals. In each of the eight settings, three surveys were completed by                        three different observers for each chimpanzee. While respondents were                        informed that the study related to primate behavior, all were masked to the                        study hypotheses. There was some variation in job duties among respondents,                        e.g. night versus daytime rounds, which provided opportunities for                        observations in different contexts. Responses were made independently and                        without consultation. This approach capitalized on the intimate knowledge                        and long-term experience of the people who were the most familiar with                        individual chimpanzees while minimizing the impact on the chimpanzees.                        Existing historical behavioral data from chimpanzees at these field sites                        provided further context for corroborating findings in any cases that proved                        particularly unusual or informative. Test-retest was assessed in a random                        sub-sample of raters and chimpanzees at each site. This random subset of                        raters was asked to complete the questionnaire twice, separated by an                        approximately 2-week interval. Intra-rater percentage agreement was used to                        determine the reliability of the raters' assessments. Cohen's                        kappa (K) was calculated to produce the most conservative estimate of                        intra-rater reliability.
Additionally, medical and behavioral records and other source documents were                        reviewed for each chimpanzee, with special attention paid to previous                        exposures to injury, illness, and related information. Other demographic and                        life history data were drawn from site records, including age, sex, birth                        origin (wild or captive), rearing condition (maternal, nursery, or other),                        duration of captivity and sanctuary residence, medical condition(s),                        dominance rank, and current social group composition.
Frequency analyses were performed to determine the prevalence of clusters of                        behaviors that we used as alternative criteria for PTSD and depression, and                        the wild and sanctuary populations were compared. A composite score was used                        for the purposes of the study, to determine if a chimpanzee met alternative                        criteria for PTSD or depression. Differences were tested for statistical                        significance using a Mann-Whitney U Test. An α of 0.05 was used for all                        statistical tests, using SPSS, version 18.0.
In phase 1, a small number of chimpanzees met DSM-IV criteria for post-traumatic                    stress disorder or for major depression, according to raters (Table 4). For major                    depression, one rater deemed three chimpanzees met DSM-IV criteria. However, the                    other two raters found no chimpanzees who met DSM-IV criteria for major                    depression. For PTSD, using the DSM-IV criteria, one rater deemed that four                    chimpanzees met criteria; another rater deemed that two chimpanzees met                    criteria; and another rater deemed that three chimpanzees met criteria.
We used a selection process to test different sets of alternative criteria for                    PTSD and depression for use in the remainder of the study, by considering                    items' face validity and reliability coefficients, the frequency with which                    items were reported in the case studies, and consultation with experts. Using                    the optimal set of alternative criteria for PTSD we identified, three raters                    agreed the same three chimpanzees met diagnostic criteria. Using the optimal set                    of alternative criteria for depression we identified, one rater deemed that                    three chimpanzees met criteria; another rater deemed two chimpanzees met                    criteria; and another rater deemed that no chimpanzees met criteria.
Measures of reliability were higher using the alternative criteria for PTSD and                    depression, compared with the DSM-IV criteria for these disorders. For PTSD,                    percentage agreement among the three raters for each of the 21 items for the                    DSM-IV criteria ranged from 27% to 73%                    (median = 43%), while the inter-rater reliability                    Κ values for the three raters ranged from −0.30 to 0.30                    (median = 0). In contrast, percentage agreement among the                    three raters for each of the items in the alternative criteria for PTSD ranged                    from 63% to 100% (median = 82%), and                    inter-rater reliability Κ values ranged from 0.10 to 0.70                    (median = 0.50). The percentage agreement among the three                    raters for each of the 13 DSM-IV items for major depression ranged from                    12% to 67% (median = 48%), and the                    inter-rater reliability Κ values for the three raters ranged from                    −0.40 to 0.40 (median Κ = −0.10). In                    contrast, percentage agreement among the three raters for each of the items in                    the alternative criteria for depression ranged from 63% to 100%                    (median = 87%) and inter-rater reliability Κ                    values ranged from 0.10 to 1.0 (median = 0.50).
In phase 2, there were differences between chimpanzees living in sanctuaries and                    those living in the wild in the percentages of abnormal behaviors (alternative                    criteria developed in phase 1) reported, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. When we tested the clusters of alternative                    criteria (i.e. the sets of criteria shown in Tables 2 and 3), there were significant differences                    between chimpanzees living in sanctuaries, compared with chimpanzees living in                    the wild. As shown in Figure                        3, 58% of chimpanzees living in sanctuaries met the definition                    for depression based on an alternative set of criteria, compared with 3%                    of chimpanzees living in the wild (p = 0.04). Similarly,                    44% of chimpanzees in sanctuaries met the definition for PTSD based on                    alternative criteria, compared with 0.5% of chimpanzees in the wild                    (p = 0.04). Where duration of behavior was reported,                    approximately 89% of the individual items for alternative criteria for                    depression (Figure 1) and                    PTSD (Figure 2) were                    reported to persist for at least 1 year. Upon retest, percentage agreement                    within raters for individual symptoms averaged from 81% to 97%,                    with Cohen's kappa averaging from 0.40 to 0.80 at the eight sites.
A chimpanzee named Negra was a 36-year-old female at the time of the study.                        Taken from the wild in Africa as an infant, she has remained in captivity                        since that time. She was used in invasive research, including hepatitis                        experiments, and for breeding. Each of her infants was removed from her at                        an early age. During the period in which she was used in research, she was                        kept in isolation for several years. Approximately 1 year prior to the                        study, she was transferred to Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest in Washington                        state, where she currently lives with six other chimpanzees.
Negra met alternative criteria for depression and PTSD. According to reports,                        she had persistent depressed hunched posture, and she was socially                        withdrawn. Negra slept excessively during the daytime, and she lacked                        interest in play, food, other individuals, and grooming. She also                        demonstrated poor attention to tasks. She was described as slow and                        sluggish, and at times, she appeared anxious. In response to an unexpected                        touch, she would “threat bark,” scream, or run away. Compared                        with other chimpanzees, she demonstrated less variability in her facial                        expressions. Caretakers reported that her face was expressionless,                        “like a ghost,” for at least a month after she arrived at the                        sanctuary. She seldom, if ever, exhibited a play face. She was tested for a                        thyroid disorder and assessed for other medical causes of her clinical                        presentation, but all laboratory tests were within normal limits. Based on                        later reports provided by her caretakers, some of her symptoms have improved                        since she has been living in the sanctuary. She has become more interested                        in other chimpanzees, including grooming, and the variability in her facial                        expressions has increased.
A chimpanzee named Mawa was a 14-year-old male at the time of the study. He                        arrived at the Ngamba Island sanctuary in Uganda at approximately 3 years of                        age. Mawa originated from Congo, where he was kept as a family pet for about                        one year before being confiscated. He had serious injuries from a rope tied                        around his waist when he arrived at the sanctuary, but these wounds healed                        normally and have not caused any lasting disability.
Mawa met alternative criteria for depression and PTSD. Once at the sanctuary,                        Mawa initially resided with a group of younger chimpanzees and was                        designated as an alpha male, according to sanctuary staff. His group was                        later integrated into a larger mixed-age group. Mawa did not adjust quickly                        to the change in his social milieu, including his lower relative rank once                        he was living with adults. This led to conflict and antagonism with large,                        adult males after the integration. When fleeing fights, he would sometimes                        escape over an electrified fence. To mitigate the conflict, Mawa was moved                        to temporary housing in an enclosure adjacent to another adolescent and two                        juveniles. Despite efforts for reintegration, Mawa did not cope successfully                        and thus remained in the transitional housing for some time, extending                        through the study period.
Survey responses revealed that Mawa showed a number of avoidance and fear                        behaviors. Signs of hyperarousal, such as excessive displaying and being                        easily irritated or angered, were also reported. Despite limited social                        companionship during this time, Mawa did not show significant interest in                        grooming chimpanzees in adjacent enclosures. He was reported to engage in                        some self-directed behaviors when alone, as well as feces smearing.
In spite of his challenges, Mawa interacts with caregivers, including                        receiving tickling and grooming from them. Following the study period, Mawa                        started a new reintegration process with the larger chimpanzee group with                        some success. He has made progress in integration and some of the signs                        reported during the study have diminished. He shows some positive,                        pro-social behaviors.
A chimpanzee known as Eslom was born in 1994 in a wild chimpanzee group that                        has been observed routinely for a scientific research and conservation                        program in Uganda. At the time of the study, Eslom was 16 years of age, and                        he remains a member of the same group. His history indicated that                        Eslom's mother died in 2007. Since that time, he has provided some                        caregiving for his younger sister, who exhibited ongoing behavioral effects                        from being orphaned at a young age. During the time of the study,                        Eslom's sister, Euro, disappeared from the group unexpectedly.                        According to reports, Eslom showed signs of “missing” Euro.
Like several other members of his community, records showed that Eslom has a                        history of having been caught in a snare. His left arm was ensnared in June                        2009, but he was able to pull the snare from the ground and drag the snare                        along with him. Because the injury was substantial, a veterinary team                        tracked Eslom through the forest and tried to shoot him with a tranquilizer                        gun to remove the snare and provide veterinary care. The veterinary team was                        not successful as Eslom kept avoiding them. Eslom spent a significant time                        away from the main groups followed by the observers, and his whereabouts                        were unknown by observers for approximately two months. After two months,                        Eslom reappeared in the community without the snare. His wounds healed                        normally and there were no lasting, physical disabilities stemming from the                        snare injury.
Raters reported that Eslom exhibited several ongoing behaviors consistent                        with the alternative criteria for PTSD. Some behaviors had an onset of two                        to five years before the survey, although some behaviors were first observed                        within the last year. Raters reported that Eslom has shown a particular fear                        of humans since the summer of 2009 and that he retreated when cameras were                        pointed at him. Results reflected that Eslom exhibits several behaviors                        associated with hyperarousal, including excessive displaying and screaming,                        and being easily irritated or angered. It was noted that his screaming                        behavior changed with the change in his group status. He remained aroused                        for unusually long periods of time, and it took him a long time for him to                        calm down after incidents. Observers described that these episodes were                        suggestive of “tantrums”. Avoidance and fear behaviors were                        reported, along with social withdrawal. Eslom was often the first to awaken                        and leave sleeping nests in the morning. Unlike most male chimpanzees of his                        age, Eslom did not engage in male-male grooming. He spent a significant                        amount of time grooming with his sister, more than any other chimpanzee.                        Eslom rarely affiliated with other group members. He traveled through the                        forest alone or with his sister.
Today, Eslom is more tolerant of observers and he continues to spend a                        significant amount of time with his sister.
Our study shows that previously traumatized chimpanzees demonstrate persistent                abnormal objective symptoms and that these symptoms cluster into syndromes that are                similar to PTSD and depression. We began this investigation with three mutually                exclusive hypotheses. The first hypothesis, that a number of traumatized chimpanzees                would reliably meet DSM-IV criteria for PTSD or depression, was not wholly supported                in phase 1. Although a number of chimpanzees met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD and                depression in this phase, measures of inter-rater reliability were low. The second                hypothesis, that chimpanzees would manifest few, if any, criteria for PTSD or                depression, was also not supported. In both phase 1 and phase 2, multiple signs of                abnormal chimpanzee behaviors similar to the criteria for PTSD and depression were                reported. The third hypothesis, that chimpanzees would display clusters of symptoms                that are similar to disorders such as PTSD and depression, was supported. Measures                of reliability were greater among raters when testing the alternative criteria. This                is likely partly attributable to attempts to reduce the need to make inferences                about thoughts or feelings.
The significant differences we found in phase 2 between the wild and sanctuary                populations in the percentage of chimpanzees who met a set of alternative diagnostic                criteria for PTSD and depression suggest that syndromes similar to PTSD and                depression are identifiable in previously traumatized chimpanzees. We propose that                these diagnostic terms be used, when applicable, in chimpanzees and offer criteria                for their use.
The study has important limitations. Chimpanzees cannot clearly articulate their                thoughts, feelings, and experiences to humans, although a few have learned to                communicate using sign language. In phase 1, ratings of psychopathology were made                from published studies and case reports. These reports may have contained biases                that could have influenced the raters. It is also possible that these reports did                not include sufficient information for raters to accurately assess the cases for                evidence of mood and anxiety disorders. The low measures of inter-rater reliability                observed for some of the items composing the alternative criteria for depression and                PTSD merits further exploration. However, the optimal sets of alternative criteria                for PTSD and depression were tested and selected based on multiple factors,                including the frequency with which items were reported in the case studies, each                items' face validity and reliability coefficients, and consultation with                experts. It is likely that reliability would have improved further with more                training of raters. It was reassuring that there was 100 percent agreement                (K = 1.0) among raters for the diagnosis of PTSD, when testing                the set of alternative criteria in phase 1. Since there is no gold standard for the                assessment of mood and anxiety disorders in chimpanzees, it is not possible to                establish the external validity of the alternative criteria we developed.
In phase 2, the design was not longitudinal and therefore did not allow for full                assessment of the duration of symptoms and impeded the assessment of severity. The                study was not designed to capture simultaneous observations, therefore making it                difficult to assess inter-rater reliability. Observers were asked to recall specific                behaviors over differing time periods (the time in which they knew the chimpanzees).                A question might arise about the comparability of data collection in the wild and                sanctuary chimpanzees. Therefore, it is important to note that chimpanzees at the                wild sites are typically observed for five days per week from dawn to dusk as part                of systematic behavioral study. The raters at the sites have job duties which                require them to observe and record very detailed features of behavior on a daily                basis. The chimpanzees are recognized by unique features, such as scars, freckles,                and other facial and body features that require clear view. When animals are not in                close physical proximity, raters from the wild sites use high-quality binoculars to                view them to ensure proper individual identification and detailed behavioral data.                In our review of ethograms, we noted that some of the wild chimpanzee behaviors                recorded included facial expressions and fine motor tasks. Additionally, chimpanzees                at some of the sanctuaries can roam freely outdoors and out of view of the raters,                sometimes comparable to distances from raters in the wild. However, given the                extensive work that the raters have with the chimpanzees, there were sufficient                opportunities to view the detailed study behaviors in wild and captive settings. It                is likely that the prevalence of behaviors such as physiological reactions (e.g.                heavy or irregular breathing) would be underestimated, rather than overestimated, at                the wild and sanctuary sites.
Possible refinements for future studies include greater attention to behavioral                duration and severity, respondent experience, and incorporation of other abnormal                behaviors specific to chimpanzees, such as self-mutilation, smearing of feces,                urophagia, and regurgitation and reingestion. In terms of the present study, it is                important to note that the approach taken does not account for disorders that may                occur in chimpanzees but not in humans, or for the assessment of more global                dysfunction that may be measured using instruments such as surveys on subjective                well-being [54],                among others. Symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders can be disabling, even when                full diagnostic criteria for specific psychiatric disorders are not met, as is often                the case in human children and adolescents [71].
Strengths of the current study include a robust sample size in phase 2 representing a                wide age range of both sexes, as well as reports of trained observers, the broad                spectrum of behaviors assessed, and the ability for caregivers to report                observations in a relatively unrestricted but structured setting. The clusters of                symptoms, as revised, had face validity, in that they were similar to symptoms for                PTSD and depression listed in the DSM-IV.
Future research may include further tests for validity and reliability, along with                the evaluation of correlates for specific items and diagnoses using the alternative                criteria described in our study. Additionally, longitudinal follow-up would be                helpful for the interpretation of this study's findings.
Our study's findings underscore the association between psychopathology and                conditions that include captivity, confinement, physical harm, loss of social bonds,                and isolation. Mood and anxiety disorders such as PTSD and depression are commonly                diagnosed among humans exposed to significant acute, recurrent, or persistent trauma                    [72]–[76]. This study suggests that chimpanzees can exhibit                syndromes similar to PTSD and depression as a result of potentially traumatic                experiences.
