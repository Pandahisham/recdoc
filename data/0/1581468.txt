Objectives. Our aim is evaluating the need for repeatingtests for syphilis on pregnant women in the third trimester.Study design. A single-center retrospective cohort studywas performed on all women delivering 7/03–6/04.Results. During the study interval, 2244 women deliveredat our hospital. Of those women having available records andattending at least one prenatal visit, 1940 (98.9%) werescreened for syphilis at the first prenatal visit. Of the 1627women beginning prenatal care prior to 27 weeks and deliveringafter 32 weeks, 1377 (84.6%) were rescreened in the thirdtrimester. No cases of syphilis were identified with either theinitial (upper limit of 95% CI 0.24%) or repeat (upperlimit of 95% CI 0.34%) screening. Conclusions. Inour obstetric population, syphilis is so uncommon that mandatedprenatal screening on more than one occasion seemsunjustified and laws requiring repeated screening shouldbe reevaluated.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend screening all pregnant women for Chlamydia trachomatis infection and syphilis at the first prenatal visit. Repeated screening for these infections during thethird trimester is recommended for those women at increased riskfor contracting these infections. Screening for gonorrhea once ortwice during pregnancy is recommended for those women at risk[1].
Most states have laws requiring that women undergo screening forsyphilis at least once during pregnancy. Nine states, includingFlorida, have statutory requirements that pregnant women undergoscreening for syphilis both at the first visit and again in thethird trimester [2]. At least in Florida, there is no similarlaw requiring prenatal screening either for gonorrhea orChlamydia trachomatis infection.
Screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during pregnancyhas been advocated as being cost-effective as long as theprevalence exceeds 1% [3]. The reported prevalence ofgonorrhea during pregnancy varies widely, with rates varyingbetween 0 and 10%, depending on the risk status of patients[4–6]. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatisinfection during pregnancy is higher than that ofgonorrhea [7, 8]. Syphilis is the least common of the sexuallytransmitted infections that are endemic to the United States. In2003, cases of primary and secondary syphilis occurred at a rateof 2.5 cases per 100 000 population [9]. Since reaching anadir in 1999, the number of cases has increased slightly over thepast few years. However, this increase has been confined to menwho have sex with men [9].
We sought to evaluate the prevalence of syphilis in the obstetricpopulation delivering at Shands Hospital at the University ofFlorida. By doing so, we wanted to evaluate the utility ofrepeating screening tests for syphilis during the third trimester.
We performed a historical cohort analysis of all women deliveringat Shands Hospital at the University of Florida from 1 July 2003to 30 June 2004. For consideration of screening for syphilis atthe first prenatal visit, all women who attended at least oneprenatal visit were included. For consideration of the utility ofrepeating the screening in the third trimester, women wereincluded in the cohort if they began prenatal care prior to27-weeks gestation and delivered after 32 weeks, so as to allow aminimum of 6 weeks between first-visit testing and delivery. Screening for syphilis utilizednontreponemal tests of serum samples confirmed with treponemaltests. Screening for gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatisinfection used a combined test of DNA probes from cervical swabspecimens. The exact types of tests and manufacturers varied,depending on the payer-specified laboratory for specificpatients. The University of Florida Health Science CenterInstitutional Review Board approved the study.
Subjects meeting criteria for inclusion in the cohort wereidentified from the delivery log maintained in the Labor andDelivery Unit at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida andfrom the database maintained by the Division of Maternal-FetalMedicine at the University of Florida. Medical record charts ofthese women were abstracted, and data were entered into arelational database (Access 2000, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,Wash). SAS Version 9.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was utilizedfor statistical analysis.
Rates of screening for syphilis at the first prenatal visit andagain in the third trimester were calculated. The prevalence ofinfection with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (modified Waldmethod) was calculated. We anticipated that the inclusion of oneyear of delivered patients would yield a cohort of over 1000patients undergoing repeated third-trimester screening, allowing95% confidence intervals of less than 3%. The unpairedStudent's t test was used for continuous data. Categorical datawere analyzed with the uncorrected chi-square and Fisher's exacttests as appropriate. All tests of statistical significance weretwo-tailed and utilized an alpha of 0.05.
During the study interval, 2244 women delivered at our hospital,and 2085 charts were available for review. Of the 1962 women whohad at least one prenatal care visit, the mean age was 25.8(standard deviation (SD) = 6.3) years. Fifty seven percent ofwomen were white, 25% were black, and 18% were of otherethnicities. Sixty two percent of women were parous, 64% wereunmarried, 75% had either government-sponsored or“self-”payer status, and 18% reported a priorhistory of at least one sexually transmitted infection (gonorrhea,Chlamydia, syphilis, genital herpes,trichomoniasis, or HIV). The first prenatal visit forthese patients occurred at a mean gestational age of 13.7 (SD =6.9) weeks. Of the 1962 women who had at least one prenatal carevisit, 1724 (87.9%) were screened for gonorrhea andChlamydia trachomatis infection at the first prenatalcare visit. Of these women, 19 (1.1%) had gonorrhea and107 (6.2%) had a Chlamydia trachomatis infection.
Of the 1962 women who had at least one prenatal care visit, 1940(98.9%) were screened for syphilis at the first prenatal carevisit. No cases of syphilis were identified with this initialscreening (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0,0.24%). Ofthe 1627 women beginning prenatal care prior to 27 weeks anddelivering after 32 weeks, 1377 (84.6%) were screened in thethird trimester. Similar to the results of screening at the firstprenatal visit, no cases of syphilis were identified with thirdtrimester screening (95% CI = 0,0.34%).
Our study is limited by its retrospective nature. Also, these dataare from a single center during a single year, and they may not begeneralizable to other obstetric populations. However, theprevalence rates of gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatisinfection in our population are similar to those in otherhigh-risk clinic populations [10]. Therefore, we believe thatit is unlikely that the prevalence of syphilis in our populationis significantly lower than it would be in the majority ofpractice settings in the United States.
In this study, compliance with our state's legal requirement forscreening for syphilis at the first visit was excellent(98.9%). Others have reported similarly high first-visitscreening rates for syphilis and for other tests that are includedin some sort of “prenatal battery” [11]. Compliance withthe legal requirement for repeating screening in the thirdtrimester was lower (84.6%). Reasons for this lower rate ofscreening than at the first visit likely include patient refusaland provider apathy due to the rarity of the infection.
The primary goal of screening pregnant women for syphilis is toprevent cases of congenital syphilis. Currently, the total numberof cases in the United States each year is approximately 400[9]. As with the rate of syphilis in women, the incidence ofsyphilis in newborns also is decreasing. Syphilisdisproportionately affects those living in urban areas. Mostcounties in our state and others rarely report a case ofprimary or secondary syphilis in adults, much less acase of congenital syphilis.
Clearly, because of the untoward consequences of congenitalsyphilis, screening women once during pregnancy for this infectionis reasonable and well justified. However, we believe that thestatutory requirement, as currently exists in Florida and 8 otherstates, to screen all women twice during pregnancy for aninfection that is as rare as syphilis currently should bereevaluated.
