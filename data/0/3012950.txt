PSYCHOTIC JEALOUSLY: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY

Sociodemographic, clinical, marital and sexual characteristics of 50 consecutive patients having delusions of infidelity were studied. Females outnumbered males after excluding alcoholics. Most of the patients were older than 30 yrs. and the onset occured more than 20 yrs. after marriage in about half the patients. Male patients were more often eldest siblings as compared to females. About one third of the patients had a history of marital and sexual difficulties prior to onset. The “third person” involved in the delusion was often a family member, particularly in patients coming from joint families. Possible causes of tie-in between delusion of jealousy and social factors are discussed.
