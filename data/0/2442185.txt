Spontaneous perforation of the extrahepatic biliary system is a rare presentation of ductal stones. We report the case of a twenty-year-old woman presenting at term with biliary peritonitis caused by common bile duct (CBD) perforation due to an impacted stone in the distal common bile duct. The patient had suffered a single herald episode of acute gallstone pancreatitis during the third trimester. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy, bile duct exploration, and removal of the ductal stone. The postoperative course was uneventful.

Perforation of the biliary system occursmost frequently in the gallbladder, usually associated with (and complicatingupto 10% cases of)   acute cholecystitis. Perforation of the extrahepatic biliarytree is a rare entity, accounting for less than 10% of intraperitoneal biliaryrupture [1].
Bile duct perforation is most commonly described in infants related to congenitalbiliary system anomalies. Aetiology in the adult is commonly attributable tointramural infection, necrosis of the wall of the bile duct secondary tothrombosis, increased intraductal pressure secondary to obstruction, cirrhosis,and direct erosion by calculi. Overall, 70% of cases are related to calculi[2].
The incidence of biliary tract disease during pregnancy ranges from 0.05–0.3% [3]. Despite these apparent lowfigures, complications from gallstones represent the most common general surgical conditionrequiring surgical intervention, second only to appendicitis [4]. Indications for intervention of gallstones during pregnancyinclude obstructive jaundice, acute cholecystitis, or pancreatitis failingmedical management. We present the case of a young woman diagnosed withgallstones in late pregnancy, complicated by acute gallstone pancreatitis andsubsequently spontaneous common bile duct perforation.
A twenty-year-old primigravida woman wasplanned for elective caesarean section due to breech presentation. The patienthad a past medical history of α-Thalassemia trait, but was notnormally on regular medication. Her mother had previously undergone acholecystectomy for gallstones.
At 34 weeks gestation, she presentedacutely with a two-week history of worsening abdominal pain localised to theepigastric region, associated with vomiting. On examination, tenderness was localised to the epigastrium and right upper quadrant. Blood results revealed raised inflammatory markers (WBC 14.4 [4.0–11.0],neutrophils 11.9 [2.0–7.5], CRP 60[0–7.5]) and evidence of pancreatitis (amylase 1369 IU/L [36–128]), mildlyraised bilirubin (24 μmol/L [0–20]) and raised alkaline phosphatase (183 IU/L[35–91]). An abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple small gallstones and athickened gallbladder wall, but no evidence of a dilated intra or extrahepaticbiliary system. The patient was treated conservatively, rapidly improved, and liver function testsnormalised. She was discharged three days later.
Six weeks later, she was readmitted with severe abdominal pain. She was pyrexial(39.3°C), tachycardic, and hypotensive. Abdominal examination revealed severe generalisedabdominal tenderness with evidence of peritonism. An emergency caesareansection was performed and a term baby delivered, but no obvious cause was foundto explain her clinical condition.
The following day her clinical condition worsened, with progressive abdominal painand a metabolic acidosis. She required aggressive resuscitation, inotropic, and ventilatory support and was,therefore, admitted to the intensive care unit. A computed tomography (CT)revealed extensive free peritoneal fluid and gas of which the aetiology was notapparent. The patient underwent a prompt laparotomy and was found to havegeneralised biliary peritonitis. The gallbladder was intact but a 2 mmperforation was found on the anterior surface of a dilated commonbile duct (12 mm). On table cholangiography suggested obstruction of the distalcommon bile duct caused by a 5 mm gallstone impacted within the distal commonbile duct.The calculus was removed, and the duct was repaired over a T-tube. Repeatcholangiography showed no residual obstruction. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and wasdischarged on day seven. A T-tube cholangiogram was performedafter 4 weeks, and the tube was uneventfully removed (Figure 1).
Although the pathogenesis of spontaneous biliary perforation is poorly understood,recognised mechanisms include the following: calculous perforation at the siteof impaction; calculous erosion without impaction; increased canalicularpressure due to obstruction by tumour, stone, or spasm of the sphincter ofOddi; intramural infection; mural vessel infarction leading to mural necrosis;or rupture of a biliary tract anomaly such as cyst or diverticulum [5]. Thus,because perforation of the biliary system is a recognised complication ofcholelithiasis, the diagnosis should be suspected if a perihepatic abscess orperitonitis is combined with biliary stone disease.
As early as 1882, Freeland [6] reported the first case of extrahepatic biliary system rupture in an adult (diagnosed at autopsy), an entity that wassubsequently first described in pregnancy by Piotrowski et al. [2] over acentury later. Since this time, very few cases of spontaneous common bile ductperforation in adults have been reported in the literature, with casesoccurring during pregnancy being even more scarce. The importance of this clinicalscenario lies in the potential serious morbidity and not infrequent mortalityassociated with missed biliary system perforation.
Petrozzaet al. [7] described two cases of gallbladder perforation due to cholelithiasis inthe early postpartum period. Both cases presented a diagnostic dilemma, and itwas concluded that a history of cholelithiasis in a patient with persistentintra-abdominal symptoms in the postpartum period must alert to promptinvestigation and early management. Talwar et al. [8] report twocases of biliary tract rupture under similar circumstances. In their series,one patient was found to have suffered gallbladder rupture as a result ofcholecystitis, and in the second, a common bile duct perforation was found atlaparotomy with no obvious precipitating cause. McGrath et al. [9] also drewattention to the similarity of symptoms of gallbladder disease in pregnancy tomild pre-eclampsia, having in common hypertension, epigastric pain, and mildlyderanged liver function tests. These cases highlight the importance ofrecognising the possibility of delayed diagnosis of cholelithiasis as a resultof nonspecific abdominal symptoms during pregnancy and indicate earlyinvestigation and treatment in order to reduce serious morbidity.
Severalreports exist of successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy during pregnancy.Block and Kelly [10] reported the optimum time for surgical management ofgallstone pancreatitis to be in the second trimester or early postpartumperiod, in order to minimise maternal/fetal mortality and recurrentpancreatitis.
Unfortunately, in those women presentinglate in pregnancy (as in the case described), the balance of risk favourswatchful waiting until after delivery followed by elective cholecystectomy.Certainly, this risks early recurrence of acute pancreatitis, as well as rare but severeconsequences such as biliary peritonitis. Whether an early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP)and sphincterotomy in those cases presenting with gallstone pancreatitis can bean acceptable temporary preventive measure is unclear, but undertaking ERCP isnot without risk, and the potential risks should be considered carefully inindividual cases. In this particular case,it is impossible to know whether the eroding calculus had been present during theinitial episode of pancreatitis. Magnetic resonance scanning is a commonly usedimaging modality in obstetrics, considered to be safe and avoiding the use ofionising radiation. Therefore, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP) would have been a reasonable next investigation during this patient’sinitial presentation, and if a ductal stone had been revealed, then the indicationfor ERCP may have been clearer.
On the other hand, neonatal and postnatalcare of babies born early have progressed significantly, suggesting thepossibility of induction of labour perhaps at 36–38 weeksgestation in severely symptomatic or high-risk patients. Of course, every casemust be considered individually, taking into account maternal and fetalhistory and health.
