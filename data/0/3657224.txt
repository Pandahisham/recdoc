Widespread Confluent, Annular, and Circinate Patches and Plaques in a 56â€“Years-Old Woman


A 56-year-old female presented with 1-year history of pruritic, extensive skin eruption. The lesions tend to wax and wane in severity. The onset was from dorsal aspect of her right foot. Extremities, lower abdomen, buttocks, and intertriginous areas then involved. Different topical treatments were used with no significant improvement. She had experienced a weight loss (30 kg in 2 years). She had a 6-year history of normocytic normochromic anemia with unknown etiology. Also, she had an adult-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) since 12 years ago. Her family history was positive for hypertension (HTN) and DM in her first-degree relatives. Physical examination showed an anemic patient with bilateral angular cheilitis, glossitis [Figure 1], and nail changes (nail color change, brittleness, onycholysis, nail striations) [Figure 2]. Widespread scaly, eroded, confluent, annular and circinate patches and plaques, some as large as 15 cm in diameter, with superficial bulla and necrosis were seen [Figure 3]. She had no detectable organomegaly. Occular, oral, and genital mucosa were intact. Routine lab tests revealed mild thrombocytopenia, normocytic normochromic anemia, and hyperglycemia. A skin punch biopsy was performed from an active lesion on her left leg.

The microscopic study revealed a psoriasiform acanthosis, prominent and confluent necrosis of the upper layer of stratum spinosum with neutrophilic exocytosis. Furthermore, mild epidermal hyperplasia, vacuolar change, and deficient granular layer were noted. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltration and scattered extravasated RBCs were in the upper dermis [Figure 4].
