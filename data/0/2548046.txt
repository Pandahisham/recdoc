Bioanalysis is determining the concentration of drugs andmetabolites in biological fluids (i.e. plasma and urine). Duringthe past 15 years tremendous advances in bioanalysis, for exampleHPLC, auto injectors, data collection systems and robotics hasenabled the productivity of the bioanalyst to increase but it stillrequires considerable manual intervention. This paper describes therationale, the justification and the plans Bristol-MyersSquibb has to completely automate the entire bioanalytical process.
