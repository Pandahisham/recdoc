The Association of Squamous Oesophageal Cancer and Thyroid Disease

In 178 consecutive oesophageal squamous carcinoma cases, 5% (9 cases) had had thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or thyroid carcinoma. The incidence in males was 1% (1 case) and in females 8% (8 cases). This incidence was in excess of other known associations of oesophageal cancer and in this series, it was exceeded only by previous gastric surgery for peptic ulceration.
