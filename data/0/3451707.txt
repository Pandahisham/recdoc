Neurophysiological assessment of craniofacial pain

This review deals with the diagnostic usefulness of neurophysiological testing in patients with craniofacial pain.
Neurophysiological testing of trigeminal nerve function relies on trigeminal reflexes and laserâ€“evoked potentials (LEPs). This review briefly describes the physiology of trigeminal reflexes and LEPs, reports normal values and highlights the neurophysiological abnormalities in the main clinical conditions.
