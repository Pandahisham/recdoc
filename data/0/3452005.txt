Preventive non–pharmacological treatment andnitric oxide in chronic migraine

In chronic migraine thecentral sensitisation and thechanges of regional cerebral bloodflow are mediated by nitric oxide(NO) and oxygen free radicals.Biofeedback is considered a preventivenon–pharmacological treatmentdecreasing migraine attacks.We investigated whether biofeedbackeffectiveness is related torelaxation processes and its influenceon oxidative stress. TheMigraine Disability AssessmentScore (MIDAS) and serum NO stablemetabolites (NOx) were evaluatedin 20 patients with chronicmigraine before and at the end ofbiofeedback sessions. MIDAS scorewas lower after biofeedback thanthat reported before treatment. NOxserum levels were higher afterbiofeedback than those measuredbefore starting treatment. Thus, theeffectiveness of biofeedback isrelated to a muscular relaxation andto its influence on NO bioavailabilityin patients with chronicmigraine.
