This is pain


Have I told you how much it hurts?
I can't cough but I have to
I can't breathe but I want to
I can't move, it makes me sad
People's pity I hate, your kind words I dislike
This is pain.
Have I told you how much it hurts?
Hoped pills would help but didn't
Wished sleep would but couldn't
Beyond hope, beyond reason
Alive but dead, dead but not gone
In anger I ask, why me?
This is pain.
Have I told you how much it hurts?
In pain I cry
In pain I'm all alone
Clouds of misery hover above me
Angels in white smile at me
Into a distant world I fly
I long to leave
Away from the pain forever.
