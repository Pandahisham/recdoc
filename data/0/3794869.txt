Comprehensive overview: efficacy, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of irbesartan

Hypertension represents a major health problem, affecting more than one billion adults worldwide. Irbesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, is considered to be a highly effective treatment in the management of hypertension. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile , and cost-effectiveness of treatment with irbesartan in hypertension.
A review of the literature was conducted using the electronic PubMed and Cochrane Library databases and the Health Economic Evaluations Database of search terms relating to irbesartan efficacy, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness, and the results were utilized.
Findings from the present analysis show that irbesartan either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents can achieve significant reductions in blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, compared with alternative treatment options. Irbesartan was also found to have a renoprotective effect independent of its blood pressure-lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. Furthermore, irbesartan demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile , with either lower or equal adverse events compared with placebo and other alternative treatments. In terms of economic analyses, compared with other antihypertensive therapy alternatives, irbesartan was found to be a preferred option, that is less costly and more effective.
The evidence indicates that treating patients with hypertension alone or with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy using irbesartan can control hypertension, prolong life, and reduce costs in relation to existing alternatives.

According to the World Health Organization, hypertension, defined as a systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, affects more than one billion adults worldwide.1 Hypertension is a major health problem and a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and related death.2 The prevalence of hypertension varies among European countries, the US, and Canada based on the results of a systematic review. Notably, the prevalence of hypertension for Europe was 44.2% compared with 27.8% in the US and 27.4% in Canada.3 The main factors that contribute to the development of high blood pressure can be attributed to social determinants such as age, income, educational level, unhealthy diet, tobacco consumption, physical inactivity, and excess of alcohol, and also to metabolic risk conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and raised blood lipids, and finally to other cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, and finally to kidney disease.1
Antihypertensive therapy can effectively reduce BP, and therefore reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and may thus prevent mortality. Early on, management of hypertension was done with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors interfere with the renin-angiotensin system by direct blockade of ACE, thereby reducing the circulating concentrations of angiotensin II. However, they do not block angiotensin II production completely, because angiotensin II can be generated by non-ACE pathways. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists/blockers represent a relative newer class of antihypertensive agents, developed to overcome some of the deficiencies of ACE inhibitors.4–6 Angiotensin II receptor blockers selectively block AT1 receptors, preventing binding of angiotensin II, inhibiting the renin angiotensin system, and lowering BP.
The antihypertensive efficacy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension has been evaluated and compared with ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and diuretics in several studies.7–20 Angiotensin II receptor blockers also slow the progression of renal disease associated with hypertension, have excellent tolerability, in fact similar to that of placebo, and are associated with a significantly lower incidence of adverse events.
Irbesartan belongs to this group of drugs and is approved for the treatment of hypertension, and is indicated for lowering BP either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It is a long-acting angiotensin II receptor blocker compared with some of the other drugs in this class, (eg, losartan and valsartan), characterized by high selectivity and significant blockade of the AT1 receptor. Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy of irbesartan in reducing BP and establishing control in large patient populations with mild-to-moderate or severe hypertension. Irbesartan is also approved for the reduction of progression of renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. The objective of the present study was to review and synthesize the published evidence on the efficacy, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of irbesartan.
The electronic PubMed and Cochrane Library databases and the Health Economic Evaluations Database were searched using the term “irbesartan”. All the resulting citations were screened to find out whether they were concerned with the efficacy, tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of irbesartan. This approach generated 41 studies evaluating irbesartan as monotherapy or as combination therapy in patients with hypertension only and/or type 2 diabetes and nephropathy and in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, and also 15 cost-effectiveness studies. Studies were included in the review only if they were published in full papers and in the English language.
Irbesartan has a rapid and almost complete absorption after oral administration, with maximum plasma concentration after administration (Cmax) occurring at approximately 20 minutes regardless of dose, ie, 50 mg or 150 mg, and an average bioavailability of 60%–80%, significantly higher than for losartan and valsartan, the oral bioavailability of which is approximately 33% and 23%, respectively.21–23 Food does not affect the bioavailability of irbesartan in contrast with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, such as losartan and valsartan, the bioavailability of which is shown to decrease or be slowed by food.4,24 In addition, pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, time required to reach Cmax (tmax), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), increased in a dose-dependent, linear manner, after irbesartan doses of 150–600 mg in healthy subjects.25 Analysis of trough concentrations of irbesartan indicated that a steady-state level of irbesartan was achieved within 3 days of single daily doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg.25 The volume of distribution of irbesartan at steady state is approximately 53–93 L, showing that irbesartan distributes into the extravascular space.22 Finally, irbesartan has the highest degree of plasma protein binding at approximately 96%.
Irbesartan is metabolized via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. After either oral or intravenous administration of irbesartan, more than 80% of the circulating plasma radioactivity is attributable to unmetabolized irbesartan.26 The primary circulating metabolite is the inactive irbesartan glucuronide conjugate (approximately 6%). Remaining circulating metabolites do not add substantially to the pharmacologic activity of irbesartan. Irbesartan and its metabolites are excreted by both biliary and renal pathways. Following administration of an oral or intravenous dose of irbesartan, approximately 20% of the total radioactivity has been found to be recovered in the urine and the remainder in the feces.4,26,27 The elimination half-life of irbesartan averages 11–15 hours. In vitro studies showed that irbesartan is oxidized mainly via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C9, with negligible metabolism by 3A4.28
Two studies in hypertensive patients have evaluated the effect of gender on irbesartan pharmacokinetics. Results showed that there were no significant gender effects on Cmax, AUC, or the terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan. Even though women generally had higher Cmax, tmax, and AUC values compared with men, these differences were not statistically significant or clinically relevant.29 Furthermore, no gender-related dosage adjustment was found to be necessary.30 The evaluation of age on irbesartan pharmacokinetics was similarly of no statistical significance. Healthy elderly male and female subjects (aged 65–80 years) had approximately 20%–25% higher AUC and Cmax values compared with healthy young (18–40 years) subjects.29,30 Concerning the effects of race on irbesartan pharmacokinetics, data from two single-dose pharmacokinetic studies showed that there were no statistically significant differences in Cmax, AUC, or terminal elimination half-life between healthy black and healthy white normotensive subjects, although the mean values for AUC and terminal elimination halflife were 25% and 21% higher, respectively, in blacks.29,30 Studies in pediatric hypertensive patients are limited, but an open-label evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan in children (aged 1–12 years) and adolescents (aged 13–16 years) showed that the plasma concentration-time profile s of irbesartan were comparable between children and adolescents.29,31
Renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, did not influence the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan.32 In a open-label, parallel-group study comparing irbesartan pharmacokinetics between patients with hepatic cirrhosis and normotensive subjects, there were no statistically significant differences in Cmax, AUC, or terminal elimination half-life between these groups after single or multiple doses of irbesartan.33 Finally, an evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan in an open-label, randomized, two-way, crossover study showed no significant differences in mean values of Cmax between heart failure patients and control subjects after oral administration of irbesartan.34
Studies reveal that there are no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), warfarin, nifedipine, or simvastatin. More specifically, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of oral irbesartan administration on the steady-state pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of warfarin, results showed no clinically important effect of irbesartan on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin during concomitant administration.35 In an open-label crossover study assessing the effect of irbesartan on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin in healthy subjects, irbesartan had no significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of total simvastatin acid.36 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, results showed that the pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not affected by addition of HCTZ.37 Finally, irbesartan does not affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nifedipine during concomitant administration, as shown in an open-label, crossover study in healthy subjects.38
In terms of pharmacodynamics, irbesartan is a potent, orally active, selective angiotensin II receptor type AT1 antagonist that blocks all actions of angiotensin II mediated by the AT1 receptor, regardless of the source or route of synthesis of angiotensin II. Irbesartan has the ability to inhibit the pressor response to exogenously administered angiotensin II in normotensive subjects and had a dose-related BP response as shown in several studies.39–41 Irbesartan inhibited the pressor response by up to 100% at peak after 4 hours of oral doses at 25–300 mg.40,41 Compared with losartan and valsartan in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four-way crossover study, the degree and duration of angiotensin II receptor blockade induced by 150 mg of irbesartan was significantly greater than with either 50 mg of losartan or 80 mg of valsartan.39 Furthermore, in studies evaluating its efficacy in hypertensive patients, chronic doses of up to 300 mg had no effect of clinical importance on renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, or urinary excretion of sodium and potassium.42–44 Also, irbesartan in multiple doses in hypertensive patients does not affect serum uric acid during chronic administration, fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, or fasting glucose concentrations.19
Concerning the tolerability and safety of irbesartan, the results from placebo-controlled studies show that irbesartan treatment is well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The overall incidence of adverse events with irbesartan was comparable with that of placebo; the most common adverse events experienced with irbesartan were weakness, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain.16,45,46 There were no significant differences between irbesartan and enalapril in the overall incidence of adverse events. Adverse events were mild in general and occurred much less frequently in patients on irbesartan treatment.19,47–49 Major adverse reactions were headache, malaise, and dizziness. The incidence of cough with irbesartan and enalapril was 10% and 17%, respectively.19 Results from another study concerning the incidence of drug-related cough though, show an even more significant difference between enalapril (18%) and irbesartan (0%).47 Comparing irbesartan with atenolol, the incidence of overall adverse events was similar with both treatments; however, irbesartan had no negative impact on heart rate in contrast with atenolol, which significantly lowered mean heart rate. The most common adverse events were fatigue, cold sensation, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, headache, somnolence, and musculoskeletal pain.20 Irbesartan compared with amlodipine and valsartan had a similar incidence of adverse events.50,51
Finally, in two studies comparing irbesartan with losartan treatment, the percentage of patients experiencing adverse events was not significantly different between treatment groups. Also, there were no significant differences in mean change in heart rate from baseline at any time point.45,52 Early discontinuations because of adverse events were not considerably different between irbesartan 300 mg and placebo.45 Concerning the safety and tolerability of a combination antihypertensive therapy, the addition of irbesartan to HCTZ, a thiazide-type diuretic, was in general well tolerated, as evident from several studies. Compared with placebo/HCTZ, the frequency of adverse events reported within the first 24 hours after initiation of double-blind therapy was similar between the treatment groups.53 The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting, and had slightly higher incidences with an irbesartan/HCTZ combination compared with placebo/HCTZ.54 Long-term treatment with irbesartan/HCTZ did not have a negative effect on tolerability or safety.55
In the I-ADD (Irbesartan/Amlodipine in Hypertensive Patients Uncontrolled on Irbesartan 150 mg Monotherapy) study comparing the efficacy and safety profile of irbesartan/amlodipine combination therapy with irbesartan monotherapy, most treatment emergent adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity and only a few were considered severe. The most frequent adverse events were peripheral edema and edema leading to treatment discontinuation; however, these were associated with amlodipine treatment only and appeared at the beginning of study treatment. Mean values for potassium, sodium, and creatinine were similar on both fixed-dose combination and monotherapy treatments.56 The tolerability and safety profile was similar in the I-COMBINE (Irbesartan/Amlodipine in Hypertensive Patients Uncontrolled on Amlodipine 5 mg Monotherapy) study between the irbesartan/amlodipine fixed-dose combination versus amlodipine monotherapy treatments.57 In COSIMA (the COmparative Study of Efficacy of Irbesartan/HCTZ with Valsartan/HCTZ Using Home Blood Pressure Monitoring in the TreAtment of Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension), which compared irbesartan/HCTZ with valsartan/HCTZ, overall safety was similar in the two groups.58 The most common adverse events were infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders, mild-to-moderate in intensity, and in most cases not related to the study drug.
Finally, in a study comparing the efficacy of fixed combinations of irbesartan/HCTZ and losartan/HCTZ, no differences were observed between the two treatments with respect to adverse events or tolerability. The most common adverse events were cold symptoms and sore throat on the irbesartan/HCTZ regimen and headache in the losartan/HCTZ regimen. Also, for the irbesartan/HCTZ combination, heart rate was not considerably different from baseline based on 24-hour, daytime, and night-time pulse rate data, whereas with losartan/HCTZ heart rate was significant greater than baseline for the mean 24-hour and daytime values.59
Irbesartan is primarily indicated for the treatment of hypertension with proven efficacy in achieving significant BP reductions. There are several published studies (Table 1) demonstrating the efficacy of irbesartan for the treatment of patients with essential, mild-to-moderate and severe hypertension, both as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ and other antihypertensive agents. The majority of the studies involved patients with seated diastolic BP of 95–110 mmHg,16,19,20,47,49–51,60,61 while others used limits of 95–100 mmHg,17,45 90–110 mmHg,46,48,62 95–115 mmHg,52 90–120 mmHg,63 or 115–130 mmHg.18 The primary efficacy outcome measure was reduction in trough seated BP in the majority of the included studies and reduction in trough 24-hour ambulatory BP in four studies.16,48,50,60
The main exclusion criteria in general concerned patients with secondary or malignant hypertension, cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, renal failure or liver dysfunction, other concomitant diseases presenting safety hazards, and medications that could interface with the assessment of efficacy or safety.
Results from placebo-controlled studies show that irbesartan treatment, at doses ranging from 75 mg to 300 mg, achieves a statistically significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic BP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.16,17,46 BP reductions were evident within 2 weeks with irbesartan treatment, although even greater reductions appeared in week 4 and thereafter, and were dose-related up to 300 mg per day. In comparative studies, irbesartan 300 mg in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension resulted in greater reductions in trough seated diastolic BP and systolic BP compared with losartan.45,52 Further, irbesartan demonstrated significant greater reductions in mean systolic ambulatory BP, at trough, mean 24-hour diastolic and systolic ambulatory BP, as well as office-measured diastolic BP and systolic BP compared with valsartan.50 Compared with enalapril, atenolol, and amlodipine, irbesartan demonstrated comparable efficacy in reducing both diastolic and systolic blood pressure and normalized seated diastolic BP at dosages up to 300 mg.19,20,47–49,51 Finally, in a study by Oparil et al, irbesartan compared with the newest angiotensin II antagonist, olmesartan, showed similar reductions in ambulatory BP, as well as in seated systolic BP. However olmesartan achieved significant greater reductions in seated diastolic BP than irbesartan.63
In many cases, hypertensive patients require the addition of a second drug to achieve adequate BP control. The literature search identified several studies evaluating the efficacy of irbesartan combined with HCTZ for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate or severe hypertension. Primary efficacy outcomes and exclusion criteria for patients were similar to the ones mentioned above. Patients’ seated diastolic BP in the majority of the studies was 95–110 mmHg,53–58,64–74 while others used limits of 70–109 mmHg,75 95–114 mmHg,59 or 100–109 mmHg.76
Results from three placebo-controlled studies showed that reductions from baseline trough seated diastolic BP and systolic BP with irbesartan/HCTZ combination were greater compared with placebo/HCTZ. Results were obvious within 2 weeks of treatment with irbesartan/HCTZ.53–55 Similarly, the INCLUSIVE (IrbesartaN/HCTZ bLood pressUre reductionS in dIVErse patient populations) trial as well as subgroup analyses of this trial showed that irbesartan/HCTZ combination therapy leads to substantial reductions in both systolic BP (in more than 75% of patients uncontrolled on monotherapy) and diastolic BP.66,74,75
In comparative studies, the fixed combination of irbesartan/HCTZ had a superior BP-lowering effect compared with valsartan/HCTZ, and there was a significant difference in adjusted mean changes from baseline 24-hour ambulatory diastolic BP and systolic BP compared with losartan/HCTZ.58,59 Further, in patients with severe hypertension (ie, seated diastolic BP ≥ 110 mmHg), irbesartan/HCTZ resulted in greater and more rapid reductions in BP, compared with irbesartan 150 mg or 300 mg and HCTZ 12.5 mg or 25 mg monotherapies.68–70,73 Finally, results from the I-ADD and the I-COMBINE studies, which evaluated the efficacy of irbesartan/amlodipine combination therapy, suggest greater efficacy with the fixed-dose combination of irbesartan 150 mg/amlodipine 5 mg over amlodipine 5 mg and irbesartan 150 mg monotherapies.56,57
Irbesartan is also indicated for the treatment of renal disease in adult hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results from the IDNT (Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial) and IRMA (Irbesartan in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Microalbuminuria) trials show that irbesartan was associated with better renal outcomes compared with amlodipine, placebo, and other antihypertensive agents. Further, irbesartan provided a significantly slower increase in serum creatinine concentration and decrease in creatinine clearance and reduced the rate of progression to albuminuria (by 38% and 24% with irbesartan 300 mg and 150 mg, respectively).77,78
Irbesartan was also found to reduce microalbuminuria both in diabetic and nondiabetic patients, resulting in an increase in the percentage of patients with normoalbuminuria from 17.1% at baseline to 40.9% and in a decrease in patients with microalbuminuria from 49.2% to 23.2%.79,80 Finally, irbesartan was found to reduce significantly the albumin excretion rate in both microalbuminuric normotensive and hypertensive patients as well as 24-hour mean systolic and diastolic BP.81
Left ventricular hypertrophy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension, and there are several studies investigating the potential effects of irbesartan in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.82–85 In the SILVHIA (Swedish Irbesartan Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Investigation versus Atenolol) trial, patients treated with irbesartan showed a greater reduction in left ventricular mass and BP than those treated with atenolol. Irbesartan decreased QT dispersion from 56 ± 24 msec to 45 ± 20 msec at 48 weeks and QTc dispersion from 57 ± 24 msec to 44 ± 19 msec.83 Similarly, the effect of irbesartan 150 mg once daily in patients with essential arterial hypertension and echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy showed a decrease by 23.2% and 24.7% in left ventricular mass index compared with a decrease of 11.4% and 11.6% with amlodipine (after 3 months and 6 months, respectively).82
The literature review identified 15 papers eligible for inclusion in the review concerning the cost-effectiveness of irbesartan. More specifically, 13 studies compared the cost-effectiveness of irbesartan with standard antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, valsartan, losartan), while the other two assessed the cost-effectiveness of irbesartan in combination with HCTZ. The studies are presented in Table 2 and the results are summarized under the following headings: study reference, analysis perspective, methods, population, time horizon, discounting rate, costs, outcomes, and study conclusions. The majority of the studies based their efficacy data on two clinical trials, ie, IDNT and IRMA-2. All studies were modeling ones, using a Markov model, with the majority being cost-effectiveness analyses86–94 or cost-consequence analyses,95–99 while one was a cost utility analysis.100 Studies were done either from a third party payer perspective or from a health care payer perspective. The population under consideration included patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria, and nephropathy. The majority of the studies were conducted in a European setting (France, Belgium, the UK, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, and Sweden), while two were conducted in the US, two in Canada, and another one in Asia.
In many of the studies, there are extrapolations on the long-term life years gained and quality-adjusted years with irbesartan. In four studies comparing irbesartan with amlodipine treatment, results concerning effectiveness showed that life expectancy improved with irbesartan compared with amlodipine. Life expectancy for irbesartan was 8.58 life years in a 25-year time horizon versus 8.13 life years with amlodipine.88,91,94–96 Five studies comparing early versus late irbesartan treatment showed that early irbesartan is more effective than late irbesartan.86,87,92,98,100 Life years gained with irbesartan were 12.17 versus 11.27 with late irbesartan treatment. The quality-adjusted life years gained were 10.55 and 9.58, respectively.100 Further, several studies indicated an association between irbesartan treatment and delayed onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Results showed that use of irbesartan delayed the onset of ESRD and reduced the cumulative incidence of ESRD apart from increasing life expectancy. The cumulative incidence of ESRD after 25 years for irbesartan compared with control therapy was 10.7%–26.6%, respectively. Irbesartan was estimated to delay the onset of ESRD by 2.14 years.97
Results concerning the cost-effectiveness of irbesartan monotherapy compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy reveal that treatment of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria, and nephropathy with irbesartan lead to significant cost savings. More specifically, total per patient costs with irbesartan ranged from approximately €14,000 to €93,000. Corresponding costs per patient with the comparison treatment ranged from approximately €20,000 to €120,000, resulting to substantial cost savings of up to about €20,000 with irbesartan treatment.
Four studies evaluated the cost-effectiveness of three alternative strategies for the management of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria; these alternative strategies were early irbesartan treatment, late irbesartan treatment, and conventional antihypertensive treatment.86,87,92,98 Results from these studies showed that early irbesartan treatment is cost-effective compared with late irbesartan treatment and conventional antihypertensive therapy, resulting to cost savings per patient of up to approximately €40,000 versus late irbesartan treatment and up to approximately €50,000 versus standard treatment.86,87,92,98
Two studies evaluating irbesartan in combination with HCTZ for the treatment of patients with hypertension showed that irbesartan is a cost-effective antihypertensive treatment strategy compared with alternative hypertension therapies, losartan and valsartan.89,90 More specifically, the combination of irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was a dominant strategy (ie, better health effects at lower costs) compared with losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and valsartan 80 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg.89
Evidence from this review suggests that irbesartan represents not only an effective and well tolerated treatment for patients with hypertension and those with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, but also a cost-saving and cost-effective treatment compared with other conventional treatment options.
