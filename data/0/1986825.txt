Elasticity imaging is a reconstructive imaging technique where tissue motion in response to mechanical excitation is measured using modern imaging systems, and the estimated displacements are then used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of Young's modulus. Here we present an ultrasound elasticity imaging method that utilizes the model-based technique for Young's modulus reconstruction. Based on the geometry of the imaged object, only one axial component of the strain tensor is used. The numerical implementation of the method is highly efficient because the reconstruction is based on an analytic solution of the forward elastic problem. The model-based approach is illustrated using two potential clinical applications: differentiation of liver hemangioma and staging of deep venous thrombosis. Overall, these studies demonstrate that model-based reconstructive elasticity imaging can be used in applications where the geometry of the object and the surrounding tissue is somewhat known and certain assumptions about the pathology can be made.

Elasticity imaging or elastography is a method to remotelyestimate elastic properties of biological tissues   [1–4].One of the approaches in elasticity imaging is based on themeasurement of local tissue deformation as tissue responds toexternal or internal quasi-static mechanic loading. Ultrasound,MRI, or other methods can be used to measure the resultantinternal tissue motion. Using inverse problem formulations, theelasticity (Young's modulus) distribution is evaluated based onthe distribution of the strain tensor components. Initially,elasticity imaging was focused on the noninvasive cancerdiagnosis, but then the approach proved to be useful in variousother applications including detection of atherosclerotic plaques[5, 6], corneal refractive surgery [7], cardiac strainimaging [8], muscle biomechanics [9], and so forth.
Once the internal tissue motion is measured, the strain image inthe tissue can be produced. Usually hard tissue regions are lessdeformed in comparison with soft regions and, therefore, contrastin strain images is influenced by the tissue elasticity. However,the strain field depends not only on the elastic distribution, butalso on global boundary conditions which can be very complicatedin real tissues. As a result, the relationship between strainimage and elasticity distribution in tissue is not straightforwardand reconstruction of Young's modulus is required to determinetissue elasticity quantitatively. Elastic modulus reconstructionin an inhomogeneous material using remote measurements of internaldisplacements can be posed in a number of ways[10–18]. These approaches can begenerally grouped into two categories: direct and indirect(model-based) reconstruction techniques. If all necessarycomponents of the internal displacement vector and strain tensorare available at any point within the object, then reconstructionalgorithms based on the mechanical equilibrium equations can beused to describe the unknown distribution of Young's or shearmodulus—these techniques, therefore, belong to direct reconstruction methods. Unfortunately,  in direct reconstructionmethods, it is often difficult to formulate and solve the inverseproblem for an arbitrary geometry and elasticity distribution.However, if any prior knowledge or assumptions about the geometryof the object and boundary conditions can be made, the inverseproblem can be solved by using repeated solutions of forwardproblems with adjusted elasticity parameters. Indeed, ifelasticity variations of the object within the region of interestcan be modeled based on the object geometry or any otherassumptions, then a model-based reconstruction can be performed.Therefore, the model-based elasticity imaging methods could beuseful in applications where the existence of the pathology isalready determined from the imaging study and pathologycharacterization rather than detection is required. In such cases,the approximate location and geometry of the pathology is knownand certain assumption about tissue elasticity distribution can bemade. Note here, that both direct and model-based approachesprovide information only about relative elasticity distribution.For absolute Young's modulus reconstruction, either referencepoint or measurements of stress are required.
Ultrasound is widely used in elasticity imaging since motion ofthe speckle can be tracked over large range of tissuedeformations. However, the accuracy of the lateral displacementestimates is less accurate than axial component of thedisplacement vector. Indeed, for an ultrasound system, theresolution of axial displacement is limited primarily by thefrequency bandwidth of the transducer, and the lateral resolutionis determined by the width of the ultrasound beam [19, 20].Since all displacement components and spatial derivatives areneeded in direct reconstruction methods, the anisotropy in theaccuracy of the displacement vector measurements is an additionalsource of noise in elasticity images. In contrast, model-basedapproaches can be formulated using only axial component of thedisplacement vector to insure that the quality of Young's modulusreconstruction is independent from the quality of lateral motiontracking.
Here we present the model-based elasticity imaging approachillustrated using two potential clinical applications:characterization of liver hemangiomas and differentiation of deepvenous thrombi (DVT). For liver hemangioma, the spherical symmetryof the lesion was assumed, and for DVT a blood clot was describedas a cylindrically symmetry object. In both cases, the externalsurface deformations were applied during continuous ultrasoundimaging, and the measurements of tissue motion were performedusing block-matching cross-correlation technique. Based on themeasured strain images, the Young's modulus was reconstructed.These studies demonstrate that model-based reconstructiveelasticity imaging can be used in applications where the geometryof the object and the surrounding tissue is assessable and certainassumptions about the pathology can be made from the ultrasoundimages.
The model-based elasticity reconstruction technique is performedin two successive steps. First, the analytical solution of theforward elastic problem is derived where the displacement andstrain fields are determined based on the spatial distribution ofYoung's modulus in the object and pattern of externally applieddeformation. Second, the inverse problem is solved iteratively,where the solution of the forward problem for a modeled object iscompared with experimentally measured strains to match the unknownspatial distribution of Young's modulus in a region of interest(ROI). The Young's modulus distribution providing the bestagreement is assumed to describe the distribution of elasticproperties in the region of interest.
The formulation of a forward problem is based on a uniaxialdeformation of an infinite, incompressible medium with sphericalor cylindrically shaped inhomogeneities. Here, we consider onlyincompressible media since most soft tissues are very close toincompressible materials [21]. The forward problem isformulated in a spherical system of coordinates(r, φ, θ)  for spherical inclusions and in cylindricalcoordinates (r, φ, z)  for cylindrical inclusions. Theorigins of the coordinate systems are placed at the centers of theinhomogeneities. The polar axis of both systems of coordinates is along an applied deformation, that is, an angle ϕ is betweena radius vector and the deformation direction (seeFigure 1). It is assumed that Young's modulus E(r)is a function of only radial position. To find the solution offorward problem for arbitrary Young's modulus E(r) over an ROI,we presume that the Young's modulus is constant within eachsubinterval [ri, ri + 1], that is, E(r) :Ei = const, r ∈ [ri, ri + 1],  i = 1 ⋯ N, where N  is the totalnumber of subintervals covering the region of interest [22].The displacement vector U→ must satisfy the equations ofstatic equilibrium for isotropic incompressible linear medium oneach subinterval [ri, ri + 1] [23]:            	(1)μ∇2U→+∇p=0,            	 where p  is static internal pressure and μ is shear elasticmodulus. For incompressible media, the shear modulus and Young'smodulus are related (μ = E/3), and only one modulus (μ or E) is sufficient to describe the elastic properties of the material. In addition, the incompressibility condition must besatisfied: div U→ = 0.
Based on Goodier's solution [24, 25], we attempt to find thesolution of (1) under the assumption of sphericalsymmetry (3D case) in the form         	 (2)ur=14Vr(r)[1+3cos⁡(2ϕ)],      uθ=0,uϕ=Vϕ(r)sin⁡(2ϕ),p=P0(r)+P1(r)[1+3cos⁡(2ϕ)],         	where the displacement vector components areU→ = (ur, uφ, uθ).
Similarly, solution of (1) under the assumption ofcylindrical symmetry (2D case) can be found in the following form:        	 (3)ur=Vr(r)cos⁡(2ϕ),uϕ=Vϕ(r)sin⁡(2ϕ),uz=0,p=P0(r)+P1(r)cos⁡(2ϕ),            	where the components of the displacement vector areU→ = (ur, uφ, uz).
Using the incompressibility condition, the relationships betweenthe Vr(r) and Vφ(r) are        	 (4)Vϕ=−14(2Vr+r∂Vr∂r),    for 3D,Vϕ=−12(Vr+r∂Vr∂r),    for 2D.
Substituting expressions (2)–(4) into(1) and eliminating the pressure, we find Vr(r):           (5)Vr=c1ir+c2ir3+c3ir−2+c4ir−4,    for 3D,Vr=c1ir+c2ir3+c3ir−1+c4ir−3,    for 3D.
Arbitrary constants  c1i, c2i, c3i, c4i vary foreach [ri, ri + 1] layer. These unknown constants can be foundusing boundary conditions and the stress and displacementcontinuity conditions at the boundaries of each layer. To satisfyboundary conditions for (1), the displacements urand uφ must be zero at r = 0 (the solution is limited atthe center of the system of coordinates), and must match thestrains applied at infinity. For uniaxial loading, the condition       (6)lim⁡r→∞Vr(r)r=ε0must be satisfied, where  ε0 is axial strain atinfinity. For homogeneous media, the solution of spherical andcylindrical problems (5) is the same linear functionVr(r) = ε0⋅r.
Hence, the solution of (1) for a specific elasticitydistribution can be reduced to the solution of a linear system ofalgebraic equations. This fact allows us to simplify and to speedup the solution of the forward problem and, as a result, toconstruct an effective procedure for inverse problem solution.
The inverse problem was formulated using a Cartesian system ofcoordinates since a linear array ultrasound probe was used tomeasure the internal displacements and the ultrasound images wereinherently obtained in a Cartesian system of coordinates (x, y, z)as evident from the ultrasound and strain images presented inFigure 2. Therefore, the analytical solutions of theforward problems formulated in spherical and cylindrical systemsof coordinates were converted to a Cartesian system ofcoordinates. By pushing the ultrasound transducer against theskin, the external surface deformations we applied were such thatthe ultrasound beam is along the direction of applied deformation.
In ultrasound strain imaging, the quality of axial strainestimates (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio and resolution) is higherthan that of other strain tensor components [19, 20].Therefore, it is desired to construct the inverse problem solutionusing only one experimentally measured axial component of thestrain tensor ɛyy = ∂uy/∂ y, whereuy is the axial component of the displacement vector inCartesian coordinates.
The theoretical distribution of axial strain in the region ofinterest can be computed when the following parameters are known:Young's moduli over a set of layers, the center of theinhomogeneity (x0, y0), and the effective deformation ɛ0 at infinity. Using the analytic solution of theforward problem and having experimentally measured the axialstrain component, the unknown Young's modulus Ei can beestimated by minimizing the error function, that is, thedifference between experimentally measured and theoreticallypredicted axial strains [22]:(7)δ=‖εyyexp⁡−εyytheory(Ei,ε0,x0,y0)‖.
In general, the deformation ɛ0 and the center(x0, y0) of the object can be considered unknown andestimated simultaneously with the unknown distribution of theYoung's modulus Ei by minimizing the error function.Alternatively, the applied deformation ɛ0 and thecenter (x0, y0) of the object can be derived based on somea priori information.
Hence, elasticity reconstruction reduces to a minimization of theerror function of (7) with respect to the unknownelasticity distribution, the geometry of the object, and thedetails of external loading.
To minimize (7), a gradient-based iterative procedurewas implemented [22, 26]. The step size of the gradient methodwas chosen based on three estimates of error function δThe minimum of the error function was locally predicted using asecond-order polynomial approximation of  δ as a functionof the unknown parameters under the restriction of a decreasingerror. Then, a global linear prediction for all unknowns was usedsimultaneously to increase the rate of convergence, that is,iterative step sizes for the gradient method were chosen takinginto account the second-order polynomial approximation of δas a function of unknown parameters. This iterative process doesnot require any additional derivatives of displacement or strainand, therefore, compared to direct elasticity reconstructionmethods, does not introduce additional noise associated withhigher-order derivatives of the displacement vector and straintensor components. The high computational speed is achieved byusing the analytical solution to calculate forward problem withonly a small number of unknown parameters.
Hemangioma is the most prevalent benign tumor of the liver,occurring in up to 70% of the population. Hemangiomas can vary insize and be as large as several centimeters. These tumors arefilled with vascular channels of various sizes and may alsocontain fibrous tissue. Thrombi (clotted blood) may be present inthe vascular channels. Histologically, the hemangioma ischaracterized by large, thin-walled blood vessels completelyfilled with blood [27].
These asymptomatic lesions are often found incidentally onultrasound or CT when imaging studies are undertaken for otherreasons. Once diagnosed, no treatment is necessary, and onlylarge, symptomatic hemangiomata are treated by surgical resection.The diagnosis of hemangioma, however, requires special imagingstudies such as nuclear medicine scans using radioactivetechnicium tagged red blood cells, magnetic resonance or dynamicCT scans with contrast.
Liver hemangiomas can be clearly identified in the ultrasoundB-Scan image as a hyperechoic region, and the margins of the tumorare usually well defined. However, routine ultrasound issuggestive but usually not diagnostic. Many other tumors in liver,some of which are malignant, may appear similar on the B-Scan.Therefore, there is a need to specifically diagnose a detectedliver mass in the least invasive and most time/cost efficient wayavailable.
In the literature, hemangiomas are often referred to as softlesions filled with blood [27]. Therefore, elasticity imagingmay help in the diagnosis of hemangiomas. Indeed, most solidtumors are usually harder than the background, so hemangiomas maybe distinguished from other liver tumors based on their mechanicalproperties.
To test the hypothesis that elasticity imaging can detect anddiagnose hemangiomas, studies on volunteers with previouslydiagnosed hemangioma were performed. All subjects gave informedconsent, and this study was approved by the University of MichiganInstitutional Review Board. In these experiments, the liver wasimaged between the ribs using an Ultramark-9 ATL scanner with alinear 128-element array transducer operating at 5 MHz. Thesystem was interfaced with a custom-made circuit board to acquireapproximately 120 frames of real-time digital RF signals during 4seconds. Within this interval, the array, attached to adeformational device residing on a clinical trolley (gurney), waspressed against the body to produce a modest deformation of theliver. In most experiments, surface deformations did not exceed10–12 mm, and all volunteers indicated no discomfort from theapplied stress.
In all experiments, frame-to-frame motion was estimated using atwo-dimensional correlation-based phase-sensitive speckle trackingtechnique [28]. The 2D displacement was estimated fromthe position of the maximum correlation coefficient, where theaxial displacement estimate was refined using the position of thephase zero crossing of the analytic signal correlation.Displacement error was further reduced by filtering spatiallyadjacent correlation functions prior to displacement estimation[28].
The ultrasound B-Scan image of a liver hemangioma is presented inFigure 2(a). This image is a typical example ofhemangiomas, where the location, margins, and size of the tumorare clearly identified. Furthermore, the muscle layers can beeasily recognized at the top. This and other images inFigure 2 are 38-mm by 78-mm, where the transducer islocated at the top of the image.
The distribution of the normal axial strain (ɛyy)is shown in Figure 2(b). This quantitative grayscaleimage is displayed from 0 to 10 percent strain, where full blackcorresponds to no strain and full white to 10% strain. The tumoris clearly visible as a low strain region indicating that overallit is harder than the background tissue.
Similar results were obtained from several other volunteers. Theapparent overall hardness of a hemangioma, inferred from thestrain image, is unexpected given the soft interior of the tumor.However, this result is consistent with information gathered bysurgeons in the operating room—when large, symptomatichemangiomata are treated by  surgical resection, the intacthemangiomas are felt as hard lesions. Pressure applied to thehemangioma, however, ruptures it, releasing blood as it collapses.Therefore, a hemangioma feels hard even it is filled with blood,which has no or low-shear elasticity.
In general, a soft, fluid-filled sack can appear hard if it isencapsulated by a very hard, thin membrane. If the mechanicalproperties of the shell are similar to that of the lesion, theshell itself would not affect the strain pattern. If the shell isharder than the lesion, however, the strain magnitude inside ofthe lesion is reduced. In fact, for an infinitely hard andabsolutely noncompliant shell, the strain inside of the lesionvanishes regardless of the internal material properties.Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the thin membraneencapsulating a hemangioma is significantly harder than thelesion's core, and dominates the overall strain pattern within thetumor. The mechanical properties of the shell surrounding a lesioncan significantly impact the strain distribution. In particular,the strain images of a heterogeneous lesion surrounded by a hardshell and a uniform hard inclusion appear very similar. It may bepossible, however, to estimate the lesion composition in bothcases using reconstructive elasticity imaging.
For elasticity imaging of hemangiomas, the mapping of Young'smodulus was performed using two approaches: direct reconstructionand model-based reconstruction. Direct reconstruction numericallysolves the discretized equilibrium equations for a plane straincondition [10]. The plane strain condition is a reasonableapproximation for elasticity imaging of the liver, wheredeformations are applied through the rib cage resulting innegligible out-of-plane strains. This method does not require anya priori knowledge of the object, and no other assumptions aremade. After defining a region of interest containing the lesion,the Young's modulus distribution is reconstructed relative to themodulus of the background tissue (i.e., liver).
In model-based approach we assume that the hemangioma can bemodeled as a spherical object such that the elastic modulus withinthe imaging plane is simply a function of radial position from thecenter of the tumor. For a realistic tumor, this is a reasonableapproximation if the tumor is near no external boundaries.Nevertheless, by assuming a simple model such as this, themodel-based reconstruction in the vicinity of the tumor core isfar less susceptible to strain noise compared to direct elasticityreconstruction.
The results of the elasticity reconstruction are presented inFigure 3. In Figure 3(a), a 17.5-mm by17.5-mm region of interest (ROI) of grayscale ultrasound imagecontaining the hemangioma is shown. In direct reconstructionmethod (see Figure 3(b)), the Young's modulus along theROI boundary was set to unity, resulting in reconstruction of theYoung's modulus relative to liver. Clearly, the overall hemangiomais harder than the background tissue, but it has a softer interiorpart. This distribution is better depicted in the model-basedelasticity image (see Figure 3(c)), where the softerinterior part can be easily identified. In model-basedreconstruction, the hemangioma was initially modeled as ahomogeneous spherical inclusion, that is, object with one layeronly. For a given number of layers, the relative Young's modulus,the external load ɛ0 and position of hemangiomacenter (x0, y0) were reconstructed by minimizing the errorfunction (7) across the ROI.
The Young's modulus distributions along the horizontal lineintersecting the center of the hemangioma are contrasted inFigure 4 indicating reasonable agreement between thetwo different reconstruction approaches. In model-basedreconstruction approach, only 12 layers were used to describehemangioma. The results in Figures 3 and 4correspond closely to the expected elasticity distribution withinthe hemangioma, where the capsule surrounding the tumor makes thelesion harder overall. Reconstructive elasticity imaging capturesthe complex composition of such tumors.
The results of this study suggest that diagnosis of liverhemangioma may be possible with reconstructive elasticity imaging.Strain imaging by itself may not be sufficient to differentiatehemangioma from other types of liver tumors since all lesionsoverall can produce somewhat similar strain images. In contrast,the reconstructed elasticity map may capture the criticaldifferences between the tumors.
The leading cause of preventable in-hospital mortality in the USAand other developed countries is pulmonary embolism (PE), which isone of the complications of deep venous thrombosis [29]. DVToccurs when the blood clot forms inside a deep vein (commonlylocated in the calf or thigh) and either partially or completelyblocks the flow of blood in the vein. In pulmonary embolism, aportion of the thrombus detaches from the vessel wall and travelsthrough the veins into the lung. When large emboli lodge in themain pulmonary artery, pulmonary embolism can quickly becomefatal. The level of pulmonary embolism risk and DVT treatmentdepend on the age of the clot (in this paper, we often refer toDVT as blood clot). For an acute thrombus, the patient is at ahigher risk of the clot breaking off and becoming an embolus. Thispatient is treated with heparin followed by oral anticoagulants.Patients with chronic DVT are treated with either oralanticoagulants, coumadin, alone, or no treatment [30].Because the risk of bleeding is higher with heparin than withcoumadin, one would like to avoid the use of heparin if at allpossible [31]. Therefore it is clinically important todistinguish between acute and chronic DVT.
Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and duplex ultrasound cantell whether a thrombus is present [32, 33]. The problem isthat while these technologies can identify the blood clot in thevein, they cannot determine its age. Studies suggest that elasticproperties of clot can be used to determine DVT maturity[22, 34–41]. This is based on the assumptionthat the Young's modulus of a thrombus changes monotonically withfibrin and collagen concentration. Since both the fibrin andcollagen content of a thrombus increase over time, DVT hardenswith age. Consequently, remote estimation of the elasticproperties of a thrombus can become an important clinical tool toage DVT.
The examination employs real-time B-mode sonography (2D grayscaleultrasound imaging) combined with color flow Doppler imaging andcompression ultrasound. During the compression ultrasound, atransverse view of the veins and arteries of the patient's leg isimaged. The operator periodically pushes on the surface of theleg to deform the underlying tissue including vein and artery.  Ifthe vein does not deform while the adjacent artery does, the clotis suspected [33]. Since compression ultrasound already hasall of the essential ingredients of elasticity imaging (i.e.,external deformation of the object during continuous ultrasoundimaging), elasticity imaging is a simple addition to the existingprocedure of DVT diagnosis [36].
Animal studies were performed using a rat model of stasis-induced-venous thrombosis [37, 38, 42, 43]. The protocol wasapproved by the University of Michigan Committee on the use andcare of animals and strictly complied with the National Institutesof Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. Agroup of five rats were used in this study although only fouranimals developed thrombi. On the first day, all rats underwentsurgery to initiate thrombus formation in the inferior vena cava(IVC). As the animals developed thrombi, which changedprogressively from acute to chronic stages [42], each rat wasimaged on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10.
All experiments were performed using a Siemens “Elegra”ultrasound scanner with a linear 12 MHz array transducer(VFX13-5). First, the IVCs were scanned in transverse andlongitudinal orientations using color Doppler mode to determinethrombus location and find the best possible probe position on therat's abdomen. Next, the transducer itself was used to compressthe rat's abdominal wall and underlying tissue in a transverseorientation. It was attached to a manual deformation device toachieve continuous compression. The deformation lastedapproximately 6 seconds, while phase sensitive ultrasoundframes were collected in real time. Consecutive frames wereprocessed offline using a 2D correlation-based phase-sensitivespeckle tracking algorithm to derive the strain image of the DVTand surrounding tissue [28]. A kernel size 0.60-mm laterallyby 0.17-mm axially was chosen for cross-correlation. Thecorrelation function was filtered by a Hanning filter extending1.20-mm laterally by 0.85-mm axially. Finally, frame-to-framedisplacements were accumulated over a number of frames within thesame deformation sequence and axial strains were calculatednumerically.
An analysis of the B-scan in the thrombus area (seeFigure 5) was the starting point of elasticityreconstruction for each animal. Based on the ultrasound image, theROIs for elasticity reconstruction and the position of the clotcenter (x0,  y0) were chosen. Each ROI was selected suchthat it included the IVC and a small portion of surrounding tissue(see Figure 6) to minimize elasticity variations ofbackground tissue. The elasticity reconstruction program createsrelative Young's modulus images—the stress distribution at thesurface in response to surface-applied deformations is requiredfor absolute reconstruction. Therefore, a vessel wall was used asthe reference material, that is, Young's modulus of the vesselwall was assigned unity value.
A slight modification of described method was used for DVTelasticity reconstruction. We assume that the external load isapplied at an angle α relative to the axial direction ofan ultrasound beam. The angle α was added to expression(7) as a parameter of minimization. The details arepresented elsewhere [22]. Based onthe geometry of the thrombus, vessel, and surrounding tissue(Figure 1), the clot-containing vessel is modeled as along round cylinder. At the beginning of the reconstruction, ahomogeneous cylindrical clot was assumed. The position of the clotcenter (x0, y0) was manually set based on the ultrasoundimage.
Once the solution for a given number of rings was found, thenumber of rings required to represent the object was increased.The previous elasticity distribution and load parameters αand ɛ0 were used (after interpolation) as theinitial point for the next step, where thrombus, vessel wall, andsurrounding tissue were approximated using more independent ringsof different elasticity. This iterative process was continueduntil the difference between two successive reconstructions (i.e.,Young's modulus reconstructions for a different number of layers)was less then 2%. In the final Young's modulus map, the number oflayers ranged from 30 to 40 depending on a particular dataset.
A typical B-scan image of a rat's abdomen with 5-day old thrombusis shown in Figure 5. This image covers 10-mm (axial)by 8.5-mm (lateral) region. Using color-flow imaging, the arteryadjacent to the IVC was identified while no flow was detected inthe IVC signaling that the thrombus occluded the vessel. On thebottom of the B-scan, the anterior surface of the spine can alsobe noted. Figure 6 presents the results of model-basedelasticity reconstruction for the same rat. The 4.5-mm by 4.5-mmelasticity reconstruction region (Figure 6(a), alsooutlined rectangular area in Figure 5) was chosen toinclude the entire IVC, with the clot located in the center, and asmall portion of background tissue. The measured axial strainimage is presented in Figure 6(b). This image isdisplayed over a 0 to 18% strain dynamic range, where full whiterepresents no strain, and full black represents a normal axialstrain magnitude of 18% and larger (negative strain indicatesthat vein size was reduced vertically during the deformation).
Once the region of interest was identified, iterative elasticityreconstruction was performed, where the experimentally measuredaxial strain distribution   ɛyyexp was comparedwith the theoretically predicted axial strain mapɛyytheory to minimize the error function(7). The resultant Young's modulus distribution  Eiover a set of rings is presented in Figure 6(c)  where agrayscale map is used to display the relative Young's modulus overthe 0.5 to 1.0 range. The grayscale map was selected so that fullblack corresponds to a relative Young's modulus of less than orequal to 0.5, and white areas represent harder tissue. Finally,Figure 6(d) presents the theoretically predicted axialstrain distribution corresponding to reconstructed values ofYoung's modulus in Figure 6(c).
The minimization process is illustrated in Figures 7 and 8. Figure 7 shows changes in relativeYoung's modulus during iterations. In this example, the number oflayers is fixed and equal to 5. The initial elasticity value wastaken from the previous step, where the number of layers was equalto 4. During each iteration, the minimization of the errorfunction (7) was performed. Regions of rapid change inelasticity (at iterations 5 and 25) correspond to successfulglobal linear prediction resulting in 5–10 times fasterconvergence. Figure 8 presents behavior of relativeelasticity of thrombus as the number of rings is increased. Theseresults illustrate that 30–40 rings are sufficient to describe theblood clot, vessel wall, and surrounding tissue for thisparticular experimental dataset since further increase in thenumber of rings does not change the final result.
Figure 9 contrasts relative Young's modulus profilesalong the center of thethrombus for one of the animals at 5, 8, and 10 days after thesurgery (the profile for 5-day old thrombus corresponds to resultspresented in Figures 5–8).Figure 10 presents the profiles of relative Young'smodulus for another animal with 4-day, 7-day, and 10-day oldthrombus. Note here, that position of vessel walls have changedthrough time because of the vessel shrank in process of clotformation [37, 38].
In this animal model, 3-day to 4-day old thrombus represents anacute DVT, 6-day to 7-day old thrombus represents a subacute DVT,and 10-day old thrombus represents a chronic DVT. The rate ofthrombus growth is different in humans, but the process of clotformation has the same stages. As the thrombus develops, itselasticity increases. This is further illustrated inFigure 11, where relative Young's modulus is plottedas function of time after surgery, that is, age of the thrombus.Here, the elasticity values were averaged for the four rats usedin our study. Clearly, the relative elasticity of the clotincreases with thrombus age suggesting that Young's modulus can beused to age DVT.
The results of in vivo elasticity reconstruction were comparedwith the results of ex vivo direct elasticity measurements[38]. A total of 59 Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. On days3, 6, 10, 12, and 14, the group of animals (9–13 animals) waseuthanized for the direct measurements of Young's modulus of theblood clots. Thrombi were removed from the dissected IVC andtransported immediately to the next room for mechanicalload-displacement measurements to accurately assess the Young'smodulus of the thrombi. Specifically, the displacement versusforce was measured while a test sample was subjected tocompression. Based on the strain-stress relationship and finiteelement modeling of the clot deformation, Young's modulus of thetest sample was estimated. Initially, the system was tested onrubber cylindrical sample with known elastic properties [38].The direct ex vivo elasticity measurements were performed using15–20% strain range. This range approximately corresponds to thestrain level used in ultrasound in vivo studies. InFigure 12, the mechanical, ex vivo measurements ofYoung's modulus are plotted as function of thrombus age.
Figures 11 and 12 demonstrate that the in vivoreconstruction agrees well with the ex vivo mechanicalmeasurement. The results of direct elasticity estimations andremote assessment of the clot elasticity indicate that a thrombushardens as it matures. Indeed, the Young's modulus of thrombiincreases over time, and a 10-day old thrombus is approximately3–6 times harder than a 3-day old thrombus.
Therefore, the model-based elasticity reconstruction approach isapplicable to an animal model of DVT. Indeed, thrombus elasticity(Young's modulus) increases with time and can be accuratelyassessed and monitored using quantitative model-basedreconstructive elasticity imaging.
The model-based elasticity reconstruction method was developed todemonstrate the potential of ultrasound-based reconstructiveelasticity imaging. The developed model-based method has severaladvantages compared to other elasticity reconstruction approaches.The model-based elasticity reconstruction requires only axialcomponent of the strain tensor. The minimization procedure inmodel-based reconstruction is relatively efficient and stablegiven the small number of unknown scalar parameters derived froman analytic solution of the forward elastic problem. Finally, themodel-based reconstruction is not highly sensitive to the detailsof external loading. The model-based reconstructive elasticityimaging was applied to differentiate liver hemangioma and to agedeep vein thrombosis. The results of our studies indicate that themodel-based reconstruction approach is applicable in ultrasound invivo elasticity imaging and can provide needed information aboutbiomechanical properties of tissues.
