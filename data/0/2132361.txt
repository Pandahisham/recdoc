THE EFFECT OF HEMOGLOBIN INJECTIONS ON ERYTHROPOIESIS AND ERYTHROCYTE SIZE IN RABBITS RENDERED ANEMIC BY BLEEDING

 1. An anemia characterized by increased size of the red blood cells and a high color index was produced in rabbits by repeated bleeding and by the subcutaneous injection of stroma-free hemoglobin solution. 2. The bone marrow of these rabbits reverted to a more primitive stage than did the marrows of rabbits rendered anemic in the same manner but not treated with hemoglobin.
