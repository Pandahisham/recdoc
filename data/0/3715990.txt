Lacrimal gland enlargement in acute myeloid leukemia


Sir,
An 18-year-old male got admitted to emergency room (ER) of our hospital, a tertiary care center, for evaluation of bilateral protrusion of eyeballs. There was history of easy fatigability and ill-health for past 2 months. His clinical examination revealed anemia and bilateral proptosis. CBC showed Hb 8 g/dl, TLC 18 k, DLC 80% myeloblasts, platelets 70 k. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits revealed lacrimal gland enlargement pushing eyeballs medially and down [Figures 1â€“4]. The patient was shifted to medical oncology department on the same day.

The aim of highlighting this image is how varied can be the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting as proptosis.
