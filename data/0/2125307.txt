THE HEART MUSCLE IN PNEUMONIA

 1. The heart muscle is not functionally impaired in pneumonia, since the pneumonic ventricle beats normally as soon as its food is normal. 2. Pneumonic blood, suddenly fed to normal heart muscle, lowers its efficiency, lessening the duration and the area of contraction. 3. The heart muscle in pneumonia, exposed gradually to the action of the poison, largely adjusts itself to its poisoned food.
