We report a rare case of a primary leiomyosarcoma of the adrenal gland. A 73-year-old woman presented with an inferiorvena cava syndrome. MR imaging was suggestive of a large tumour originating from the right adrenal gland. Angiographyrevealed a tumour vascularised by the right adrenal artery. At explorative laparotomy a tumour of 27 cm in diameter wasfound which was completely fixed to the liver; the tumour was therefore considered unresectable. As a consequence of themechanical problems caused by this large tumour, the patient died 3 weeks after the operation. Autopsy revealed no distantmetastases or other primary tumour site.
