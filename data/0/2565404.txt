Transcortical Alterations in Na+-K+ ATPase and     Microtubule-Associated Proteins Immunoreactivity in the Rat Cortical Atrophy Model Induced by Hypoxic Ischemia

To identify the chronological transcorticalchange in the contralateral hemispherefollowing ischemic insults, we investigated thechanges in microtubule associated protein(MAP) and Na+-K+ ATPase expressions in theperi-infarct zone and contralateral hemisphere,including the hippocampus. Two days afterhypoxic ischemia, Na+-K+ ATPase immunoreactivitywas significantly enhanced in thecontralateral cortex and was maintained up to 7days after ischemia, whereas Na+-K+ ATPase immunoreactivity in the peri- and infarct zoneswas unaffected by hypoxic ischemia. In contrast,2 to 7 days after ischemia, MAP1A and MAP2immunoreactivity in the ipsi- and contralateralcortex significantly decreased, whereas in layerV, MAP1 immunoreactivity obviously accumulatedin the neurons and their processes. In thehippocampus, 2 days after insults both MAP1Aand MAP2 immunoreactivity was significantlyreduced within the ipsi- and contralateralhippocampus. In the contralateral hippocampus,however, the distribution of MAP2 immunoreactivityrecovered to the sham level 7 daysafter ischemia, whereas MAP1A immunoreactiveaxons remained 2 months afterischemia. The results suggest that the unilateralelevation of Na+-K+ ATPase immunoreactivityreflects elevated neuronal activity. In addition,this asymmetric hyperexcitability might play animportant role in the recovery or thereorganization of the brain, accompanied bytranscortical changes in MAPs expression.
