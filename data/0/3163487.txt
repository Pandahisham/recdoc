Neural representations of the sense of self

The brain constructs representations of what is sensed and thought about in the form of          nerve impulses that propagate in circuits and network assemblies (Circuit Impulse          Patterns, CIPs). CIP representations of which humans are consciously aware occur in the          context of a sense of self. Thus, research on mechanisms of consciousness might benefit          from a focus on how a conscious sense of self is represented in brain. Like all senses,          the sense of self must be contained in patterns of nerve impulses. Unlike the traditional          senses that are registered by impulse flow in relatively simple, pauci-synaptic projection          pathways, the sense of self is a system- level phenomenon that may be generated by impulse          patterns in widely distributed complex and interacting circuits. The problem for          researchers then is to identify the CIPs that are unique to conscious experience. Also          likely to be of great relevance to constructing the representation of self are the          coherence shifts in activity timing relations among the circuits. Consider that an          embodied sense of self is generated and contained as unique combinatorial temporal          patterns across multiple neurons in each circuit that contributes to constructing the          sense of self. As with other kinds of CIPs, those representing the sense of self can be          learned from experience, stored in memory, modified by subsequent experiences, and          expressed in the form of decisions, choices, and commands. These CIPs are proposed here to          be the actual physical basis for conscious thought and the sense of self. When active in          wakefulness or dream states, the CIP representations of self act as an agent of the brain,          metaphorically as an avatar. Because the selfhood CIP patterns may only have to represent          the self and not directly represent the inner and outer worlds of embodied brain, the self          representation should have more degrees of freedom than subconscious mind and may          therefore have some capacity for a free-will mind of its own. S everal lines of evidence          for this theory are reviewed. Suggested new research includes identifying distinct          combinatorially coded impulse patterns and their temporal coherence shifts in defined          circuitry, such as neocortical microcolumns. This task might be facilitated by identifying          the micro-topography of field-potential oscillatory coherences among various regions and          between different frequencies associated with specific conscious mentation. Other          approaches can include identifying the changes in discrete conscious operations produced          by focal trans-cranial magnetic stimulation.

Theories for conscious mind range from bizarre to prosaic. Bizarre theories include        spiritualistic ideas in which mind is imposed on brain from the outside, as if the brain        were some sort of antenna (Nunez, 2010). But even        traditional science could yield such theories: a case in point is the theory that quantum        mechanics entanglement might influence mind at a distance (Stapp, 2007). Other possible explanations for consciousness might be imagined        based on string theory, dark matter, or dark energy if the nature of these new discoveries        were understood.
The more popular theories include those based on Bayesian probability (Tolman, 1932; cf. Doya,          Ishii, Pouget, & Rao, 2007), or chaos theory (Izhikevich, 2007; Freeman, 2009).        These ideas when applied as explanations for consciousness tend to be more metaphor than        mechanism. Chaos and Bayesian ideas seem to provide fascinating descriptions, but seem        lacking in explanatory power. To understand mind, we may ultimately be forced to invoke        mathematical models, subatomic physics, or science that doesn’t exist yet. But we        don’t have to invoke some kind of “ghost in the machine” to        understand consciousness.
To understand conscious mind we have to understand the other aspects of brain function:        non-conscious functions such as spinal and brainstem reflexes and neuroendocrine control.        Fortunately, we know a great deal about non-conscious neural machinery that ought to be        applicable for explaining conscious mind. Common sense, as well as a great deal of        neuroscientific evidence, indicates that the conscious mind emerges from the same place that        houses non-conscious and subconscious minds: circuits in the brain.
Theories of consciousness mechanisms have perhaps been hindered by vagueness. A more        tangible way to think about consciousness is to regard it as sixth sense, the sense of self.        Thus, like all senses the sense of self must have a neural representation based on patterns        of nerve impulses. Consider that an embodied sense of self is generated and contained as        unique combinatorial patterns across multiple neurons in the same circuit. As with other        kinds of Circuit Impulse Patterns (CIPs), those representing the sense of self can be        learned from experience, stored in memory, modified by subsequent experiences, and expressed        in the form of decisions, choices, and commands. These CIPs could be the actual physical        basis for conscious thought and the sense of self.
The question of where to look for sense-of-self CIPs should begin with recognizing the        areas of brain that are necessary and sufficient for conscious awareness in the context of        self. These areas are well known and constitute what I call the consciousness          system.
The seminal and well-established work in cats of the 50s by Morruzzi, Magoun, and others        (reviewed in Klemm & Vertes, 1990)        established that consciousness depends on an “ascending reticular arousal        system” (ARAS) in the brainstem that activates the neocortex to generate        consciousness. The ARAS receives direct activating collateral input from all traditional        senses (except olfaction) and in turn activates the neocortex to produce alert wakefulness.        Part of this ascending activating pathway also includes the rostral extension of brainstem        reticular neurons that surround the main body of the thalamus. Electrical stimulation of the        reticular thalamus evokes the characteristic signs of consciousness, namely, field-potential        gamma waves in widespread areas of the neocortex (MacDonald,          Fifkova, Jones, & Barth, 1998). Yet another component is the intra-laminar        portion of the thalamus, neurons of which have characteristic impulse firing patterns during        wakefulness (Steriade & Glenn, 1982). During        transitions to wakefulness, intra-laminar thalamic neurons exhibit marked increases in        firing, which lag the initial increase in brainstem and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.        Thus, it may be that while brainstem neurons trigger consciousness, intra-laminar thalamic        neurons may be needed to sustain it and regulate attention shifts (reviewed by Schiff, 2008). In non-human primates, shifts in attention        correlate with field potential oscillations in intra-laminar thalamus of 20-80 Hz (Fries, Reynolds, Rorie, & Desimone, 2001; Murthy & Fetz, 1996; Pesaran, Pezaris, Sahani, Mitra, & Andersen, 2002). Oscillations        in this high-frequency range in the neocortex are well-known characteristics of        consciousness.
In addition to the well-known projections from neocortex back into the brainstem reticular        area, there are also cortico-fugal projections into the intra-laminar thalamus.        Collectively, these interconnected brain areas constitute what could be called a          consciousness system (Figure 1).
Author’s concept of consciousness as a system function of specific areas of            brain.
 Steriade and McCarley (2005) vowed to        “resurrect” the classic Moruzzi/Magoun studies “from unjustified        oblivion.” The often-forgotten consensus is that the ARAS responds to sensory input        and creates a cascade of ascending excitatory influences that eventually trigger the cortex        into wakefulness and consciousness. The brainstem reticulum integrates converging signals        from the viscera, internal milieu, and the bodily senses. It also contains circuitry that        regulates vital functions of the heart and respiratory system, sleep and wakefulness cycles,        arousal, attention, and the emotions (reviewed by Klemm          & Vertes, 1990). Consciousness arises when the outer mantle of brain, the        neocortex, is activated (or disinhibited) by influences from the brainstem reticular        formation and its rostral extension, the reticular thalamus (Yingling & Skinner, 1977). 
But showing which parts of brain constitute a consciousness system does not explain much.        It merely shows where conscious mind comes from and how it might be triggered and sustained.        This present review will focus on how consciousness, once triggered, might be produced and        sustained.
While the neocortex is only one part of the consciousness system, it is the most crucial        part. Focal lesions, as in cardiovascular stroke, for example, produce specific deficiencies        in conscious operations. The brainstem and thalamic components of the consciousness system        lack the complex network architecture of the neocortex and thus are not likely to do more        than limited conscious processing. But the brainstem reticulum is crucial to consciousness,        for without the cortical drive it produces, there is permanent coma.
Microscopic examination of the neocortex shows that all parts of it have a similar columnar        architecture (Douglas & Martin, 2004; see          Figure 2). Cortical columns, at their most basic        structural level, have their constituent neurons oriented perpendicular to the surface, with        its neurons “hard wired” to form a miniature network assembly, typically        referred to as a minicolumn. Such a small assembly is not likely to have        much direct impact on conscious operations, but when columns act in the aggregate much more        sophisticated operations become possible. Several adjacent minicolumns form functional        aggregates, called macrocolumns. About a thousand minicolumns aggregate        into a macrocolumn. Macrocolumns have a size of a few millimeters.
Simplified diagram of the excitatory neurons in any given cortical column (Area A) of            the human neocortex and the interconnections with other columns (Area B). The vertical            layer location of neurons is indicated by L3, L4, etc. Shown are input sources from            subthalamus (Sub) and thalamus (Thal). The nodes of the graph are organized            approximately spatially; vertical corresponds to the layers of cortex, and horizontal to            its lateral extent. Arrows indicate the direction of excitatory action. Thick edges            indicate the relations between excitatory neurons in a local patch of neocortex. Thin            edges indicate excitatory connections to and from subcortical structures, and            inter-areal connections. Each node is labeled for its cell type. For cortical cells, Lx            refers to the layer in which its cell body is located, P indicates that it is an            excitatory neuron. Thal = thalamus and Sub = other subcortical structures, such as the            basal ganglia. Not shown are the inhibitory neurons and the modulating brainstem inputs,            such as noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, serotonergic neurons in the raphe            nuclei, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and the energizing            cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis. Top of diagram is the outer surface of            cortex, while bottom of diagram shows the deepest layers of cells. Adapted from            “Cortical Architecture,” by T. Binzegger, R. J. Douglas, and A. C.            Martin, in M. De Gregorio, V. Di Mayo, M. Frucci, & C. Mucio (Eds.),              BVAI 2005. LNCS, Berlin: Springer-Verlag, p. 21.
 The explanation of columns just given is the common view, but it is simplistic. A recent        review by daCosta and Martin (2010) points out that no        one has actually seen columns as such. They suggest it is probably more correct and useful        to think of cortical columns as “canonical microcircuits.” The idea is that        columns are microcircuits repeatedly stacked adjacent to each other, and their intimate        cross connections produce the collective emergent functions of cerebral cortex. No one        microcircuit stands alone but rather contains only some of the attributes of the whole        cortical apparatus. Functions of the canonical microcircuit are dynamic, changing frequently        in terms of the subset of neurons that are currently active. 
The general assumption is that column activity oscillates at different frequencies. The        important function is the interplay of columns that is governed by shifting degrees of        oscillatory synchrony (Freeman, 2007). But let us not        lose sight of the fact that the oscillations are caused by CIPs.
Another detail about this circuitry that is not shown in the diagram is that the layer 2        and 3 cells (L2 and L3 cells) get different kinds of input at different levels of their        dendrites and cell body. L2 and L3 cells are large pyramidal cells that receive input at        different points of their dendritic arborization from three different types of nearby        inhibitory cells (reviewed by Jones, 2000). Thus the        same cell, and by extension the circuits with which it is associated, can simultaneously        contribute to different representations. One representation might be for a specific sensory        input, while another might contribute to the representation of the sense of self, thus        enabling the conscious sense that it is “I” who sees, hears, and so on.
This idea of impulse patterns as representations is crucial to the thesis herein. Consider        how traditional sensory stimuli are registered in the brain. We know from monitoring known        anatomical pathways for specific sensations that sensory organs and the brain abstract        elements of the outside world and create a representation with CIPs. As long as the CIPs        remain active in real time, the sensation is intact, and may even be accessible to        consciousness. However, if something disrupts ongoing CIPs to create a different set of        CIPs, as for example would happen with a different stimulus, then the original        representation disappears and may be lost. Of course, the original CIPs may have been        sustained long enough to have been consolidated in memory, in which case retrieval back into        active working memory would presumably reconstruct a similar CIP representation of the        original stimulus.
We can infer that impulse firing in distributed neocortical circuits is a representation of        a perceived stimulus or conscious thought from extension of the classical studies of Hubel        and Wiesel (e.g., 1959, 1962). They established that visual images are deconstructed into        fragments, with each fragment being represented by impulse discharge of specific neurons.        Large numbers of these feature-selective neurons are scattered throughout the visual cortex,        each representing its own particular fragmented representation of the over-all image. Such        observations have raised the enigma of explaining how all these fragmentary CIP        representations are coordinated to reconstruct a conscious percept in the        “mind’s eye.” This is now famously referred to as the          binding problem. Of course, the requirement for binding diverse sensory        and cognitive processes extends to numerous brain functions besides vision.
The rich interconnections of various neocortical areas provide a way for the whole complex,        once triggered from the brainstem, to operate as one conscious processing system. Note that        primary neocortical input comes from the thalamus, terminating in layer 4 (Jones, 1998). Numerous feedback loops are evident. This        anatomical substrate for recurrent activity no doubt is a major source of neocortical        oscillations of various frequencies (reviewed by Buzsáki, 2006, and Steriade,        2006).
Such organization shows that cortical columns can be mutual regulators. Clusters of        adjacent columns can stabilize and become basins of oscillating attraction, and the output        to remote regions of cortex can facilitate synchronization with distant basins of attraction          (Freeman, 2007). Control in such a system is        collective and cooperative.
Elemental cortical circuit design includes recurrent excitatory and inhibitory connections        within and between layers (Burkhalter, 2008). Most of        the excitatory drive is generated by local recurrent connections within the cortical layers,        and the sensory inputs from the outside world are relatively sparse (reviewed by Douglas & Martin, 2004). The usefulness of this        design is that weak sensory inputs are amplified by local positive feedback. The risk of        such organization is runaway excitation and, in epilepsy, the problem emerges when a lesion        removes the normal inhibitory influences that hold the circuitry in check (Jefferys & Whittington, 1996).
Current understanding of neocortical circuitry was discovered in non-human primates. Though        human neocortex shows similar anatomical layering and cells types, it is likely that there        are some differences in inter-neuronal connectivity. Nonetheless, animal data make clear        that neocortex has rich interconnections and capacity for generating multiple oscillatory        frequencies with a range of synchronicity possibilities.
The amount of neocortex in humans is relatively much larger than in other primates. But        size alone is not sufficient to explain the unique human cognitive abilities and level of        consciousness (reviewed by Herculano-Houzel,        2009).
Inhibitory circuits are crucial for controlling oscillations and time-chopping of impulse        traffic, both within and among columns (reviewed by Buzsáki, 2006). Some 10-20% of all synapses in neocortex are thought to be        inhibitory (reviewed in Douglas & Martin,        2004). We know that neocortex generates multiple-frequency oscillations and that        oscillation can time-chop the throughput so that information flows best on every half cycle        (reviewed by Buzsáki, 2006, p. 171). Yet no        one has identified the temporal succession of impulse patterns for a given mental state,        even in a single cortical column. If the impulse activity of multiple neurons in a given        column could be recorded simultaneously, then we might have a way to examine the        possibilities for combinatorial coding in a given column as it changes with mental state.        That may be an insurmountable task, even for a single column, not to mention multiple        columns under the same conditions. At a minimum, we could compare a limited set of        observations from cortical columns such as undefined multiple-unit activity or field        potentials during sleep, anesthesia, alert wakefulness, and dreaming.
The currency of conscious mind is the action potential, or more precisely, the spatial and        temporal patterns of impulses in distributed and linked microcircuits and networks (cf.          Figure 3). As mentioned, some parts of the so-called          consciousness system exhibit characteristic firing patterns during alert        wakefulness. But all studies of impulse activity at various points along the consciousness        system have been performed on neurons without regard to impulse activity in other neurons        that are also in the same microcircuit. I wish to emphasize the need to study neurons        simultaneously in the same identified circuit, especially in neocortical micro-columns. A        given column could perform its functional representations of thought via a combinatorial        code across all neurons in the column. This idea of combinatorial coding is central to the        theme of this review and will be explored below. While many investigators have reported        specific impulse patterns associated with certain conscious functions, what is lacking is        identification of combinatorial patterns across multiple neurons in the same circuit.
Illustration of the idea of CIPs. In this example small circuit, each neuron generates            a certain pattern of spikes, which in turn influences a target neuron. For example, the            inhibitory neuron #2 shuts down activity in #3, which nonetheless may reactivate when            the inhibition wears off or when excitation comes from another circuit with which it            interfaces. Collectively, all the neurons in the circuit constitute a combinatorial CIP            for a finite segment of time. When embedded within a network of interfacing circuits,            such a CIP may become part of a more global set of combinatorial CIPs that can be            regarded as a representation of specific mental states.
 Impulses give rise to a wide range of correlates of consciousness (Koch, 2004). But correlates are not always necessary or sufficient to        explain consciousness. Not all correlates can be expected to help cause consciousness. Even        so, consciousness “presents itself,” as Fingelkurts, Fingelkurts, and Neves          (2010a) put it, and Koch would presumably suggest        that some sort of neurophysiological processes make that happen. Therefore, looking for        correlates seems to have merit as long as the focus is on those correlates that could have a        causal effect on conscious sense of self. 
There are those who argue the need to identify a special process within the brain instead        of looking for neural correlates. Yet such a process is a correlate. Moreover, that process        is generated by neuronal firing. Consciousness is intrinsically experiential and        first-person subjective. First-person experiences have to be represented by neuronal        activity. So, I extend the sensory representation idea mentioned above to suggest a more        global representation of a sense of self, perceived in consciousness.
Fingelkurts, Fingelkurts, and Neves (2010b) say that        consciousness “presents itself,” yet is also an emergent property of brain.        My interpretation of their explanation is that the operational level of brain organization        resides in internal physical brain architecture (i.e., canonical cortical column circuits),        and is the basis for conscious sense of self. Thus the operational level ties        neurophysiological and subjective domains together. The operational level constitutes        consciousness, rather than “emits” it in some mysterious way. Consciousness        is self-presenting at the level of operational architectonics of the brain, but is emerging        in relation to the neurophysiological level of brain organization.
How is the information of neuronal impulses packaged and distributed? A main purpose of        this paper is to encourage neuroscientists to consider the possible usefulness of        combinatorial mathematics for the analysis of CIPs. Until now neuroscientists have not found        much need to use combinatorial mathematics, which is a well-established math discipline that        could be appropriate for testing the role of CIPs in consciousness.
Combinatorial coding, as a principle, clearly operates with certain neural processes, such        as taste and odor perception. Also, an argument for combinatorial coding is well established        for gene expression in which traits depend on many genes (Kobayashi et al., 2000). We should consider the possibility of application to        neural circuit ope-ration. Combinatorial coding could be the “operational        level” of consciousness that Fingelkurts and co-workers (2010a, 2010b) espouse. A simple        example of how a combinatorial CIP code might be manifest is shown in Figure 4.
One simple way to identify any existing combinatoric code of spike trains in a defined            network. Moving a small time window across simultaneously recorded spike trains allows            detection of which neurons produced spikes within that window and the code could be read            as a sequence of 0 s and 1 s. In this illustration of 10 simulated spike trains, each            has the same conventionally calculated interval histogram. Yet each train contains a            “byte” set of serially ordered intervals (expressed here as a            “++++” pattern where each interval has a longer duration than the            succeeding one). This ordering is not otherwise detectable. At any instant of time            (vertical dashed lines) activity within the whole circuit of 10 neurons can be seen to            be indexed as a combinatorial coding of impulses; these can even be expressed in            quasi-digital form, with presence or absence of an impulse being indicated as a 1 or 0,            respectively).
Evidence that combinatorial codes exist in cortical circuitry have been detected by Reich        et al. in 2001 (Reich, Mechler, & Victor,          2001). They found evidence of combinatorial codes from samples of up to six        simultaneously recorded visual cortex neurons. However, they did not confirm that the spike        trains came from within the same microcolumn. Recently, Osborne and colleagues (Osborne, Palmer, Lisberger, & Bialek, 2008)        report that temporal patterns of spikes and silence across a population of cortical neurons        can carry up to twice as much information about visual motion than does population spike        count. This result held even when they imposed levels of correlation comparable to those        found in cortical recordings. Again, the spike trains were not identified as coming from        neurons in the same circuit.
Another neglected area is the sequential ordering of impulses in single spike trains, not        to mention ordering across multiple neurons in the same circuit. While historically impulse        coding research has focused on firing rate, it is also clear that important information is        carried by when impulses occur. Some 30 years ago, there was significant interest in        sequential ordering of impulse intervals, but that interest has since waned. One, as yet        unfalsified, possibility is that serially ordered intervals could indicate that spike trains        are processed as “bytes” (reviewed in Klemm          & Sherry, 1982). Although the idea of spike-interval coding has long since        been abandoned by most neuroscientists, the evidence for it has not been refuted. If neural        circuits do carry some of its information in the form of spike clusters of serially        dependent intervals, then mixing input from two or more spike trains could produce an output        that preserves the distinct packets of information in ways that could be read and        differentiated by other circuits to which it is projected.
This model may be somewhat analogous to the genetic code. While much of DNA is junk        (“noise”), there are many isolated unique pieces (“bytes”)        that do all the work in highly differentiated ways.
Evidence accumulates that timing of impulses, as opposed to numbers per unit of time, are        important to information processing in brain. For example, phase-locking of single units to        oscillations seems to be a pre-requisite for successful memory formation (Rutishauser, Ross, Mamelak, & Schuman, 2010).        Simulation experiments by Masquelier and colleagues (Masquelier, Hugues, Gustavo, & Thorpe, 2009) recently showed that the        phase of impulse firing relative to the oscillation of field potentials provides an        important learning scheme. In the last few years, the neuroscience community has shown        increasing interest in the role of field-potential coherence in cognitive processes.
Neocortical architecture suggests that its CIP representations either enable conscious        awareness or are themselves the essence of consciousness. Of course, CIPs, though essential,        are themselves dependent on biochemical processes such as neurotransmitter systems.
Consider the possibility that conscious mind also has its own CIP representation.        Specifically, when the brain constructs a sense of self, it must do so via neural        representation, which takes the form of unique CIPs. Most neuroscientists might agree that        an idea, for example, has a neural representation in a set of CIPs. Is that the same as        saying that the CIP is the idea? If the idea can be visualized, then it becomes expressed        when the CIPs include those portions of the visual cortex that create the idea in the        “mind’s eye.” If the idea can be described verbally, it becomes        expressed when the CIPs include the language systems in the left hemisphere.
Just as certain CIPs are a representation of bodily sensations, the brain may also use a        unique set of CIPs to generate a consciousness sense of self. When we humans are awake, we        are automatically conscious. Given that much of our awake function is performed        subconsciously, that means that both states are launched concurrently, from sleep for        example. Given that subconscious and conscious functions are so different, each could have        different CIP representations, which would in theory be identifiable and        distinguishable.
A conscious mind could emerge when subconscious mind achieves a certain “critical        mass” of distributed circuit activity that becomes interlinked and coordinated in a        unique way. This created conscious mind then becomes available to enrich the processing of        subconscious operations. Conscious mind is not aware of the processes of subconscious        activity but is aware of the consequences of such activity. No longer is the brain limited        to execution of existing programs, but now the introspection of conscious mind allows a        deeper consideration of what is being experienced.
Most importantly, the subconscious mind now has another source of programming. Conscious        mind provides a new dimension for actively programming the subconscious. In short, conscious        mind is the brain’s way of intervening with itself. This goes to the heart of the        biological case for free will and personal responsibility. The representations of self may        not be devoted to the external and internal worlds of embodied brain, as is required of the        representations of subconscious mind. Therefore, the sense of self may be less constrained        and may have more degrees of freedom for its operations. In short, a degree of free will may        be enabled.
The case for free will is argued elsewhere (Klemm,          2010). Actually, this analysis focused on showing flaws in the research reports        many have used to claim free-will is an illusion. Other than anecdote and personal        experience, convincing evidence for free will remains to be discovered. For the sake of        argument, let us consider the possibility that conscious mind is the “I” of        each person, and can sometimes be in control. If one thinks of this as an avatar, the        conscious mind avatar not only can control the subconscious but it can also control itself.        Conscious mind can choose what to read, what people to associate with, what is good for the        individual, what attitudes to hold and adjust, what to believe, and what to do. True,        because of pre-existing subconscious programming, some conscious choices are more        deterministic than others. But because of conscious mind, everyone can at least become aware        of the price being paid for bad choices and have the option to change course, to change        brain’s programming accordingly.
It is clear that a brain avatar could make such choices. What is less clear is whether        those choices are freely willed. But the neural representation for the sense of self is        probably quite different from the representations held in subconscious mind. Subconscious        representations are constrained by the realities of the physical world, both inside and        outside the body. The conscious avatar has no such constraint, because it’s        representations are not necessarily referenced to worldly events. True, the avatar        representations are often modified and biased by the output of subconscious programming, as        evidence by mental “knee-jerk” responses.
Another area of distinction is the capacity for introspection, which by definition occurs        in the consciousness of the avatar. Introspection processes likely have their own neural        representations which yield choices, decisions, and commands. Introspection expands the        realm of alternatives for what to do. This is equivalent to expanding the degrees of freedom        for the avatar’s actions. The avatar could be less rigidly programmed than        subconscious mind. Therefore, the information processing occurring in the representations of        self should be less deterministic – perhaps to the point of allowing a degree of        free will.
I agree with those who say who we are is largely learned through experience Much of this        learning has occurred and is “remembered” implicitly and subconsciously          (LeDoux, 2002). Consciousness, given the nature of        the brain systems that enable it, is able to participate in this learned sense of self.        Consistent with this view, LeDoux also contends that the self is constructed. This        construction is a life-long learning process, being most evident during childhood. Babies,        for example, initially seem to act as if they are an extension of the mother and        progressively develop indicators of self-awareness. What they learn about themselves is        presumably reflected in their CIPs.
The brain not only contains CIP representations of things we have experienced, but it also        can create CIP representations of things and events that we have never experienced.        Creativity is a marvelous mystery. Creating a representation of things never seen nor        experienced requires reconstituting in unique ways the CIP representations of things we have        seen or experienced. No one knows how the brain decides which circuits to engage to generate        creative thought. No one knows why some brains are better at the creative process than        others. Nor do we know if brains can be taught to be more creative, or if so, how to do        it.
Regardless of what CIPs produce the “I” of consciousness, those processes        should also be capable of modifying their processing according to the nature of their        output, some of which is represented in the consciousness. When we have a conscious        experience, the neural processes that make us aware of the output of those circuits provide        a physical substrate for self-adjustment, which may also be manifest in the consciousness.        In other words, the brain can control its own consciousness.
If thoughts are tagged in the form of CIPs, how does the brain make itself aware of its own        CIPs? Does the brain have some sort of meta-tagging mechanism wherein each CIP is itself        tagged in a way so that multiple CIPs, when merged at the same time, now have an emergent        property that enables an awareness of what the various CIPs represent? If so, how could any        such meta-tagging be accomplished?
The process could operate at both subconscious and conscious levels. The difference for        conscious mind, however, could be that conscious mind does not “see” the        original stimulus, but mainly “looks in on” the CIP representation being        held in subconscious mind (sCIPs). Conscious mind may contain CIP (cCIP) representations of        another sort. Namely, the brain creates a separate conscious mind that is representation of        self-identity, as opposed to representations of external world. Note the emphasis here is        that the self-awareness of consciousness is constructed, rather than emergent. Thus, the        sense of self-identity can grow with time, being modified by biological maturation and        learning experience, resulting in evolving CIP representations.
One may be tempted to conclude that consciousness is a figment of our imagination. Not so.        Our sense of individual identity really does exist, presumably in the form of CIPs. Similar        things could be said for subconscious mind. The CIPs are themselves very real and subject to        biological forces. They are also subject to what many people would call mentalistic forces,        given that those mentalistic forces are actually mediated by CIPs.
This view gives rise to the proposition that conscious mind is a CIP avatar that act as the        brain’s active agent, a “free will” partner in brain function that        operates in parallel and in conjunction with subconscious mind to make the total brain        function more adaptive and powerful than could be achieved with subconscious mind only.        Evolutionarily, such co-evolution may be the mechanism that changed pre-humans from zombies        to who we are today.
The sense of self persists in dreams, and thus we should consider that dreams are a special        form of consciousness. In a separate paper, I will present a theory for why humans dream,        more specifically, why they have the periodic episodes of rapid-eye movement sleep which        promote dreaming. Suffice it to say here that EEG signs during dreaming are similar to those        seen in alert wakefulness, and thus the same CIP and coherence mechanisms that operate in        causing consciousness may also operate during dreaming.
In the last decade, it has become common for theorists to invoke oscillatory        synchronization as the basis for consciousness. The emphasis is usually on electromagnetic        fields, which as a practical matter are usually monitored as the EEG or field potentials        from within the brain. Cortical column assemblies oscillate because the microcircuits in a        mini-column oscillate, and since mini-columns are cross connected, they can couple with each        other with varying degrees of time locking. Such functional coupling provides a basis for        binding the distributed functions and thus generating unified perceptions and thoughts          (Edelman & Tononi, 2000; Singer, 2001).
A flurry of publications in the last few years clearly implicates field potential        oscillation and synchrony among brain areas in consciousness. But most researchers have not        made the most of their data. For example, one index of degree of consciousness could well be        the ratio of gamma activity to activity at other frequencies. Another index could be        frequency-band-specific differences in the level and topographic distribution of coherence        within and between frequencies.
Not everyone accepts the leading theory that high-frequency coherence mediates the binding        of fragmented sensory elements, such as bars and edges in a visual scene, and could        similarly bind cognitive processes (Shadlen &          Movshon, 1999). Evidence that synchrony promotes binding is indirect and incomplete        at best. It may be true, as critics argue, that synchrony is only the signature of sensory        (and presumably cognitive) binding. No compelling explanation is yet available for how        synchrony actually achieves binding. In any case, changes in synchrony must be generated by        underlying combinatorially coded CIPs.
Yet even critics conclude that synchronicity must be important, and it might be uniquely        important to the issue of consciousness. To be dismissive of oscillatory synchronization is        a kind of physiological nihilism and is not warranted by the huge number of phenomena with        which it has been associated (Buzsáki, 2006).        Transient synchronization of field potential oscillations reflects the underlying linkage        and unified function of large neuronal networks. Consciousness likely depends on large-scale        cortical network synchronization in multiple frequency bands (not just the ever-popular 40        Hz). Thus, it may be that it is not binding as such that creates consciousness, but rather        the kind of binding or to the accessibility to the product of binding by conscious mind.
For instance a study of EEG coherence responses to ambiguous figure stimuli (Klemm, Li, & Hernandez, 2000), evaluated the        cognitive binding associated with the “eureka” of sudden realization of the        alternative percept in ambiguous-figure drawings. This cognitive eureka was manifest in        widespread spatial coherence in two or more frequency bands. These might even have had        meaningful synchronization with each other, but that was not tested. Even so, it is not        clear why or how consciousness would arise from multiple-frequency binding unless the        coherence in different frequencies carries different information. One frequency might carry        the information while another might carry the conscious awareness of the information.        Another possibility is that coherence creates consciousness only if enough different areas        of the brain share in the coherence. These are compelling questions for future research.        Ambiguous-figure stimuli are especially useful because the brain can simultaneously hold a        conscious perception and a subconscious representation of the identical physical stimulus of        the retina. Also, a human can consciously control which of the alternative percepts are        consciously perceived at any given moment.
It seems likely that only a fraction of subconscious processing is accessible at any one        time, suggesting that only a sub-set of CIPs could acquire the conditions necessary for        consciousness or that access to certain subconscious networks is blocked by inhibition. The        corollary is that conscious registration may have limited “carrying        capacity,” which is definitely demonstrable in the case of working memory. Maybe        this is because the CIPs of consciousness have to hold in awareness and working memory not        only the CIP information from the subconscious and ongoing external input but also those for        the sense of self and all that it entails.
Oscillation coupling determines which neuronal assemblies communicate at any particular        instant, and thus the brain can re-wire itself dynamically on a time scale of milliseconds        without any need for changing synaptic hardware (Izhikevich,          Desai, Walcott, & Hoppensteadt, 2003). A change in frequency allows various        neuronal assemblies to process information with minimal cross interference and even allows        neurons or mini-columns to participate in different macro-assemblies simply by changing        frequency and coherence coupling.
A recently elaborated theory of consciousness (Fingelkurts          et al., 2010a, 2010b) bears some resemblance        to the avatar idea in the sense that consciousness is thought to arise as a special form of        oscillation and synchronization of field potentials among cortical columns. These voltage        fields appear as quasi-stationary epochs (from about 30 ms to 6 s) epochs and reflect the        underlying mental operations. Synchronization of many such simple operations produced by        transient neuronal assemblies located in different brain areas produce spatial-temporal        patterns (operational modules, OM) responsible for complex mental operations. OMs can be        further synchronized among each other, forming even more complex OMs. Some OMs are        equivalent to thoughts. OMs exist as long as there is synchrony of operations that        constitute it. Therefore some OMs “live” longer than others; and, therefore        some thoughts are longer than others.
The brain produces a range of long and short thoughts which may operate like        “frames” of a motion picture. The frames arise from activity in neurons as        they interact in oscillatory fashion within and across their local networks. These frames,        separated by interludes of less neuronal participation, are concantenated to produce a        stream of thought. Certain kinds of frames give rise to consciousness. Conscious thought        arises when the cortical columns creating the frames become sufficiently cross-linked and        coordinated.
This view seems to have some limitations. First, the frame idea applies most directly to        alpha rhythm which can occur as short epochs of a fixed frequency oscillation where the        amplitude waxes and wanes over successive time epochs. However, long sustained epochs of        alpha occur in relaxed meditative states, not states of more demanding thinking. Also, a few        patently conscious people do not exhibit alpha. There is also the problem that        high-frequency oscillations in the gamma range and beyond would seem less likely to exist in        segmented frame form and more likely to fuse as a continuum.
The main problem is the underlying question of where the oscillating fields come from. One        is led to think the conscious realizations come from the field potentials themselves.        Ignored is the underlying role of the CIPs that generate the oscillations in the first        place. Oscillatory fields certainly reflect what is happening during thinking, but may not        be the cause. They certainly are not equivalent to the underlying discrete CIPs whose flow        through circuitry may be modulated by the field-potential environment in which they        propagate. However, this point is implicit in the statement in the Fingelkurts’        paper (Fingelkurt et al., 2010a, 2010b) to the effect that thought operations are        “indexed” by the EEG. But the key question is: Are field potentials the        message or a reflection of the message? Is it the fields that are interacting or the message        exchange of combinatorial impulse codes?
There are lines of evidence that support the CIP theory in addition to the rationale just        developed. Evidence falls into two categories of predictions:
1. The CIPs, or some manifestation thereof, such as the EEG or field potentials, should        change as the state of consciousness changes.
2. Changing the CIPs or their manifestation should change the state of consciousness.
In the first category, the whole history of EEG studies, both in laboratories and in        hospital settings, attests to the fact that there is generally a strong correlation between        the EEG and the state of consciousness. There are apparent exceptions, but these        EEG-behavioral dissociations, as they are called, can be attributed to methodology or to        misinterpretations of the state of consciousness (Klemm,          1992).
For example, an apparent arousal EEG does not always suggests consciousness. Reports of EEG        in lower animal species, like fish and amphibians, show what seems to be an        “activated” EEG even during behavioral quiescence that superficially looks        like sleep (Klemm, 1973). What is not clear is the        frequency band of such EEGs. Such data were obtained before the age of digital EEG and        frequency analysis. We know little about the full frequency band and the coherences of        various frequency bands in the EEG of any non-primate species. It is entirely possible that        lower animals only have beta activity (less than about 30 per second). Moreover, the degree        and topography of coherences have never been subjected to examination in any lower        species.
The general well-known observations can be summarized as follows:
1. In the highest state of consciousness and alert wakefulness, the EEG is dominated by low        voltage-fast activity, typically including oscillations in the frequency band of 40 and more        waves per second.
2. In relaxed, meditative states of consciousness, the EEG is dominated by slower activity,        often including so-called alpha waves of 8-12 per second.
3. In emotionally agitated states, the EEG often contains a great deal of so-called theta        activity of 4-7 waves per second activity.
4. In drowsy and sleep states, the EEG is dominated by large, irregular slow waves of 1-4        per second.
5. In coma, the trend for slowing of activity continues, but the signal magnitude may be        greatly suppressed.
6. In death, there is no EEG signal.
Because the EEG is a manifestation of overall CIP activity and an        “envelope” of it, such changes in EEG correlates of consciousness support        the notion that it is changes in CIP that create changes in the state of consciousness. Even        so, these are just correlations, and correlation is not the same as causation.
More convincing evidence comes when changing the CIPs, either through disease or through        some external manipulation, changes the state of consciousness. For instance, massive        cerebral strokes may wipe out conscious responsiveness to stimuli from large segments of the        body. Injection of a sufficient dose of anesthetic produces immediate change in neural        activity and unconsciousness ultimately follows. Naturally occurring epilepsy causes        massive, rapid bursts of neural activity that wipe out consciousness. Even during the        “auras” that often precede an epileptic attack, there are localized signs of        epileptic discharge and the patient is very often consciously aware that a full-blown attack        may soon ensue (Schulz et al., 1995).
Another line of evidence comes from the modern experimental technique of transcranial        magnetic stimulation. Imposing large magnetic fields across discrete areas of scalp is        apparently harmless and produces reversible changes in brain electrical activity that in        turn are associated with changes in conscious awareness. A wide range of changes in        consciousness functions can be produced depending on the extent of tissue exposed to the        magnetic field stimulus (Grafman & Wassermann,          1998; see also Capotosto, Babiloni, Romani,          & Corbetta, 2009).
During consciousness, the circuitry of the Avatar learns, memorizes, retrieves, and        interprets its representation of self. That construct appears every time the necessary CIP        conditions are met, as when we wake up each morning in response to a brainstem reticular        formation disinhibition of the cortical circuitry that has kept us asleep.
How can the Avatar get generated each day? There must be a threshold for the non-linear        processes that create the conditions for emergence of the Avatar from its memory store.        Though some people wake up in the morning more groggy that others, consciousness at least in        some people suddenly “comes on,” like a light switch. Although after        anesthesia there may be unconscious thrashing about (that’s why they strap you down        on the gurney), emergence from anesthesia seems instantaneous. Though we cannot yet specify        these processes in detail, we know that once consciousness threshold is reached, the effect        must involve CIPs in the consciousness system.
Could we be consciously aware of our other senses of smell, taste, sight, hearing, etc.        without having a sense of self? In the real time during which subconscious mind registers        sensations, the consciousness Avatar must also be perceiving the sensations. How can this        be? Is there some shared access to sensation? How is the sharing accomplished? Consider the        following example in which the eyes detect a tree (Figure          5).
The image is mapped in subconscious mind by a CIP representation. The brain searches            its circuits for a template match in memory. When a match occurs, the brain searches            further in memory stores for other associations, such as the word tree            and any emotional associations. The memory CIPs are then accessed by the CIPs of the            consciousness Avatar which becomes aware of what the subconscious mind has processed            (and does so in its context of self: “I see the tree”).
Conscious mind monitors and adjusts as necessary its representation of itself. It also        monitors some of the CIP representations of subconscious mind, but presumably has no direct        access to the operations of unconscious mind. The representations of self in conscious mind        can do other free-will kinds of things, such as reflect on what it knows, plans, decides,        and vetoes. In other words, conscious mind is a “mind of its own.”
The idea that non-conscious, subconscious, and conscious minds are represented by CIPs        seems reasonable. Consciousness research might be better spent trying to falsify CIP        hypotheses about mind than with more fanciful ideas such as Bayesian probability, chaos        theory, quantum mechanics, dark energy, or others.
Any scientific theory should have the potential for being tested or shown to be false. But        how can one possibly test this theory − or any other theory of consciousness? Yet        this should not be an excuse to do nothing.
The CIP theory does have the virtue of being based on what we already know to be the        currency of information processing in the brain, at least for the non-conscious and        subconscious brain. We may not need to invoke metaphors and mathematical models. We do not        have to invoke either ghosts or science of the future (such as dark matter or dark        energy).
What is it we need experiments to prove? Certainly not the idea that consciousness acts        like an Avatar. That is just a metaphor, which has little explanatory power. Metaphors        create the illusion of understanding the real thing. Here, the term Avatar is used in an        operational way; that is, consciousness is an agent of embodied brain. It is real, not        metaphor. We don’t live in some kind of cyberspace like the movie Matrix. We are our        consciousness.
Two main experimental approaches seem feasible. One can either disrupt CIPs by external        means and monitor resultant changes in conscious thought or attempt to compare CIPs when        consciousness is present versus when it is not.
We already know that consciousness can be abolished or dramatically disrupted by          disruption of CIPs, as with anesthesia, heavy drug sedation, or electroconvulsive shock. A          more nuanced approach can be achieved with trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TCMS; Walsh & Pascual-Leone, 2003). Such stimulation          indiscriminately affects both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but it most certainly          disrupts whatever CIPs are present at the time of stimulation. The technique is usually          applied focally on specific parts of the neocortex. By selectively altering the CIPs of          parts of neocortex that have specific conscious functions, such as language comprehension,          musical analysis, or certain conscious spatial tasks, one could demonstrate an association          between disruption of CIPs in a given area with disruption of the conscious operations          usually performed by that area. Anodal stimulation increases spike firing rates, while          cathodal stimulation decreases it.
Some evidence exists that TCMS changes power and phase of EEG oscillation. One study          shows that TCMS changed the ratio of alpha to gamma activity over the human parietal          cortex, while at the same time increasing the accuracy of a cognitive task (Johnson, Hamidi, & Postle, 2009).
An effect on conscious choice behavior has recently been reported. Anodal stimulation of          the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the left hemisphere and simultaneous cathodal          stimulation of the corresponding area in the right hemisphere changed the freely chosen          strategy for guessing whether a random draw from a deck of cards would be red or black,          but the opposite stimulus condition did not (Hecht, Walsh,            & Lavidor, 2010).
Cognitive responses to TCMS would confirm only a role for CIPs and not the proposed          Avatar. But it might be possible by manipulating TCMS pulsing parameters and topography to          dissect implicit from explicit operations and show that implicit processing remains while          the explicit Avatar function disappears. Use of ambiguous-figure perception could be quite          useful here.
It is also important to conduct TCMS studies during sleep and other forms of          unconsciousness. Would TCMS of ARAS areas in an awake subject induce sleep? Would TCMS          delivered to focal areas of cortex during sleep influence dream content that is specific          to that cortical area (such as TCMS of visual cortex inducing visual hallucinations)?
TCMS, however, has its limits. One should expect, for example, that applying focal TCMS          over the part of cortex that recognizes specific objects would alter the subject’s          cognitive responses. But such studies might yield interesting findings about whether the          subject knows errors are being made if corrective feedback is not supplied.
We can never describe the CIPs of consciousness until we can record what they are. That          would require simultaneous recording of impulse patterns from many neurons in identified          circuits. Such a process is expedited by knowing in advance which brain areas are          necessary for generating a given conscious operation. The topography of specific conscious          operations could be identified with field-potential coherences and/or TCMS.
To monitor CIPs successfully, we may need better methods of impulse pattern detection and          description. Combinatorial mathematics will likely be a necessary tool in such          investigations. We will also need better methods for examining shifting patterns of          synchrony of multiple units or field potentials among multiple impulse generators.
To detect CIPs most meaningfully, investigators may need to identify combinatorial          patterns of nerve impulses at successive time increments, but also look for embedded          serially ordered impulse interval “bytes” across each neuron in the          circuit. For example, if a “+++−“ pattern occurs non-randomly in          one neuron during a given cognitive state, there may be temporal linkage to that or some          other ordered pattern elsewhere in the circuit.
To monitor impulse activity in distributed circuits could require hundreds, even          thousands of microelectrodes implanted directly into the brain. A more limited approach          would be akin to that mentioned above, wherein one characterizes CIPs in a limited section          (microcolumn) of cortex that is associated with specific conscious functions. It may          suffice just to monitor a few of the neurons in a given identified circuit. Good candidate          conscious functions might include touch perception, language comprehension, musical          analysis, or certain conscious spatial tasks. Perhaps an optical method can be developed          where impulse-sensitive dyes can display, in three dimensions, the impulse activity coming          from individual neurons. Also, to the extent that coherence may be a key mechanism, we          need more robust statistical methods that get beyond pair-wise correlation coefficients to          detect coherence of activity from multiple locations.
Animal studies provide the best chance to place multiple-electrode arrays into multiple          cortical columns and thereby observe associations of certain CIPs with certain cognitive          processes, ranging from simple choice behavior to learning-to-learn situations. TCMS          application to these areas could help determine if the CIPs are mere correlates or          causally involved. Nanotechnology may lead the way in providing the needed electrode          arrays. At a minimum, such electrodes would have to be placed in one cortical column, one          or more adjacent columns, and one or more remote columns that is known to have hard-wired          connection. There is the problem of course of what we assume about animal consciousness, a          problem that diminishes the higher up the phylogenetic scale one goes. Studies in humans,          such as patients with severe epilepsy that require electrode placement, might be feasible.          Studies of this kind could also shed some light on the role of combinatorial coding for          conscious processes.
It is entirely possible that if combinatorially coded CIP changes cause consciousness,          they would be expressed as changed field-potential patterns in topographical and          co-frequency coherence. Several important comparisons should be made. We can, for example,          compare normal adults with babies at various stages of their brain’s maturation.          Another way to test is to compare activity in comatose patients (locked-in state, and          persistent vegetative state) with normal subjects.
An alternative to recording from multiple units is to let averaged evoked response          potentials (ERP) in multiple cortical locations serve as the index of differential CIPs.          The usefulness of ERP for monitoring conscious operations has been documented in such          studies as early language learning in babies. ERP signatures of phonetic learning are          evident at 11 months, responses to known words at 14 months, and syntactic and semantic          learning at 2.5 years (Kuhl & Rivera-Gaxiola,            2008). ERP approaches could allow us to monitor impulse activity at a population          level and identify evoked responses in different cortical areas under conditions when          conscious awareness is manipulated, as with sleep or drugs. Changing conscious state would          surely produce topographical changes in evoked response, which in turn can only be caused          by changes in CIPs. This would not prove the existence of the Avatar, but it could          certainly prove a role for CIPs in consciousness.
Finally, quantitative EEG signals from numerous locations might indirectly indicate          meaningful evidence of the elusive Avatar. Special attention should be paid to the          topography of coherence patterns and coherences among frequencies. Comparison of such          parameters in different states, such as sleep and wakefulness, or under different TCMS          conditions, would be essential. Also helpful would be comparison of EEG coherences in          babies as their own sense of self develops. Studies could be tied to the age at which          self-recognition in a mirror emerges.
The CIPs and frequency coherences must surely differ between subconscious thinking and        conscious thinking. This poses significant problems, since both processes presumably operate        in parallel at roughly the same time. With these basic assumptions, a few questions arise        that could influence design of experiments:
1. How can we identify specific conscious functions and their associated neural        activity?
For example, we can design experiments that will record from or manipulate specific        cortical areas known to mediate specific conscious functions, such as speech centers,        somatosensory cortex, premotor neocortex, and mirror-neuron zones.
More studies are needed with ambiguous figures. The beauty of evaluating perception of        ambiguous figures is that one can compare the same image when it is consciously perceived        and when it is not. Evaluating combinatorially coded CIPs from defined circuits in humans        may not be feasible (electrodes implanted to detect epileptic foci are not normally placed        in the areas of neocortex that would be most useful for study of visual percepts). CIPs        might be amenable to study in monkeys, assuming some clever artist can design ambiguous        figures that have biological meaning to monkeys (such as a drawing that could be interpreted        either as an apple or as a pear). Certainly coherence studies such as the one my lab        performed can be extended in humans, and focal TCMS can be used to see how the percept can        be changed.
2. How can we distinguish subconscious and conscious thinking under otherwise comparable        conditions?
Perhaps this might be accomplished by comparing a classically conditioned response        (subconscious) with the same motor activity generated through conscious and voluntary        decision.
3. Is the distinction between subconscious and conscious processes attributable to CIPs or        to frequency coherences or both?
Obviously, the experiment ideally would examine both combinatorial coding of CIPs and        frequency coherences of field potentials recorded at the same time and under the same        conditions.
4. Are the distinguishing characteristics of subconscious and conscious thinking restricted        to the specific cortical area under investigation or do other more distant brain areas        differentially participate, depending on whether the thought is subconscious or        conscious?
Obviously, the design should also include monitoring of other cortical areas that directly        connect to the specific conscious processing areas.
5. What kinds of discrete conscious thoughts might be useful?
Possible tasks could include word priming (speech centers), willful intent to make certain        movements (premotor cortex), or situations where an observer witnesses an action by another        that takes place within and without the observer’s personal space (mirror neuron        sites). The latter approach can be tested in monkeys, where distinct mirror neurons can be        identified, or in humans where fMRI methods can identify areas which appear to function as a        “mirror neuron system” (Iacoboni et al.,          1999).
6. Can we know if the CIPs and frequency coherences of subconscious thinking occupy the        same circuitry as do those of conscious thinking? Is the neural activity synchronous during        both kinds of thinking or is there a phase lag?
It would seem necessary to simultaneously monitor neural activity in several places, such        as adjacent cortical columns and columns in the other hemisphere that are directly        connected.
7. How can we distinguish between the “noise” of background neural activity        of consciousness as a global state of special awareness and the activity associated with        specific conscious thought?
Experiments must include a conscious null-state in which daydreaming is minimized, and        perhaps avoided altogether by including some kind of conscious focus on a single task        concurrent with the conscious thought task under investigation. For example, one might        require a subject to operate a joy stick that tracks a slowly moving target on a computer        screen while at the same time performing the conscious task under investigation.
8. What possible neural mechanisms could provide the “Avatar” circuitry        with a “free-will agency” capability that is not found in subconscious        mind?
Experiments should compare a subject’s performance of the conscious task at freely        selected intervals, rather than on cue. Alternatively, the subject could function in a cued        mode, but freely choose whether to generate or withhold response to the cue. The experiments        can be based on electrical recordings of previously discovered CIP or frequency coherence        signatures of a specific conscious thought or when subjects attempt the task when the        cortical areas are temporarily disabled, was with local anesthetic or focal TCMS.
Brains construct representations of what they detect and think about. The representations        take the form of patterned nerve impulses propagating through circuits and networks (circuit        impulse patterns, CIPs). This representational scheme has been unequivocally demonstrated        for both non-conscious and subconscious minds.
Conscious mind must also be a CIP representation, but unique in that the constructed        representations are of a sixth sense of self, an awareness of embodied self and what the        self encounters and engages. Thus, this mind may automatically know what it is knowing. This        representation is actually an agent, more or less equivalent to an Avatar, serving the        brain’s interests and imperatives. The conscious Avatar knows information the same        way the non-conscious mind does; that is, through CIP representations of that information.        So, the key question is “What is different about the CIPs of consciousness and those        of non-consciousness or sub-consciousness?” The CIPs of the Avatar likely differ in        spatial and temporal distribution.
The Avatar is a CIP representation itself but also an interpreter of the representations in        the brain. It interprets not just linguistically, but also in such terms as non-verbalized        sensations, reinforcement contingencies, emotions, and probable outcomes of action        alternatives. The Avatar probably has more degrees of operational freedom and could act as a        “free will” partner that operates in parallel and in conjunction with        subconscious mind to make the total brain function more adaptive and powerful than could be        achieved with subconscious mind only (Klemm,        2010).
CIPs, as the currency of thought, seem essential for consciousness. Still, the CIP        hypothesis may not be sufficient to understand conscious mind. But research on the CIPs and        associated field potentials associated with consciousness seems at least as justifiable as        research on the other theories of Bayesian probability, chaos theory, and quantum mechanics.        Conscious mind may operate in many ways like everything else the brain does. We        don’t necessarily have to invoke mathematical models or particle physics or dark        matter/dark energy. Conscious mind constructs CIP representations just as do subconscious        and non-conscious minds, with the difference that what is represented in conscious mind is        not the outside world or the world of the body, but rather the world of ego. Conscious mind        is a CIP representation of the sense of self. This identity is learned, beginning with the        fetus and newborn, and develops as the brain develops capacity to represent itself        consciously. In short, you have learned to be you. I have learned to be me. Our Avatar        nature enables us to change who we are.
The brain creates a CIP representation of its embodied self using visual, tactile, and        proprioceptive sensations. Added to this is a representation of personal space that includes        a representation of the self in three dimensional space. Long-term memory stores this        representation and it is released for operation and updating whenever consciousness is        triggered.
The Avatar CIPs are accessible to the subconscious mind operations that generate the        Avatar. The brain knows that it has this Avatar and knows what it is doing. Stimuli and        assorted thoughts are not isolated. The Avatar knows consciously because its information is        processed within the Avatar’s CIP representation of the sense of self. This        representation is the awareness and the attendant thought.
Proposed here is the idea that conscious perception arises from combinatorial coding of        CIPs. We don’t really know what combinatorial coding means, other than to make the        less-than-helpful conclusion that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. At least,        however, we have good reason to believe that what is being coded is the spatio-temporal        distribution of spikes and the field potentials they generate in multiple linked        neurons.
The needed research tools are at hand for identifying the neural causes of the conscious        sense of self. Let the race begin.
