Hepatitis B virus infection in Northern Ireland 1970-1987.

In the 18 years between 1970 and 1987, 504 patients were found to have hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in their blood. Acute hepatitis was present in 184 patients and six died (3.3%). The annual incidence of acute hepatitis B virus infection in Northern Ireland was about one-quarter that of England and Wales. A decrease in acute infection occurred in 1986-87, while in England and Wales acute infection has fallen by more than half since the peak in 1984. Hepatitis B virus infection in health care staff and patients in high risk groups were reviewed: 32% were in those of foreign origin or who had known foreign contacts. In blood donors there was a marked fall in incidence of hepatitis B surface antigen carriage from 1982 onwards: the incidence in antenatal patients and those screened for rubella antibody (mainly females) was half that of new blood donors in 1972-81. Carrier rates in blood donors and antenatal patients were less than those from other parts of the United Kingdom. All indices show that Northern Ireland has a lower incidence of hepatitis B virus infection than the rest of the United Kingdom.
