Marine Gastrotricha of the Near East: 1. Fourteen new species of Macrodasyida and a redescription of Dactylopodola agadasys Hochberg, 2003

Academic editor: Antonio Todaro
The near eastern geographical region is almost devoid of reports of macrodasyidan gastrotrichs, the exceptions themselves being part of this study. Here, as Part 1 are described fourteen new Macrodasyida from countries of the Near East (Cyprus, Egypt and Israel, representing both the Mediterranean and the Red Seas), and a redescription of the previously described Dactylopodolidae: Dactylopodola agadasys Hochberg, 2002. The new species are: Cephalodasyidae (2) - Cephalodasys dolichosomus; Cephalodasys saegailus; Dactylopodolidae (1) Dendrodasys rubomarinus; Macrodasyidae (5) - Macrodasys imbricatus; Macrodasys macrurus; Macrodasys nigrocellus; Macrodasys scleracrus; Urodasys toxostylus; Thaumastodermatidae(4) - Tetranchyroderma corallium;  Tetranchyroderma rhopalotum; Tetranchyroderma sinaiensis; Tetranchyroderma xenodactylum; Turbanellidae(2) - Paraturbanella levantia; Turbanella erythrothalassia - spp. n.

As of December 2010 there are 305 described species of Macrodasyida, of which 142 species belong in the family Thaumastodermatidae, 56 in the family Turbanellidae and 45 in the family Macrodasyidae, the three most diverse families, and 72 species in the genus Tetranchyroderma, 32 in the genus Macrodasys and 28 in the genus Turbanella, the three most diverse genera in the order. Most of the species contained in this report also belong to the above taxa; they come from two oceanic regions, the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the northern Red Sea. These were part of the fauna that were encountered in Egypt and Cyprus during an eight month Fulbright Research Fellowship from April through November 1994 with the Department of Oceanography in the University of Alexandria. Three trips were also made to Israel, one in February 1992, a second in February 1999, and a third in September 1999, the last covering a full month’s time based at the Department of Zoology at Hebrew University, Jerusalem. This is the first of several such manuscripts, this one on the Macrodasyida, the second forthcoming will be on the known species of Gastrotricha in the region, and a third on new members of the order Chaetonotida.
Basically, work in this geographical region began with Masry (1970) and Hulings (1971), surveying on physical-chemical parameters and meiofauna of the Mediterranean Sea, namely Lebanon and Israel in the Near East. Both found Gastrotricha, but recorded none to species; they were concentrating on micro-crustaceans, and, of course, hardly any of the gastrotrich species that they might have seen had been described at that time. Progress reports on the gastrotrichs of the present study appeared as abstracts under Hummon and co-authors in the American Zoologist in 1992 (Hummon and Hummon 1992), ‘94 (Hummon et al. 1996) and ‘95 (Hummon and Hummon 1995). There exist several written reports of individual chaetonotidan species from this region [Chaetonotus luporinii in Balsamo et al. (1996); Heteroxenotrichula pygmaea in Hummon (2010a) and Aspidiophorus paramediterranea in Hummon (2010b)], whereas the reports of macrodasyidan species have come mostly as spinoff publications of this study, namely Mesodasys adenotubulatus in Hummon et al. (1993); Turbanella bocqueti in Hummon (2008); Tetranchyroderma papii in Hummon (2009); Diplodasys sanctimariae in Hummon and Todaro (2009); and Dactylopodola typhle in Hummon (2010a). Data from this study have been available for co-workers on CD (2001), more recently revised with the addition of additional described species and video sequences of described species, all being transferred to the server of Hummon (2004, 2007, 2009), with many of the collected data from the Mediterranean being referred to in a general way by Todaro at al. (2003) and with many videos being enumerated by Hummon et al. (2005). Of the new species being described here, two are Mediterranean, 12 Red Sea and but one species occurring in both.
Littoral collections were made by whole-beach transects, with 8–10 sites spaced more or less equally from lowest to highest water levels. Locations are presented in a table (Table 1) and a map (Figure 1); more detailed maps will accompany upcoming parts of the study. Sites were sampled at depth using a core tube (for wet samples) or shovel and plastic scoop (for dry samples). Sampling in the sand was mostly continuous, ranging from 0–10 cm (low water levels) to 0–30 (high water levels), usually reaching ground water levels. Sublittoral collections were made by scoop sampler, taken while wading, snorkeling or occasionally diving by SCUBA. Sand was placed in whirl-pak bags, kept at relatively cool temperatures and returned to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. In the lab, samples were keep with little loss of living material for up to 10 days, analysis being carried out as quickly as possible, beginning with earliest collected samples or samples with heavy organic loads.

Analytic methods are more fully given in Hummon (2008). About 20 ml of sand was placed in a 125 ml plastic cup, 6 to 7 % MgCl2 added to cover, and after swirling the cup was left for 10 minutes. An equal amount of ambient sea-water was added, the contents swirled once again, and the supernatant poured into a 60 ml plastic Petri dish, followed by a similar amount of sea-water and another decantation to fill the Petri dish, its contents then being split between that and another Petri dish. After settling, the dish was inspected for now-revived gastrotrichs using a Wild M8 stereo-microscope at 18 to 20 × magnification. A desired specimen was transferred to a drop of MgCl2 on a microscope slide, oriented, covered with a 16 µm square coverslip with posts of non-toxic modeling clay at its corners. After marking the specimen’s location with a fine felt tip marker, the slide was transferred to a Nikon LabPhot II compound microscope with a differential interference contrast (DIC) optics, having numerical apertures (n.a.) for oil immersion objective lenses of 1.00 (for a 100× lens) and 1.25 (for a 63× lens). Videotaping with a Hi8 camcorder began at the highest magnification that would show the entire specimen (4 × objective for very long animals to 40 × for short animals), then again at higher magnifications. Videos have been digitized in wmv format, edited, and rendered into MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) versions, and placed on a server for read-only downloading by other workers (Hummon et al. 2005; Hummon 2009).
Drawings of holotype specimens were made using a drawing tube on the compound microscope. My finished drawings involve both dorsal and ventral views as mirror images of one another, occasionally with a composite dorsal/ventral view of juveniles and/or subadults, and always with drawings of cuticular armature, when appropriate, all with appropriate scale bars. Several of the species described herein are based on subadults, which already show characters of the adults that distinguish them from other species. In addition to the species name, for each is included a unique ‘DOS name’ based on a three-letter designation for genus and a four-letter designation for the specific epithet, giving the eight-letter ‘title’ that originated when the MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) would only allow eight letters for a file-name.
Morphological symbols and conventions are as follows: Lt: Length, total: from anterior tip of head to posterior tip of caudum and its adhesive tubes; LPh: Length, pharynx from anterior tip of head to PhJIn; PhJIn: Junction between pharynx and intestine; WHd /WNk /WTr /WFrBs /WFrTp: Width of head, neck, trunk, furcal base and furcal tips; TbA /TbL /TbD /TbV /TbP /TbS: adhesive tubes of the anterior, lateral, dorsal, ventral, posterior (caudal), and “Seitenfüsschen” series; U: Percentage units of Lt from anterior to posterior × 100; the ‘Adult’ condition is attained when evidence of reproductive maturity is attained: testes, ovules or accessory sex organs. Columns: longitudinal in orientation; Rows: transverse in orientation; the caret ^ refers to a type locality. Latitude and longitude are given for type localities (Ordinance Survey references are given for Israeli locations); those for all other localities can be found in the Global Data Base (Hummon 2009). Sea surface temperatures in the eastern Mediterranean range from 16°C in March to 26°C in August-September; those for the northern Red Sea are about 3°C higher throughout the year. Sea surface salinities in ppt (practical salinity units) for the two regions are not as variable from season to season and range in the upper 30’s in the eastern Mediterranean and in the lower 40’s in the northern Red Sea.

Ciliation:A number of cilia insert on each side of the head (L 9–18 µm); a broad transverse band of cephalic cilia (L 18–20 µm) covers the broadest part of the head from U02 to U05 and joins the locomotor ciliature ventrally; some 30–32 sensory hairs occur in lateral (L 9–12 µm) and dorsolateral (L 18–20 µm) columns along either side of the trunk at U06–U96. Ventral locomotor ciliature forms two longitudinal bands of short (L 9–12 µm), scattered cilia that follow the lateral body contours beneath the entire length of the body, separate medially beneath the head and pharynx, but converging behind the anus and merging into a single band onto the caudum.
Digestive tract: Mouth is terminal, of medium width (6 µm diameter); buccal cavity nearly cylindrical, lined with cuticule of medium thickness; pharynx narrows toward the rear, but with basal pharyngeal pores showing dorsolateraly; intestine broadest in the rear mid-gut region, narrowing behind; anus is ventral at U95.

Cephalodasys dolichosomus sp. n. dorsal and ventral views of a mature adult (Lt=772, LPh=215 µm) from Main Beach, Ras Mohamed National Park, S. Sinai, Egypt; dorsal with dorsal and lateral body cilia, digestive and reproductive tracts; ventral with adhesive tubes and locomotor ciliary bands.
 Red Sea: EGYPT: {23km south of Ein Sukhna, Marsa Bareika N [sdom], ^Main Beach Ras Mohamed NP [cdom] (27°44'N, 34°12'E) [4-videos], Na’ama Bay N [sdom], Sharm el-Sheikh [3-videos], Ras Sudr [sdom]}; ISRAEL: {Coral Beach M5 [2-videos]}.
 There are nine video sequences of Cephalodasys dolichosomus sp. n., all from the upper Red Sea in Egypt and Israel. Three of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #744 a mature adult Lectotype of Lt=772 µm (LPh=178 µm), collected in July 1994 from Main Beach, Ras Mohamed NP, S. Sinai, Egypt; #1917 a mature adult of Lt=763 µm (LPh=172 µm) from Coral Reserve, Eilat, Israel; and the other, #742 a subadult of Lt=186 µm (LPh=93 µm) from Sharm el-Sheikh, S. Sinai, Egypt. Cephalodasys dolichosomus can occupy a variety of sediments, but its greatest numbers occur sublittorally in finer, well sorted sands; it is unusual among the genus in having so many of its findings as co- or sub-dominant abundances.
 Dolichosoma (Greek: dolichos + soma = meaning ‘long body’) refers to the overall length of the animal, enhanced by the relative slenderness of its silhouette.
When mature, Cephalodasys dolichosomus sp. n. is the longest, thinnest member of the genus, the only species in the genus that has the following combination of characters: a small pyriform head, with a transverse band of cephalic cilia, a PhJIn at U28, which also has TbA 4 per side; TbVL 6 per side (5 at U27–U51 and a 6th at U72); and TbP 16 total, borne on a flaired caudum; TbL per se /D/V absent; and ova developing fore to aft, though accessory sex organs were not seen. Cephalodasys dolichosomus belongs in the group of species that have pyriform heads, but is longer, thinner and with fewer TbL than other species with which it might be compared, namely Cephalodasys cambriensis (Boaden, 1963); Cephalodasys littoralis Renaud-Debyser, 1964; Cephalodasys pacificus Schmidt, 1974; and Cephalodasys turbanelloides (Boaden, 1960).

Cephalodasys saegailus sp. n. dorsal and ventral views of a mature adult (Lt=517, LPh=196 µm) from Sidi Abd al-Rahman, Egypt; dorsal with dorsal and lateral body cilia, digestive and reproductive tracts included, ventral with adhesive tubes and locomotor ciliary bands.
 MED: EGYPT {Marsa Matruh [3-vid], ^Sidi Abd al-Rahman [vid]}.
 There are four video sequences of Cephalodasys saegialus sp. n., all from the eastern Mediterranean Sea in Egypt. These are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #755 a mature adult Lectotype of Lt=517 µm (LPh=196 µm), collected in June 1994 from Sidi Abd al-Rahman, Egypt; #754 a mature adult of Lt=492 µm (LPh=191 µm) from Marsa Matruh, Egypt; #753 a subadult of Lt=369 µm (LPh=158 µm) also from Marsa Matruh; and the other #752 a subadult of Lt=193 µm (LPh=95 µm) again from Marsa Matruh. Cephalodasys saegialus feeds on a diversity of diatoms. The largest specimen seen was a young adult and can be expected to reach a longer length, perhaps 600 µm.
 Saegailus (Greek: sos + aigialos = meaning ‘safe shore’) refers to its shallow sublittoral habitat along the southern Mediterranean being sheltered from the west wind (zephyr).
Cephalodasys saegialus sp. n. is the only species in the genus that has the following combination of characters: a pyriform head, with a transverse band of cephalic cilia, and PhJIn at U39–U38, with TbA 4 per side; TbVL 10 per side at U24–U66, with three along the rear pharynx, the others along the fore- and midgut; TbV 2 per side, amidst the TbVL at U44 & U49; TbL per se /D absent; and TbP 18, of varying sizes, insert in more than one row around the rear of the caudum, with testes but neither ova nor accessory sex organs seen. Cephalodasys saegialus belongs in the group of species that have pyriform heads, but is unique in having an extended gap between TbL and TbP and in having TbV, compared with other species with which it might be compared, namely Cephalodasys cambriensis (Boaden, 1963); Cephalodasys littoralis Renaud-Debyser, 1964; Cephalodasys pacificus Schmidt, 1974; and Cephalodasys turbanelloides (Boaden, 1960).

: There are six video records of Dactylopodola agadasys, five from three locations on the Red Sea coast of Egypt, and one from the Atlantic coast of Florida, US (see below). It was listed among the marine gastrotrichs for which videos were available by Hummon, Todaro & Evans 2005. Four of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009), all from Nabq S, near Ras Mohamed National Park, on the South Sinai, Egypt: #770 an adult of Lt=389 µm (LPh=121 µm), collected in July 1994, #769 an adult of Lt=369 µm (LPh=120 µm), #772 an adult of Lt=362 µm (LPh=120 µm), and the other #773 an adult of Lt=322 µm (LPh=103 µm).
I found this species in the Red Sea sites while on a Fulbright Senior Research Scholarship during 1994; thus my drawings and videos antedate by seven years its formal description by Hochberg, 2003. He had found it in eastern Australia during 2001, the species now having a much broader biogeographical range than just Austalia or the upper Red Sea. His recent report of the species from Panama (Hochberg 2008) not only further extends its range, but has implications for an original distribution that would date it back to a time prior to the raising of the Isthmus of Panama some 3 million years ago during the Pliocene. During this past summer (2010), while reviewing videos from Florida collections made during February 1991 by Hummon, Evans & Todaro, I discovered that a species, thought when collected in to be of unknown identity, was in fact Dactylopodola agadasys. It is shown in video #920 (though with unknown length).
The reason for redescribing this species is that Hochberg’s drawing (Hochberg 2003: Fig. 6) gives an incorrect impression of what the species looks like. By comparison with the photo presented in Hochberg Fig. 5, the drawing as presented in Fig. 6 is not sufficiently thin, and the TbP do not have attached cilia. Other difficulties with the drawing are that the TbA are of increasing length, interior to exterior, and not as shown; moreover the TbVL are grouped in a 3/2/1 sequence, all projecting obliquely to the rear, proceding rearward from longer to shorter in each group, and not occurring as a column of tubes that are equally spaced, though decreasing in size, as shown in Hochberg Fig. 6 (as is confirmed in one of several additional photographs given to me by Hochberg, see under this species in Gastrotrich Figures in Hummon 2009). I cannot speak to the ventral ciliation, as seen by Hochberg, but that which I have drawn in the redescription can be verified in the videos. I also can not speak to the identity of the specimen from Panama, the photo not giving sufficient detail for such an identification, but I give the author of the species the benefit of the doubt in his identification; I have myself seen the species from elsewhere in the Caribbean and made the same identification (as redescribed).
 Agadasys (Greek: aga + dasys = meaning ‘very hairy’) was named by Hochberg in reference to the numerous tactile cilia that cover the body.
 Dactylopodola agadasys is presently the thinnest member of the genus, and the only species in the genus that has the following combination of characters: a bluntly rounded head and PhJIn at U33–U32, which also has TbA 3 per side in a parallel series that increases in length medial to lateral; TbVL 6 per side (in clusters of 3, 2 and 1, also parallel and increasing in length medial to lateral); and TbP 6 per side, radiating from broadly rounded lobes, but without TbL per se /TbD /TbV.

There are four video sequences of Dendrodasys rubomarinus sp. n., all from the Red Sea in Egypt. All four are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #797 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=272 µm (LPh=53 µm), collected in June 1994 from Giftun Island SE, near Hurghada, Egypt; #800 a mature adult of Lt=258 µm (LPh=51 µm) from Main Beach Ras Mohamed National Park, S. Sinai, Egypt; #799 a mature adult of Lt=244 µm (LPh=48 µm) also from Main Beach; and the other #798 a subadult of Lt=152 µm (LPh=35 µm) from Nabq, Egypt, also on the S. Sinai. The hind-gut is often found bearing diatom frustules.
 Rubomarinus (Latin: ruber + marinus = meaning ‘red sea’) refers to the body of water in which it was found, the Red Sea.
 Dendrodasys rubomarinus sp. n. is the only member of the genus with rounded head lobes and pestle organs that are knob-like, that also has the neck constriction occurring at the pharyngeal pores, rather than behind the pharyngeal pores, and has bi-lateral testes. Two of the other four species closely resemble Dendrodasys rubomarinus, but differ in detail: Dendrodasys gracilis Wilke, 1954 has rounded head lobes, pyriform pestle organs and bi-lateral testes, while Dendrodasys affinis Wilke, 1954 [see also Hummon et al. (1998)] has rounded head lobes, lobiform pestle organs, and uni-lateral testes.

 There are ten video sequences of Macrodasys imbricatus sp. n., all from the upper Red Sea in Egypt and Israel. Four of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) in Hummon (2009): #1365 a mature adult of Lt=625 µm (LPh=200 µm) from Hamman Pharoan, Egypt; #1347 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=544 µm (LPh=232 µm), collected in July 1994 from Main Beach Ras Mohamed National Park, S. Sinai, Egypt; #1364 a mature adult of Lt=541 µm (LPh=205 µm) also from Hamman Pharoan; and #1929 a subadult of Lt=242 µm (LPh=97 µm) from the Coral Reserve, Eilat, Israel.
 Imbricatus (Latin: imbricatus = meaning ‘overlapping’) refers to the extensive overlap between caudal and frontal organs.
 Macrodasys imbricatus sp. n. is the only species in the genus with an stepped anterior, with pestle organs in the step, a long tail, and a PhJIn of U32–U43, which also has TbA 5–6 per side in transverse rows; a TbL formula of 7=0,4/2,1 (0 along the fore and 4 along the rear pharynx/2 along the rear intestine and 1 behind the anus); a TbV formula of 27=0,1/25,1; and TbP 11 per side; but without TbD. Two characters of Macrodasys imbricatus sp. n. are unique thus far in the genus: one is the rotation of the TbL series to a TbV position and the rearward duplication of the two; the other is the remarkable overlap between caudal and frontal organs. To be compared with Macrodasys imbricatus sp. n., a species would have to have a tubular frontal organ and an elongate caudal organ that overlaps it by more than half. While there are several with tubular frontal organs, few have overlapping caudal with frontal organs. Only two species may meet these criteria: Macrodasys gylius Hummon, 2010 and Macrodasys neapolitanus Papi, 1957. The former has many fewer TbL/TbV than in Macrodasys imbricatus sp. n. and those that are present do not rotate from TbL to TbV and back, while the latter has few TbL occurring in front of the caudum and no TbV.

 There are seven video sequences of Macrodasys nigrocellus sp. n., all from the upper Red Sea in Egypt and Israel. Four of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #1175 a mature adult of Lt=558 µm (LPh=230 µm) from Moon Valley, near Hurghada, Egypt; #1171 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=524 µm (LPh=172 µm), collected in June 1994 from Giftun Island SE, also near Hurghada; #1178 a subadult of Lt=360 µm (LPh=154 µm) from the Wadi ’Arabah, Gulf of Suez, Egypt; and #1886 a juvenile of Lt=209 µm (LPh=104 µm) from the Snuba Dive Shop, Eilat, Israel.
Nigrocellus (Latin: niger + ocellus = meaning ‘black eye’) refers to the black ocelli that it bears.
 Macrodasys nigrocellus sp. n. is the only species in the genus with a stepped anterior, with pestle organs in the step, black ocelli, a long tail, and a PhJIn of U31–U41, which also has TbA 7–8 per side in arcs; a TbL formula of 11=0,0/7,4 (0 along the fore and rear halves of the pharynx /7 along the rear intestine and 4 behind the anus), a TbV formula of 14=0,1/13,0 (mostly aggregated to the rear); and TbP 10 per side; but without TbD. There are three species that have mitten-shaped frontal organs: Macrodasys caudatus Remane, 1924 (though the specimen as originally described did not show a frontal organ), Macrodasys pacificus Schmidt, 1974 and Macrodasys meristocytalis Evans, 1994, none of which has black eye spots. No species yet described in this genus has black ocelli, but Macrodasys sp. Gerlach (1961: p.474, Fig. 3ab) from the Maldive Islands has such ocelli, and shows some characters that are similar (Fig. 9) to those of Macrodasys nigrocellus sp. n., namely the TbA, pestle organs and ocelli, though other characters such as the location of the testes and of the adhesive tubes make one wish that Gerlach had completed the entire drawing, rather than just the front half so that we might have seen the accessory reproductive organs.

 There are 25 video sequences of Macrodasys scleracrus sp. n. most from the upper Red Sea in Egypt and Israel, but some as well from the eastern Mediterranean Sea and from Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands. Ten of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009), seven from Egypt and three from Hawaii (collected by the author in 1994 and 2000/2003, respectively): from Egypt are #1320 a mature adult of Lt=800 µm (LPh=300 µm) from Abu Ramada, near Hurghada; #1315 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=635 µm (LPh=207 µm), collected in July 1994 from Nabq S, S. Sinai; #1314 a mature adult of Lt=540 µm (LPh=159 µm) from West Gate, Ras Mohamed NP, S. Sinai; #1311 a mature adult of Lt=438 µm (showing reproductive organs) from Na’ama Bay, S. Sinai; #1316 a barely mature adult of Lt=394 µm (LPh=161µm) also from Nabq S; #1319 a subadult of Lt=215 µm (LPh=110µm) also from Abu Ramada, near Hurghada; and #1321 a juvenile of Lt=135 µm (LPh=70 µm) from Ras Sudr. From Hawaii are #2550 a mature adult of Lt=553 µm (LPh=262 µm) from Ka’a’awa Beach, Oahu; #2565 a subadult of Lt=407 µm (LPh=213 µm) from Penaluu Beach, Oahu; and #2551 a juvenile of Lt=135 µm (LPh=70 µm) from Ka’a’awa Beach, Oahu. This is the only new species of Macrodasys that occurs both on the Red Sea (IndoPacific Ocean) side and on the Mediterranean Sea side of the Suez Canal; it might be a Lessepsian migrant, since each of its Mediterranean occurrences occurs west of the openings of the Suez Canal, the direction of prevailing currents.
 Scleracrus (Greek: scleros + akros = meaning ‘hard, tough summit, peak’) refers to the refringent cuticular nozzle cap on the frontal organ.
 Macrodasys scleracrus sp. n. is the only species in the genus with a stepped anterior, with pestle organs in the step, a medium tail, and a PhJIn of U29–U47, which also has TbA=7–8 per side in arcs; a TbL formula of 11=0,2/9,0 (0 along the fore half and 2 along the rear half of the pharynx/9 along the rear intestine and 0 behind the anus); a TbV formula of 14=0,0/14,0; and TbP=11–12 per side, with TbD absent.
Several species have frontal organs that are tipped by a small cuticular nozzle: Macrodasys achradocytalis Evans, 1994; Macrodasys cunctatus Wieser, 1957; Macrodasys fornerisae Todaro & Rocha, 2004; Macrodasys gerlachi Papi, 1957; Macrodasys imbricatus sp. n., Macrodasys syringodes Hummon, 2010; and Macrodasys thuscus Luporini, Magagnini & Tongiorgi, 1973, but only Macrodasys sp. A of Schmidt (1974: Figs. 5, 6) shows an animal that has a full cuticular cap (Schmidt: Fig. 6D, not Fig. 5D). Todaro (personal communication) has seen specimens from Santa Cruz, one of the Galapagos islands from which Schmidt reported Macrodasys sp. A., which he holds “can without a doubt be attributed to that species”, notwithstanding that Schmidt erred in his contention that testes originated well forward in the pharygeal region rather than at the pharynx-intenstinal junction where they usually occur. Todaro holds that Macrodasys scleracrus cannot be Schmidt’s Macrodasys sp. A because of differences in the shape of the caudal organ and the shape of the nozzle of the frontal organ, and differences between the two species with regard number and arrangment of the adhesive tubes of the TbL series. While I have not seen specimens from Schmidt’s collecting areas, I note that his TbL arrangement is confused by the composite habitus drawing of Schmidt that does not distinguish dorsal from ventral features, that the caudal organ in Macrodasys scleracrus sp. n. is somewhat variable, and that the new species was found several times on Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands. In my estimation, the reproductive similarities of the frontal organ outweighs other differences, and argues that Macrodasys sp. A may be a variant of Macrodasys scleracrus sp. n.

 There are eight video sequences of Urodasys toxostylis sp. n., all from the upper Red Sea in Egypt and Israel. Six of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #1904 a mature adult of L trunk=480 µm (LPh=164, L tail=1200 µm) from the Coral Reserve (Eilat), Israel; #931 a mature adult of L trunk=438 µm (LPh=174, L tail=972 µm) from Na’ama Bay, S.

The tail may reach 4 × the length of the trunk, but is sometimes broken to lengths even shorter than that of the trunk.
 Toxostylis (Greek: toxo + stylos = meaning ‘bow shaped column’) referring to the bowed shape of the reproductive stylet in the caudal organ.
 Urodasys toxostylis sp. n. is the only species in the genus with an bluntly ovate head, pestle organs, a tail up to 4 times the length of the trunk, and a PhJIn of U32–U46, which also has TbA 7 per side in transverse rows and longitudinal columns; a TbL formula of 4=0,0/4 (0 along the fore and 0 along the rear pharynx and 4 along the intestine); a TbVL formula of 4=2,0/2; a TbD formula of 5=1,0/4; and TbP=10 or more per side, depending on the tail length, with TbV absent. There are several stylet-bearing species that are morphologically close to Urodasys toxostylis sp. n., all western Atlantic. Urodasys cornustylis Schoepfer-Sterrer, 1974 differs from Urodasys toxostylis sp. n. in having a stylet with an asymmetrical opening; Urodasys nodostylis Schoepfer-Sterrer, 1974 differs in having a stylet with a sharp nearly perpendicular angle at its base; Urodasys calicostylis Schoepfer-Sterrer, 1974 differs in having a stylet that lacks a bulb and narrows too quickly from its conical end-piece; and Urodasys remostylis Schoepfer-Sterrer, 1974 has a stylet that bears a false bulb, though the outer surface does not really indent.

 There are three sequences of Tetranchyroderma corallium sp. n., all are from the upper Red Sea of Egypt. These are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009) #1519 a mature adult of Lt=332 µm (LPh=110 µm) from the Wadi ’Araba, Egypt; #1518 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=280 µm (LPh=85 µm), collected in July 1994 from Middle Garden, off Ras Mohamed National Park, S. Sinai, Egypt; and #1516 a subadult of Lt=156 µm (LPh=79 µm) also from Middle Garden.
 The species is named with reference to the coralline-calcareous sediment in which it was always found.
 Tetranchyroderma corallium sp. n. is the only small species in the genus without pestle organs, tentacles or lobes, a PhJIn at U29–U33, 6 cirrata of similar size and spacing per side, and pentancres twice as long as wide, with a more elongate central tine, which also has TbA 7 per side in three rows of 2, 3 and 2 tubes; TbVL 17 per side, solitary tubes at U08 and U80, and two groups of 11 at U25–U71 and 5 at U86–U95; TbV 3 per side, 1 at U65 and 2 at U72; TbDL 4 per side at U13, U47, U64 and U80; TbP 3 per side as ‘two fingers and a thumb’ on small pedicles supplemented by the last of the dorsal cirrata, and 5 additional tubes in the space between pedicles. There are only two pentancrous species, whose central tine is longer than the other tines: Tetranchyroderma polyacanthus (Remane, 1926) and Tetranchyroderma tanymesathrum Hummon, Todaro, Balsamo & Tongiorgi, 1996, neither of which have the TbD or TbV that are present in Tetranchyroderma corallium sp. n.

Sinai, Egypt; dorsal with pentancrous surface (over half of the body), dorsal and lateral body cilia, and TbDL; ventral with digestive and reproductive tracts, adhesive tubes, and the locomotor ciliary band B dorsal pentancre C the strange finger-like structure that protrudes laterally at the PhJIn; B. and C. with separate scale bars.
 Sparse in frequency of occurrence (fewer than 10% of samples), scarce to numerous in abundance (3% to 20% of a sample, sometimes a sub-dominant [sdom]); littoral in fine, well sorted sand at low water spring in a shallow tombolo, 0–5 cm depth; sublittoral in fine to medium-fine, well to medium-well sorted sand at 1–5 m water depth.
 RED SEA: EGYPT {Marsa Bareika W, ^Nabq [sdom] (28°05'N, 34°35'E) [2-videos], Sharm el-Sheikh, Wadi ’Araba [video]}.
 There are three sequences of Tetranchyroderma xenodactylum sp. n., all from the upper Red Sea in Egypt. These three are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #1517 a mature adult of Lt=332 µm (LPh=128 µm) from the Wadi ’Araba, on west side of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt; #1514 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=246 µm (LPh=91 µm), collected in July 1994 from Nabq, S. Sinai, Egypt; and #1515 a mature adult of Lt=197 µm (LPh=79 µm) also from Nabq.
 Xenodactylum (Greek: xenos + daktylos, meaning ‘strange finger’) is named after the strange finger-like appendage that protrudes laterally in all specimens from the rear of the pharyngeal region.
 Tetranchyroderma xenodactylum sp. n. is the only small species in the genus without pestle organs, tentacles or lobes, a PhJIn at U40–U35 and slightly curved pentancres, with tines of similar size, which also has TbA 4 per side, 1 medial and 3 lateral, TbVL 11 per side, 1 along the fore half of the pharynx at U14, 7 along the intestine at U39–U75, and 3 at and behind the anus at U88–U92; TbV 3 per side in a transverse row at U80; TbP 3 per side on the caudal pedicles, with the fused ‘two fingers and a thumb’ typical of much of the family, supplemented by the last dorsal cirratum, with 2 additional tubes between the peduncles, TbL per se and TbD being absent. There is no other species in the genus, regardless of their ancres, that bears such a sub-cylindrical finger-like structure as is found at the base of the pharynx in Tetranchyroderma xenodactylum sp. n.

There are eight video sequences of Paraturbanella levantia sp. n., all from the eastern Mediterranean Sea in Cyprus, Egypt and Israel. Five of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #975 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=657 µm (LPh=168 µm), collected in April 1994 from Bir Mesud, near Alexandria, Egypt; #976 a mature adult of Lt=635 µm (LPh=163 µm) from Coral Bay, Cyprus; #974 a subadult of Lt=400 µm (LPh=138 µm) from Cleopatra Beach, in Alexandria; #972 a subadult of Lt=335 µm (LPh=127 µm) from Mamura, near Alexandria; and the other, #971 a juvenile of Lt=211 µm (LPh=96 µm) also from Mamura. The Cleopatra specimen alone showed a caudal cone; others had an associated gland, but no protruding cone. Specimens often bear a variety of small diatoms internally. [*Note: some proposed species names were included in the prototype CD, referred to by Todaro et al. 2003, but were expurgated from the CD before it was made available to all attendees at the 11th International Meiofauna Conference of 2001 in Boston.]
 Levantia is named after the eastern Mediterranean region in which it was first found.
 Paraturbanella levantia sp. n. is the only species in the genus to have a narrowly protruding outwardly rolled mouth, prominent pestle organs at U04, and a PhJIn at U26–U23, which also has TbA 8 per side, the medial tube shorter than the others; TbL absent; TbD 7 per side and TbV 14 per side, all in the intestinal region; TbP 8 per side, the outer being the longest and thickest; ‘dohrni’ [Seitenfüsschen] tubes 2 per side; but usually no caudal cone.

There are five video sequences of Turbanella erythrothalassia sp. n., all from Egypt and Israel in the upper Red Sea. Three of these are available as MPEG 2 (and MPEG 1) from Hummon (2009): #1058 a mature Lectotype adult of Lt=486 µm (LPh=153 µm), collected in June 1994 from Moon Valley, Hurghada, Egypt; #1054 a mature adult of 440 µm (LPh=166 µm) from North Beach, Eilat, Israel; and #1059 a subadult of Lt=413 µm (LPh=145 µm) from Na’ama Bay S. Sinai, Egypt. Turbanella erythrothalassia sp. n. is unusual among members of the genus in having ventral locomotor cilia arranged in transverse lines.
 Erythrothalassia (Greek: erythros + thalassa = meaning ‘red sea’) referring to the Red Sea in which it was found.
 Turbanella erythrothalassia sp. n. is the only species in the genus with a sculptured head, having shallow lobes, a PhJIn at U38–U33, a medium mouth, and a body with a mid-pharyngeal neck, which also has TbA 7 per side the inner-most being the shortest; a TbVL formula of 9=1,0/8,0 (1 along the fore half and 0 along the rear half of the pharynx, 8 along the intestine and none behind the anus); with short ‘cirrata’ [Seitenfüsschen] tubes at U35; and TbP 7 per side, along the rear edge of each caudal lobe; and a caudal cone, but without TbV or TbD. The species nearest Turbanella erythrothalassia sp. n. is Turbanella pacifica Schmidt, 1974, which though somewhat smaller, has a similar body conformation and also lacks TbD; however, they differ in the numbers of adhesive tubes (TbA: 7 in the former, 4–5 in the latter; TbL 9 in the former, with none along the rear pharynx, 12 in the latter, with 1 along the rear pharynx; TbP 7 in the former, with a caudal cone, 6 in the latter, without a caudal cone; ‘cirrata’ tube present in the former, absent in the latter).
