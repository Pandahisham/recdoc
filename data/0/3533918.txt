Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) show impaired health-related quality of life(HRQoL), an important target for therapeutic intervention. Impaired iron homeostasis maybe one mechanism underlying the poor physical condition of CHF patients. This detailedsubanalysis of the previously published FAIR-HF study evaluated baseline HRQoL iniron-deficient patients with CHF and the effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose(FCM) on HRQoL.
FAIR-HF randomized 459 patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction andiron deficiency, with or without anaemia, to FCM or placebo (2:1). Health-relatedquality of life was assessed at baseline and after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of therapy usingthe generic EQ-5D questionnaire and disease-specific Kansas City CardiomyopathyQuestionnaire (KCCQ). Baseline mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score was 54.3 ±16.4 and KCCQ overall summary score was 52.4 ± 18.8. Ferric carboxymaltosesignificantly improved VAS and KCCQ (mean differences from baseline in KCCQ overall,clinical and total symptom scores, P< 0.001 vs. placebo) at alltime points. At Week 24, significant improvement vs. placebo was observed in four of thefive EQ-5D dimensions: mobility (P= 0.004), self-care(P< 0.001), pain/discomfort (P=0.006), anxiety/depression (P= 0.012), and usual activity(P= 0.035). Ferric carboxymaltose improved all KCCQ domainmean scores from Week 4 onward (P≤ 0.05), except forself-efficacy and social limitation. Effects were present in both anaemic andnon-anaemic patients.
HRQoL is impaired in iron-deficient patients with CHF. Intravenous FCM significantlyimproved HRQoL after 4 weeks, and throughout the remaining study period. The positiveeffects of FCM were independent of anaemia status.

Patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) suffer from a marked impairment of health-relatedquality of life (HRQoL) compared with the normal population and patients with other chronicconditions.1–3 Among the factors associated with areduced HRQoL, dyspnoea and fatigue are major symptoms of CHF that persist in many patientsdespite optimal drug and device management.4 Limited options for treatment of underlying CHF pathology have causedthe focus of therapeutic attention to shift towards patient-centred outcomes such as HRQoL,particularly in those already receiving evidence-based therapy and even more so in thosewith limited life expectancy.5,6 Currently, an improvement inpatient-reported outcomes is considered one of the main goals of comprehensive CHFmanagement.7–9 Moreover, despite their benefits insurvival, some of the usual therapies used in CHF, such as beta-blockers, have failed toprove a positive effect in terms of HRQoL.10
Iron plays a vital role in energy-dependent physiological processes such as erythropoiesisand oxidative phosphorylation,11,12 and iron deficiency (ID) may be afrequent and significant comorbidity in CHF.13 Beyond anaemia, ID is a determinant of fatigue and impaired exercisecapacity in otherwise healthy populations.14,15 In this context, thereis recent evidence that ID in CHF patients is also associated with impaired exercisecapacity, worse functional New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and poorer outcomes,although this latter observation remains controversial.13,16,17 Iron deficiency is, therefore, apotential treatment target to improve HRQoL in CHF patients.11,18
Beyond small studies, there is little information about HRQoL in iron-deficient CHFpatients and the potential benefits of iron repletion therapy. The FAIR-HF study (Ferriccarboxymaltose Assessment in patients with IRon deficiency and chronic Heart Failure) wasdesigned to determine the effects of intravenous (i.v.) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) iniron-deficient CHF patients.18Ferric carboxymaltose was well tolerated and significantly improved CHF symptoms, exercisecapacity, and HRQoL.19 In thecurrent study, we undertook a detailed subanalysis of FAIR-HF to gain specific insight intothe effects of FCM on different domains of HRQoL in iron-deficient CHF patients.
The rationale and design of the FAIR-HF study has been previously published.18 Briefly, FAIR-HF was a randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week study of the effects of i.v. FCM[Ferinject®, Vifor (International), Inc., St Gallen, Switzerland] in iron-deficientpatients with CHF due to systolic dysfunction, with or without anaemia. The main studyinclusion criteria were NYHA class II/III, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)≤40% (NYHA II) or ≤45% (NYHA III), haemoglobin (Hb) levelsbetween 9.5 and 13.5 g/dL, and ID [defined as serum ferritin <100 µg/L, oras serum ferritin <300 µg/L if transferrin saturation (TSAT) was<20%].
After 24 weeks of therapy, the patients in the FCM group experienced a significantimprovement in the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) score, NYHA class (co-primaryendpoints) and 6-minute walking test distance (secondary endpoint) compared with patientsreceiving placebo.19
Two standard instruments were used: the disease-specific Kansas City CardiomyopathyQuestionnaire (KCCQ) and the generic EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire.
The KCCQ20 is a disease-specificmeasure of HRQoL for heart failure comprising seven domains (physical limitation, symptomstability, symptom burden, symptom frequency, self-efficacy, quality of life, and sociallimitation) and three summary scores [total symptom score (TSS, comprising symptomfrequency and symptom burden), overall summary score (OSS, comprising physical limitation,TSS, quality of life and social limitation), and clinical summary score (CSS, comprisingphysical limitation, TSS)]. Scores ranged between 0 and 100, where 100 is the bestpossible HRQoL status. A five-unit change in the OSS was defined as the minimallynoticeable clinical difference in response to treatment.21
The EQ-5D instrument9 is a genericmeasure of HRQoL, comprising a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for self-rating of generalhealth (a score of 100 is the best possible general health status) and five domainsevaluating mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.In this instrument, 1 is the best possible general health status in each case; thedimensions may also be expressed as percentage of patients rating 1–3 (best toworst health status) or percentage of patients with ‘any’ complaint (scoring2 or 3 in each domain). The results for the five domains can be converted into a singlesummary index score by weighting the individual values and deducting the weighted valuesfrom 1, the value for full health (i.e. state 11111). In this study, the index wasmultiplied by 100. The minimally important difference (MID) in the EQ-5D index score isdefined as the smallest change in the index score that can be regarded as important andmeaningful for health professionals, patients, and other stakeholders. Based on data from11 patient groups in eight longitudinal studies, the MID has been estimated to be 0.074(7.4%).9,22
During the FAIR-HF study, the EQ-5D questionnaire and the KCCQ were self-administered atbaseline, and at Weeks 4, 12, and 24, before any other assessment or procedure.
Data analysis was performed using the full analysis set based on the intention-to-treatprinciple for each assigned study group. We used a two-tailed significance level ofα = 0.05 for all assessments. We present data at baseline as mean ±SD or number (per cent). Health-related quality of life data are presented as mean± SEM.
For the continuous variables, changes from the baseline value and values at Weeks 4, 12,and 24 were compared between the FCM group and the placebo group by means of repeatedmeasures analysis of covariance. The statistical model included treatment group, visit andtheir interaction as categorical variables and baseline value as a continuous covariate.An unstructured covariance matrix was used.
For categorical endpoints, differences in the distribution of the two study groups weretested by means of ordered polytomous regression for repeated measures. The sameexplanatory variables were used as in the analyses of continuous endpoints, and anunstructured covariance matrix was used.
Missing HRQoL data at each time point were defined as the following: no EQ-5D VAS score,no EQ-5D index score, or no KCCQ OSS. Missing data for patients known to be alive and nothospitalized at the time point being analysed were imputed using the ‘lastobservation carried forward’ method, for which at least one previous follow-upvalue was required. If no preceding HRQoL values were available, the patient was excludedin that analysis. For hospitalized patients unable to complete the questionnaires, or ifthe patient had died between the last time point and the planned time point, the worstreply was used for the imputation (i.e 1 for the KCCQ individual domains, 3 for the EQ-5Dsub-questions, and 0 for the EQ-5D VAS score).
The effects of baseline characteristics on baseline HRQoL were assessed by means ofanalysis of covariance models. Using simple backward elimination, non-significantvariables (P> 0.10) were removed from the model one at a time.Tests for interaction (e.g. treatment-by-baseline NYHA) were performed by analysing thedata by visit and adding the interaction term to the statistical models. All analyses wereconducted with the SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA:2000–2004).
The screening and inclusion process for eligible patients, baseline characteristics, andprimary and secondary endpoint results have been published.19 Here, we present otherwise unpublished specific HRQoLanalyses, and only show previously published data, appropriately cited, when they arerequired to understand the current analyses.
The two treatment groups were well matched for patient demographic, laboratory parameters,and treatment characteristics. At the start of the study, the mean (±SD) age was 67.8± 10.3 and 67.4 ± 11.1 years in the FCM and placebo groups, respectively. Inthe FCM group, 52.3% of patients were women, compared with 54.8% in theplacebo group.19 All patients werein either NYHA class II or II, with 83% in the FCM group and 81% in theplacebo group in NYHA class III.19The FCM and placebo groups, respectively, were well matched for mean (±SD) %LVEF (32.5 ± 5 and 33 ± 6) and the Hb level (11.9 ± 1.3 and 11.9± 1.4 g/dL).19 In bothgroups, 48% of patients were anaemic (Hb ≤12 g/dL).19
Health-related quality of life data were available for over 90 per cent of patients at alltime points. The two groups had similar HRQoL scores at baseline as measured by EQ-5D VASscore, index score, and domains, and by the KCCQ summary scores and domain scores(Table 1).Table 1Baseline health-related quality of lifeFCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)HRQoL: EQ-5D Visual analogue scale  Missing data, n (%)9 (3)3 (2)  Mean ± SEM54 ± 154 ± 1 Index score (×100)  Missing data, n (%)6 (2)1 (1)  Mean ± SEM68 ± 169 ± 1 Patients reporting any problem by domain  Mobility, n (%)245 (81)131 (85)  Self-care, n (%)146 (49)79 (51)  Usual activity, n (%)232 (77)124 (81)  Pain/discomfort, n (%)228 (76)117 (75)  Anxiety/depression, n (%)194 (65)97 (63)HRQoL: KCCQ Missing data, n (%)7 (2)4 (3) Overall summary score, mean ± SEM52 ± 153 ± 1 Clinical summary score, mean ± SEM55 ± 155 ± 1 Total symptom score, mean ± SEM59 ± 159 ± 2 Physical limitation, mean ± SEM52 ± 152 ± 2 Symptom burden, mean ± SEM59 ± 160 ± 1 Symptom frequency, mean ± SEM59 ± 158 ± 2 Symptom stability, mean ± SEM54 ± 153 ± 1 Self-efficacy, mean ± SEM64 ± 163 ± 2 Quality of life, mean ± SEM47 ± 148 ± 2 Social limitation, mean ± SEM51 ± 251 ± 2Visual Analogue Scale and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overallsummary score data were previously published, and are included here forcontext.16KCCQ, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire.

At baseline, HRQoL was lower in patients with anaemia compared with non-anaemic patients(Table 2).Likewise, symptom severity (NYHA class III vs. II) was associated with incrementally worseHRQoL (Table 2).Table 2Differences in baseline health-related quality of life according to anaemiastatus and NYHA classAnaemic (n= 220)Non-anaemic (n= 221)P (anaemic vs. non-anaemic)NYHA III (n= 377)NYHA II (n= 82)P (NYHA III vs. NYHA II)HRQoL: EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale, mean ± SEM53.0 ± 1.155.6 ± 1.10.09352.5 ± 0.862.4 ± 1.9<0.001 Index score (×100), mean ± SEM)66.2 ± 1.070.7 ± 1.10.00266.7 ± 0.876.5 ± 1.6<0.001HRQoL: KCCQ Overall summary score, mean ± SEM49.3 ± 1.255.7 ± 1.3<0.00149.4 ± 0.966.8 ± 1.9<0.001 Clinical summary score, mean ± SEM52.4 ± 1.258.6 ± 1.3<0.00152.0 ± 0.971.8 ± 1.8<0.001 Total symptom score, mean ± SEM56.3 ± 1.361.6 ± 1.4<0.00555.5 ± 1.075.2 ± 1.9<0.001NYHA, New York Heart Association; EQ-5D, Euro QoL 5 Dimensions; KCCQ, KansasCity Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire.

Age at baseline, gender, baseline NYHA, ischaemic aetiology of CHF, baseline serum iron,serum ferritin, TSAT, and Hb were associated with baseline QoL scores in the univariateanalyses. We fitted an analysis of covariance model with a range of these possiblepredictors. Through backward elimination, non-significant variables were removed. In thefinal model, baseline NYHA class (P< 0.001), baseline Hb(P= 0.02), and baseline TSAT (P= 0.04)were associated with HRQoL (KCCQ OSS).
As previously published, FCM significantly improved EQ-5D VAS and KCCQ OSS.19 In our analysis, we found that FCMalso improved EQ-5D index scores, and other summary scores of the KCCQ, such as CSS andTSS consistently after 4 weeks of treatment initiation. These effects were maintained orincreased throughout the study (FCM P< 0.001 vs. placebo at eachtime point, Tables 3and 4). The changes frombaseline in EQ-5D VAS and index scores ranged on average between 13 and 25%throughout the study, compared with <10% among the placebo group(Table 3).Table 3Absolute and percentage change from baseline in generic quality of lifemeasured using the EQ-5D instrument Week 4Week 12Week 24FCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)FCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)FCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale Missing data, n (%)30 (9.9)15 (9.7)21 (6.9)10 (6.5)19 (6.3)9 (5.8) Mean ± SEM (% change from baseline)6.0 ± 0.7 (17.4 ± 2.1)***0.8 ± 1.3 (4.8 ± 2.8)7.9 ± 0.8 (21.4 ± 2.3)***2.4 ± 1.5 (7.9 ± 3.2)9.1 ± 1.0 (24.6 ± 2.7)***3.4 ± 1.6 (9.9 ± 3.3)EQ-5D index score Missing data, n (%)29 (9.5)13 (8.4)17 (5.6)8 (5.2)16 (5.3)7 (4.5) Mean ± SEM, ×100 (% change from baseline)5.9 ± 0.8 (12.6 ± 1.8)***0.6 ± 1.5 (5.1 ± 2.8)6.9 ± 1.0 (15.1 ± 2.2)***−1.6 ± 1.7 (0.5 ± 3.3)6.6 ± 1.2 (14.4 ± 2.5)***−1.0 ± 1.8 (1.5 ± 3.2) Mobility, n (%) reporting improvement46 (16.5)15 (10.4)55 (19.0)***9 (6.1)59 (20.3)**17 (11.4) Self-care, n (%) reporting improvement43 (15.5)**14 (9.8)54 (18.8)***17 (11.6)61 (21.1)***14 (9.5) Usual activity, n (%) reportingimprovement53 (18.9)*18 (12.7)62 (21.4)23 (15.6)70 (24.1)*23 (15.5) Pain/discomfort, n (%) reportingimprovement57 (20.3)*21 (14.7)77 (26.6)***22 (14.9)82 (28.2)**25 (16.8) Anxiety/depression, n (%) reportingimprovement68 (24.3)30 (21.0)84 (29.1)*33 (22.3)94 (32.4)*37 (24.8)Visual Analogue Scale data were previously published, and are included here forcontext.16*P< 0.05;**P< 0.01;***P< 0.001 for ferriccarboxymaltose vs. placebo.Table 4Absolute and percentage change from baseline in heart-failure-specificquality of life measured using the Kansas City CardiomyopathyQuestionnaire Week 4Week 12Week 24FCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)FCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)FCM (n= 304)Placebo (n= 155)HRQoL: KCCQ Missing data, n (%)27 (8.9)15 (9.7)18 (5.9)11 (7.1)18 (5.9)10 (6.5) Overall summary score, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)9.4 ± 0.9 (33.6 ± 5.2)***3.5 ± 1.2 (10.6 ± 3.3)12.2 ± 1.1 (41.9 ± 5.8)***4.6 ± 1.4 (16.1 ± 5.4)12.8 ± 1.3 (43.9 ± 6.1)***6.2 ± 1.5 (21.5 ± 6.7) Clinical summary score, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)9.3 ± 0.9 (29.9 ± 4.3)***2.7 ± 1.2 (7.0 ± 2.5)11.6 ± 1.1 (36.2 ± 4.7)***3.3 ± 1.4 (9.4 ± 3.5)11.4 ± 1.3 (36.8 ± 4.9)***4.2 ± 1.5 (12.6 ± 3.7) Total symptom score, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)10.4 ± 1.0 (34.1 ± 5.1)***3.1 ± 1.2 (7.5 ± 2.6)12.7 ± 1.2 (38.0 ± 4.4)***3.3 ± 1.5 (8.2 ± 3.3)12.0 ± 1.3 (36.3 ± 4.5)***3.9 ± 1.6 (11.5 ± 3.5) Physical limitation, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)8.2 ± 1.1 (31.7 ± 4.7)***2.3 ± 1.4 (9.8 ± 3.7)10.5 ± 1.3 (39.5 ± 5.9)***3.3 ± 1.6 (11.8 ± 4.2)10.7 ± 1.5 (45.5 ± 7.1)**4.5 ± 1.8 (13.5 ± 4.1) Symptom frequency, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)10.1 ± 1.1 (40.9 ± 8.8)***4.1 ± 1.4 (12.2 ± 3.4)12.0 ± 1.2 (44.2 ± 7.9)***3.2 ± 1.5 (10.2 ± 3.9)11.5 ± 1.4 (41.4 ± 8.1)***4.6 ± 1.7 (17.6 ± 4.6) Symptom stability, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)12.7 ± 1.4 (32.3 ± 3.3)***1.6 ± 1.9 (8.9 ± 4.4)14.2 ± 1.7 (37.6 ± 3.9)***1.7 ± 2.1 (11.6 ± 5.4)13.2 ± 1.7 (33.8 ± 3.7)***4.5 ± 2.1 (17.0 ± 5.4) Symptom burden, mean ± SEM (% change from baseline)10.8 ± 1.1 (35.2 ± 5.2)***2.1 ± 1.3 (6.1 ± 2.7)13.3 ± 1.2 (40.8 ± 5.1)***3.3 ± 1.6 (9.2 ± 3.6)12.5 ± 1.4 (39.0 ± 5.1)***3.3 ± 1.7 (10.2 ± 3.6) Self-efficacy, mean ± SEM (% change from baseline)6.9 ± 1.3 (23.5 ± 4.3)5.7 ± 1.9 (23.0 ± 7.4)8.9 ± 1.3 (28.8 ± 4.8)*4.3 ± 2.4 (21.3 ± 7.4)9.7 ± 1.5 (30.0 ± 5.0)6.0 ± 2.4 (26.3 ± 7.8) Quality of life, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)8.7 ± 1.1 (36.8 ± 5.8)**3.6 ± 1.6 (19.8 ± 7.1)13.3 ± 1.3 (54.9 ± 7.0)***4.5 ± 1.6 (21.7 ± 6.9)14.8 ± 1.4 (59.1 ± 7.3)***6.8 ± 1.8 (31.8 ± 8.8) Social limitation, mean ± SEM (% change frombaseline)10.2 ± 1.4 (46.6 ± 8.5)**4.1 ± 1.7 (15.0 ± 5.3)12.1 ± 1.6 (55.2 ± 11.0)*7.2 ± 2.1 (25.4 ± 7.1)13.1 ± 1.7 (54.4 ± 9.7)8.5 ± 2.2 (27.5 ± 6.9)KCCQ overall summary score data were previously published, and are includedhere for context.16*P< 0.05;**P< 0.01;***P< 0.001 for ferriccarboxymaltose vs. placebo.

There was a greater improvement in the percentage of patients reporting any complaint ineach EQ-5D domain in the FCM group compared with the placebo group(Table 3).Throughout the study, significantly more (P< 0.02) patientsreported an MID in the FCM group (37–45%) compared with the placebo group(22–29%; Figure 1). In addition to overall improvement, FCM treatment was associatedwith lower rates of deterioration in HRQoL reported throughout the study(Figure 2).

The proportion of patients experiencing a clinically significant five-point change inKCCQ OSS at Week 24 was significantly higher in the FCM group compared with placebopatients (61 vs. 51%; P= 0.04). The individual percentagechanges in KCCQ CSS and TSS (Table 4) were at least three times greater among patients receiving FCM(30–37%) than those receiving placebo (7.0–12.6%), and OSSchanges were two or three times greater among the iron-treated group. Among the individualdomains, the greatest differences in percentage change between FCM and placebo groups wereseen in symptom-related domains, where improvements were mostly three or four timesgreater in the FCM group than the placebo group. Likewise, iron treatment resulted in anapproximately three-fold improvement in physical limitation compared with placebo.However, there were no major differences between groups in self-efficacy scores.
As shown in Figures 3and 4, the effects of FCM onHRQoL as measured by KCCQ were independent of a range of pre-specified variables,including baseline anaemia, renal function, age, CHF aetiology, and diabetes. The efficacyof FCM at Week 24 appeared to be affected by baseline CHF severity as indicated by NYHAclass (Figure 3), aneffect also observed in the KCCQ CSS (PInteraction=0.04), TSS (PInteraction= 0.03), QoL score(PInteraction= 0.01), and symptom burden score(PInteraction= 0.02).

Although anaemia was associated with lower baseline HRQoL in patients with ID comparedwith ID without anaemia, there were no significant differences between FCM treatmenteffects observed in anaemic and non-anaemic patients at the end of the study (afteradjustment for baseline differences) for the KCCQ OSS (Figure 3). Values at Week 24 in the FCM group[adjusted for baseline (± SEM) in the anaemic and non-anaemic subgroups,respectively] were: EQ-5D index score 74.7 ± 1.6 vs. 75.7 ± 1.6(P= 0.66); EQ-5D VAS 63.1 ± 1.3 vs. 63.8 ± 1.3(P= 0.74); KCCQ OSS 66.1 ± 1.6 vs. 64.9 ± 1.6(P= 0.61). The absence of differences in treatment effectsaccording to anaemia status was also observed for other relevant domains and summaryscores of the KCCQ that specifically capture information about symptoms and physicallimitation such as KCCQ CSS, and about HRQoL, such as the KCCQ QoL domain(Figure 4).
The primary analysis of the FAIR-HF study showed that FCM treatment improved overallmeasures of HRQoL (EQ-5D VAS and index scores, and KCCQ OSS) in patients with CHF and IDafter 4 weeks of treatment,19confirming the findings of several smaller studies.23–25Here, we report detailed HRQoL data for baseline status and the impact of comorbidities onthe efficacy of FCM treatment.
As expected for patients with CHF, cross-study comparisons revealed a markedly reducedbaseline HRQoL in the FAIR-HF patients relative to age-matched normal populations.1,26 Health-related quality of life impairment was strongly related to domainsmost influenced by physical limitation, such as mobility and usual activities, although manypatients also reported problems in pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression domains,highlighting the multidimensional nature of HRQoL.
The effect of FCM on HRQoL was significant throughout the study, with more patientsreporting clinically meaningful changes in the FCM treatment arm. Consistent with thesefindings, the proportion of patients reporting any problems in the EQ-5D dimensions wassignificantly reduced at the end of the study only in the FCM group, and fewer patients inthe FCM group experienced deteriorating HRQoL during the study, which may be important giventhe progressive nature of the disease.
The positive effect of FCM in HRQoL was consistent among all pre-specified subgroups,except for NYHA class. Although this latter observation may be, in part, attributable to thelow sample size and the apparent improvements seen in the placebo arm among patients in NYHAclass II, it may also suggest less improvement in HRQoL in patients with in a lower NYHAclass. New York Heart Association class II patients have better QoL than patients in higherclasses2 and thereforehypothetically there is less room for improvement. This interaction between NYHA class andHRQoL was observed consistently in the specific domains and the summary scores; however,there was no interaction between NYHA class and the 6MWT, an objective measure of functionalcapacity.19 This apparentdiscrepancy gives support to the evidence that the correlation between objective functionalcapacity and HRQoL is not perfect and that HRQoL measures may provide additional informationnot captured by more conventional ways of assessing physical limitation in patients withCHF.27
Ferric carboxymaltose was equally effective in anaemic and non-anaemic patients and theeffect was independent of baseline renal function. In the FCM group, the change was moreapparent in anaemic patients, but this could mostly be accounted for by their lower baselineHRQoL.
The physiological mechanisms behind the favourable change in HRQoL due to FCM treatmenthave not been completely elucidated. Transferrin saturation, a marker of iron availabilityand probably ID at the tissue level,28 was independently associated with abnormalities in HRQoL at baseline, andfurther work is needed to determine the relevance of this. There is some evidence that pooriron homeostasis is one of the mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance in CHF,13,17,19 partly due to impairedphysical function as a result of ID in skeletal and myocardial muscle cells.14,15 In this context, recent studies have shown that patients with CHF andanaemia commonly exhibit tissue ID at the myocyte level.29 Furthermore, treatment with i.v. iron may havefavourable effects in cardiac structure and remodelling.30 We can therefore hypothesise that ID impairs physicalfunction and promotes symptoms such as fatigue due to impaired energy metabolism, a commonfeature in CHF, as well as due to abnormal erythropoiesis where anaemia ispresent.11,13,17,23 These mechanisms may explain why FCMadministration significantly improved HRQoL in both anaemic and non-anaemic patients, andwhy this benefit was seen early after initiation of the therapy, after just 4 weeks, despiteonly a modest increase in the Hb level.
Health-related quality of life instruments capture self-perceived health and are a usefulmeasure of the efficacy of any therapeutic intervention from the perspective of the patientand the treating professional. This is particularly relevant in elderly patients with CHF,where trading longevity for improvement in physical, emotional and social well-being may bethe preference.1,27 Also, patient-reported outcomes have been found to beindependent predictors of outcome in HF patients; therefore, HRQoL may give importantprognostic information.27,31
There are two main limitations to our subanalysis of the FAIR-HF study. First, the studywas not originally powered for significant differences in terms of the various HRQoL summaryscores and domains, although the findings are consistent with the changes observed in thetwo symptom-based primary endpoints of the FAIR-HF study (PGA and NYHA).19 Second, the selection criteria couldlimit the generalization of the results to the CHF population at large, although thepositive effects of FCM were observed in a wide range of different patient subgroups.
In our study, i.v. iron treatment was considered to be well tolerated.19 However, it must be noted that long-termsafety data for treatment with this drug in the setting of CHF are currently lacking.Studies evaluating longer periods of treatment, such as CONFIRM-HF (ClinicalTrials.govidentifier: NCT01453608),32 andevaluation of the effect on mortality and morbidity would be desirable.
In conclusion, we have shown that iron repletion with FCM over a 24-week period improvesgeneric and disease-specific measures of HRQoL in stable, symptomatic, and ambulatory CHFpatients with ID and systolic dysfunction. The beneficial effects of FCM on patient-centredoutcomes were observed 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and were independent of baselineanaemia status and renal function. In addition to improvements, we observed lessdeterioration in HRQoL in patients treated with FCM. Further research is required to confirmthese findings and to determine the underlying mechanisms of the efficacy of i.v. iron inpatients with ID and CHF.
