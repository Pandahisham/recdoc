Position Statements


A position statement is an official point of view or belief of the ADA. Position statements are issued on scientific or medical issues related to diabetes. They may be authored or unauthored and are published in ADA journals and other scientific/medical publications as appropriate. Position statements must be reviewed and approved by the Professional Practice Committee and, subsequently, by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. ADA position statements are typically based on a technical review or other review of published literature. They are reviewed on an annual basis and updated as needed. In addition to those published in this supplement, listed below are recent position statements.
