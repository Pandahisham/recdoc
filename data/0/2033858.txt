An evaluation of preoperative CA 15-3 measurement in primary breast carcinoma.

In this study of 500 patients with breast carcinoma, we have prospectively assessed the role of preoperative CA 15-3 as a marker of disease burden over a 7 year period. CA 15-3 levels at presentation correlate with stage of disease, tumour size, lymph node status, the presence of metastases and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumour. CA 15-3 alone is not an independent prognostic indicator, although a serum level of > 40 U ml-1 has a positive predictive value of 83% for the presence of advanced disease. We recommend the routine use of this marker in the preoperative assessment of primary breast carcinoma.
