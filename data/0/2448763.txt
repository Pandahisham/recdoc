Myotonic dystrophy: relative sensitivity of symptoms signs and abnormal investigations.

Twenty-five symptoms, signs, and abnormal investigations were looked for in 20 patients with clinically-definite myotonic dystrophy. Weakness of facial muscles, neck flexors, and arm external rotators was found in all patients (sensitivity = 100%). Arm external rotation has not been reported as a frequently involved muscle in previous clinical studies on myotonic dystrophy. Careful examination of muscle strength may therefore predict which patients may or may not carry the abnormal gene for myotonic dystrophy.
