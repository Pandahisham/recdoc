Prevalence of Hyperlipidemia in Diabetic Infertile Women

The study was carried out to assess the lipid profile levels in diabetic infertile women as diabetes is often associated with infertility. 90 patients in the age limit 20- 40 years. One half diabetic and the other half non-diabetic presenting with a complaint of infertility were evaluated at the G. Kuppusamy Naidu Memorial Hospital, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. There was a significant increase in the triglycerides and VLDL(Very Low Density Lipid) cholesterol levels in diabetic infertile women when compared to non diabetic infertile women and hence this shows that assessment of Lipo protein levels is of much diagnostic importance and also one among the main criteria for establishing female infertility and diabetes is one of the main contributing factor which may cause fatal disorders like Cardio vascular diseases and Coronary artery diseases due to the vicious cycle caused by the combined vascular abnormalities associated with diabetes.
