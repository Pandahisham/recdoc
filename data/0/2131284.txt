ON THE COLLECTION OF THE ENTIRE EXTERNAL SECRETION OF THE PANCREAS UNDER STERILE CONDITIONS AND THE FATAL EFFECT OF TOTAL LOSS OF PANCREATIC JUICE

 It has been possible by appropriate intubation of the main pancreatic duct of the dog to collect the total external secretion of the pancreas under sterile conditions. When all of the secretion is thus collected exitus occurs in a characteristic way in about a week with anorexia, gastric irritability, vomiting and asthenia. The significance of this finding has been briefly discussed. A method is also described for the "altercursive" intubation of the pancreas whereby the secretion may be collected or allowed to flow back to the duodenum at will.
