SOMETIMES THEY MAY BE ZEBRAS: HERPES ZOSTER OF THE L2 SPINAL NERVE

This case report describes a relatively uncommon presentation of herpes zoster affecting the cutaneous distribution of the L2 spinal nerve. The coexistence of a previous history of leg pain, cortical thickening of the femoral shaft on plain film x-ray examination, and the absence, at the time of examination, of the tell tale rash of herpes zoster provided the clinician with a diagnostic challenge. Furthermore, this case stresses the importance of a thorough neurological and orthopaedic examination as well as careful visual inspection of the painful region.
