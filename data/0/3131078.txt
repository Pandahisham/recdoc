Review of the genus Hartemita Cameron,  1910 (Hymenoptera, Braconidae, Cardiochilinae),  with the description of six new species from Vietnam

Academic editor: Michael Sharkey
The Oriental and East Palaearctic genus Hartemita Cameron, 1910 (Braconidae: Cardiochilinae) is recorded for the first time from Vietnam. Sixteen species of the genus Hartemita are currently recognized from Oriental and East Palaearctic regions. One species is newly recorded for Vietnam, Hartemita singaporensis (Mao, 1945)and six new species from Vietnam are described and illustrated: Hartemita coffeana sp. n., Hartemita daklaka sp. n., Hartemita khuatbaolinhae sp. n., Hartemita similis sp. n., Hartemita maculata sp. n. and Hartemita vietnamica sp. n. A key to species of the genus Hartemita Cameron is included.

The small genus Hartemita Cameron, 1910 (Braconidae: Cardiochilinae) is comparatively rare in collections and easily recognizable by its enlarged hind basitarsus (Figs 5, 22, 55, 83, 100). In this respect they resemble stingless bees (Meliponini) which occur over most of its range and as suggested by one of the referees this may be not coincidence. It has an Oriental and East Palaearctic distribution, but was unknown from Vietnam (Long and Belokobylskij 2003). It comprised 16 species; of these, three are from southern and eastern Palaearctic regions, three are from an intermediate area (Nepal) and the other ten occur in the Oriental region (Dangerfield and Austin 1990, Chou 1995, Chen, He and Ma 1998 and 2004; Belokobylskij and Ku 2001; Ahmad and Shujauddin 2004; Belokobylskij 2005; Yu, van Achterberg and Horstmann 2005). As far as known all species of Cardiochilinae are koinobiont endoparasitoids of lepidopterous larvae. Extensive Malaise trapping in Vietnam resulted in the collecting of one described species of the genus Hartemita. Six additional species are new to science and are described in this paper. A comprehensive key to species of the genus Hartemita is provided.
Two recent and larger collections of Cardiochilinae from Vietnam are used for this revision: the Braconidae collection in the Institute of Ecology & Biological Resources (IEBR) at Hanoi (assembled by the first author) and the Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis collection (RMNH) at Leiden (assembled during five RMNH-IEBR expeditions in Vietnam).
For recognition of the subfamily Cardiochilinae, see van Achterberg (1993), for a key to the genera of Cardiochilinae, see Dangerfield et al. (1999) and for a diagnosis of the genus Hartemita,see Dangerfield and Austin (1990). For the terminology used in this paper, see Dangerfield and Austin (1990) and van Achterberg (1993).

The species is named “maculata”, because of the distinctly maculate mesoscutum.
Specimens from Vietnam have the hind claws with 5–6 teeth and the propodeum rugose with a faint transverse carina anteriorly. Most common species in North and Central Vietnam. Runs in the key by Dangerfield and Austin (1990) to Hartemita latipes Cameron, but this species has a Sundaland distribution and differs as indicated above. The only specimen reported as Hartemita chapini (Mao) from Malaysia has been examined and belongs to Hartemita latipes. As a result, Hartemita chapini is a species only known from the Philippines.
