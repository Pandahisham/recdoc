Cephalalgiaphobia: a possible specific phobiaof illness

Psychiatric comorbidity,mainly anxiety and depression, arecommon in chronic migraine (CM).Phobias are reported by half of CMpatients. Phobic avoidance associatedwith fear of headache ormigraine attack has never been adequatelydescribed. We describe 12migraine patients with particularphobic-avoidant behaviours relatedto their headache attacks, which weclassified as a specific illnessphobia, coined as cephalalgiaphobia.All patients were women, meanage 42, and all had a migraine diagnosis(11 CM, all overused acutemedications). Patients had either aphobia of a headache attack duringa pain-free state or a phobia of painworsening during mild headacheepisodes. Patients overused acutemedication as phobic avoidance. Itis a significant problem, associatedwith distress and impairment, interferingwith medical care.Cephalalgiaphobia is a possiblespecific phobia of illness, possiblylinked to progression of migraine toCM and to acute medicationoveruse headache.
