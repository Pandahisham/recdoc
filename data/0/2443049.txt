Seeding of tumour in the needle track following percutaneous needle biopsy of liver neoplasms is rarelyreported. We describe two such cases following the needle biopsy of an hepatocellular carcinoma andsecondary colorectal carcinoma respectively. The risk of needle track recurrence of liver tumours shouldnot be regarded as insignificant. The diagnosis of liver neoplasms may be achieved by non-invasivemodalities, and their needle biopsy should be reserved for cases not amenable to surgical resection.
