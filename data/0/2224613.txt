Abnormal Intranuclear and Cytoplasmic Formations Associated with a Chemically Induced, Transplantable Chicken Sarcoma

 Thirty GRCH/15 tumors (a 1, 2, 5, 6-dibenzanthracene-induced chicken sarcoma) were examined in the light and the electron microscope. Associated with the sarcoma were two types of abnormal intranuclear lesions, one in the form of a vacuole, the other as an aggregate containing glycogen. In the electron microscope, one type of lesion observed showed an organized microfibrillar structure. Abnormal cytoplasmic formations occurred as massed clusters of thread-like or tubular material, which gave rise to small bodies with concentric shell structure; similar bodies were found associated with vacuoles.
