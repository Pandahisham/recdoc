Cherishing the memory of Professor Sang-In Kim



Prof. Sang-In Kim would have been greatly proud and happy to see us advancing the Laboratory Medicine if he could have stayed with us longer. We feel the deepest sorrow after he had left us so soon. Having strongly endured the long fight against the disease, he even attended the transfusion conference several months ago, there he smiled and grabbed our hands with his warm heart. On the day he was leaving, the spring snow was falling and the cold rain was sprinkling all over the land, mixing all with our sad tears.
He was the pioneer and godfather of Laboratory Medicine. He had laid the foundation stones on hematology and transfusion medicine in Korea. Born in a small village of southern province of Korea in 1928, he studied in Busan at the time of Japanese annexation. Having graduated from Seoul National University College of Medicine in 1955, he became a doctor with full of dreams. After studying in the pathology laboratories of University of Minnesota, he came back to homeland and worked hard even in adverse circumstances, and accomplished countless academic achievements which set excellent models for us all.
Always being generous, benevolent, and venerable, he led us with his love and planted passion and challenging spirit within our hearts. Now we are being raised on the foundation stones that he had laid. In many universities and hospitals, we are following his path and working hard to build better Laboratory Medicine.
We now wish him a peaceful journey. Just like returning from a picnic from this beautiful world, fly well to the heaven and please say that it was beautiful.
We dedicate our love and respect to our great teacher.
