Audit of the management of spontaneous pneumothorax.

This audit suggests that clinical practice in the management of spontaneous pneumothorax differs from guidelines issued by the British Thoracic Society. In particular simple aspiration was attempted in only seven out of 65 patients and clamping of an intercostal chest drain occurred in 12 out of 50 cases. Junior medical staff require more training in intercostal drainage.
