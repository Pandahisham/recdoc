THE INFLUENCE OF TYPHOID BACILLI ON THE ANTIBODIES OF NORMAL AND IMMUNE RABBITS

 The subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intravenous inoculation of cultures of typhoid bacilli did not cause, as far as could be determined, a decrease in the antibody content of the blood serum of the rabbit. On the other hand, the intravenous inoculation of typhoid bacilli causes a rapid mobilization of normal antibodies, thus increasing their concentration in the blood, to be followed somewhat later, as in the other forms of inoculation, by the production of so called acquired antibodies. No such condition as the negative phase of Wright was discovered, although especially looked for in the experiments.
