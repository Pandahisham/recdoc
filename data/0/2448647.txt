Prophylactic oophorectomy in Northern Ireland.

A postal questionnaire was sent to all gynaecological consultants and senior registrars (n = 50) in Northern Ireland to establish the prevalence of prophylactic oophorectomy. Forty three (84%) replied. 72% performed prophylactic oophorectomy (28% unilateral), 28% did not. With reference to the world literature, there appears to be no benefit from the unilateral procedure but a consensus that bilateral oophorectomy is an option which should be considered in certain cases where there is a high risk of ovarian cancer.
