Role of aminoglutethimide in male breast cancer.

Five men with advanced breast cancer were treated with aminoglutethimide (AG) plus replacement dose hydrocortisone. None of the 4 patients with intact testes responded, although 3 did so subsequently to tamoxifen. The previously orchidectomized patient responded to aminoglutethimide for 14 months. Oestrone and oestradiol were suppressed by AG in all patients, but not to the levels achieved by orchidectomy. AG produced substantial further oestrogen suppression in the orchidectomized patient and should only be used after orchidectomy.
