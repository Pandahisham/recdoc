From the Search for a Molecular Code of Memory to the Role of Neurotransmitters: A Historical Perspective

The history of the neurochemistry of mnesicprocesses can be divided into two main periods:the first (1946-1978) was inspired by the resultsof molecular genetics, providing evidence forstorage of hereditary information in the DNAof genes. Therefore, the chemical bases formemory were investigated in the macromoleculesof the brain. Such attempts wererelatively unsuccessful, which led to a secondperiod (starting in 1978) with the researchemphasizing, in a less ambitious way, the role ofthe molecular correlates of mnesic processes, inparticular in the main transmitter systems ofthe brain.
