CT scan for suspected acute appendicitis


Appendicitis is common with a 7% lifetime risk for an individual in the United States. Mean age at diagnosis is 22 years old. While frequently clinically obvious, by 2006, more than 90% of patients diagnosed with appendicitis had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed. Use of CT scans has allowed a decrease in false-negative rate at appendectomy to under 10% from a rate of approximately 20% before routine use of CT scan. In addition, the rate of perforation has decreased from nearly 30% to under 15%. In the pediatric population, initial ultrasound is often recommended, with CT utilized if the sonogram is inconclusive (Fig. 3).
Findings at CT scan, which are suggestive or diagnostic of appendicitis, include: dilation of the appendix to more than 6 mm; thickening of the wall of the appendix; enhancement of the wall of the appendix, which can be homogeneous or heterogeneous, including the stratified appearance referred to as a target sign; peri-appendiceal inflammatory stranding; appendicolith; peri-appendiceal abscess (Figs. 1 and 2). A focal area with decreased enhancement has been shown to be a reliable sign of perforation. Sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis with CT scans are up to 98% for each. When appendicitis is not present, an alternative diagnosis can be suggested in up to 40% of cases.
Axial CT scan shows an inflamed, thick-walled appendix with peri-appendiceal inflammatory stranding (arrow).
Coronal view shows the thick-walled appendix with stranding (short arrows). An appendicolith is clearly seen (long arrow).
Transvaginal sonogram in a 16-year-old patient shows a thick-walled appendix with lumen distended with fluid (long arrow). A normal right ovary is seen just anterior (short arrows).
