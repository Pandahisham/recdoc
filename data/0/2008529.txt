Some Observations on Oesophageal Carcinoma in Ceylon, Including its Relationship to Betel Chewing

A series of 237 cases of oesophageal carcinoma admitted to two thoracic units in Ceylon is analysed.
Evidence suggestive of an aetiological link between betel chewing and high incidence of the tumour in Ceylon is presented. The sex incidence is unusual in that there is a preponderance of females in the series. A significant proportion of patients were women under 40 years of age. The middle third of the oesophagus was the commonest site affected.
