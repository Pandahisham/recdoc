The mannose 6-phosphate-binding sites of M6P/IGF2R determine its capacity to suppressmatrix invasion by squamous cell carcinoma cells

The M6P (mannose 6-phosphate)/IGF2R (insulin-like growth factor II receptor) interacts with avariety of factors that impinge on tumour invasion and metastasis. It has been shown that expressionof wild-type M6P/IGF2R reduces the tumorigenic and invasive properties of receptor-deficient SCC-VIIsquamous cell carcinoma cells. We have now used mutant forms of M6P/IGF2R to assess the relevance ofthe different ligand-binding sites of the receptor for its biological activities in this cellularsystem. The results of the present study demonstrate that M6P/IGF2R does not require a functionalbinding site for insulin-like growth factor II for inhibition of anchorage-independent growth andmatrix invasion by SCC-VII cells. In contrast, the simultaneous mutation of both M6P-binding sitesis sufficient to impair all cellular functions of the receptor tested. These findings highlight thatthe interaction between M6P/IGF2R and M6P-modified ligands is not only important for intracellularaccumulation of lysosomal enzymes and formation of dense lysosomes, but is also crucial for theability of the receptor to suppress SCC-VII growth and invasion. The present study also shows thatsome of the biological activities of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells strongly depend on a functionalM6P-binding site within domain 3, thus providing further evidence for the non-redundant cellularfunctions of the individual carbohydrate-binding domains of the receptor.

Intracellular trafficking of most soluble lysosomal proteins depends on their interaction withM6P (mannose 6-phosphate) receptors [1]. Two M6P receptors areknown to occur in mammalian cells, the 300 kDa M6P/IGF2R [IGF (insulin-like growth factor) IIreceptor] and MPR46 (46 kDa M6P receptor). Studies on MPR46- and/or M6P/IGF2R-negative cellshave indicated that the simultaneous presence of both receptors is necessary for the optimaldelivery of lysosomal enzymes to these compartments [2,3]. However, M6P/IGF2R is generally more efficient thanMPR46 in mediating lysosomal enzyme transport, which is at least partly owing to the capacityof M6P/IGF2R to retrieve secreted M6P-modified proteins via the endocytic route [4].
M6P/IGF2R is a multifunctional membrane-associated protein with a repetitive structure consistingof 15 contiguous repeating segments [5]. Its two M6P-bindingsites are located in domains 3 and 9. An additional binding site forM6P-N-acetylglucosamine residues is located in domain 5 of the protein [6]. Aside of lysosomal enzymes, M6P/IGF2R is supposed to bind alsoother glycoproteins, such as latent TGF-β (transforming growth factor β) in anM6P-dependent manner. It has been suggested that binding to M6P/IGF2R is required for thepericellular activation of TGF-β [7]. However, thephysiological significance of the interaction of M6P/IGF2R with non-lysosomal M6P-modified proteinsis still largely unclear.
In addition to interactions mediated by its carbohydrate-binding sites, M6P/IGF2R also has thecapacity to bind various proteins by other modes of action, including IGF-II. The principal bindingsite for IGF-II resides in domain 11 of the receptor [8,9]. It has been shown that mice with a targeted disruption of theM6P/IGF2R locus die perinatally, which can be rescued by simultaneous ablation of theIGF-II gene [10]. This indicates thatM6P/IGF2R plays a pivotal role in the control of the biological activities of IGF-II. Substantialevidence has been provided that M6P/IGF2R promotes endocytosis and subsequent degradation of IGF-IIin lysosomes, thus restricting its bioavailability. Hence M6P/IGF2R counteracts excessive IGF-IIsignalling through type 1 IGF and insulin receptors rather than directly participating in asignal transduction cascade [11]. It has, however, beenproposed that M6P/IGF2R is also capable of acting as a signalling receptor under certaincircumstances [12,13].
Given the physiological significance of M6P/IGF2R in the control of important signal transductionevents, it is of note that the gene encoding the receptor is frequently mutated in human and animaltumours [14,15].Evidence has been provided that loss-of-function mutations in M6P/IGF2R contribute to cancerprogression, lending support to the notion that this receptor might be a tumour suppressor.Tumour-associated M6P/IGF2R alterations were mainly located in domains 9, 10 and 11 of the receptor[16–19], withthis region of the protein hosting one of the two M6P-binding sites and the major site ofinteraction with IGF-II [5]. The tumour-suppressive potentialof M6P/IGF2R is supposed to rely largely on its dampening impact on IGF-II signalling. It has alsobeen suggested that M6P/IGF2R restricts tumour progression by modulation of latent TGF-βactivation at the cell surface [20]. However, M6P/IGF2R bindsa variety of other factors that could exert an influence on the proliferation, migration and/orinvasiveness of tumour cells, including heparanase and cysteine cathepsins [21–23].
Although the growth-suppressive role of M6P/IGF2R is well documented, its impact on tumourinvasion and metastasis remains poorly understood. It has been put forward that loss of M6P/IGF2Rmay promote the invasiveness of malignant tumour cells [24].Various studies have shown that M6P/IGF2R indeed has the capacity to impede tumour cell migration[25,26].Interestingly, we have recently found that M6P/IGF2R modulates the invasiveness of liver cells viaits capacity to bind M6P-modified proteins [27]. However, theexact mechanisms underlying the anti-invasive properties of M6P/IGF2R in SCC (squamous cellcarcinoma) cells remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether the individualM6P-binding sites of the receptor serve complementary or redundant functions in the context ofanchorage-independent growth and matrix invasion by cancer cells.
We have previously reported that reconstitution of M6P/IGF2R expression in receptor-deficientSCC-VII cells improves the intracellular accumulation of lysosomal enzymes, restores the formationof dense lysosomes and reduces the invasive propensity of the cells [25]. This cellular system was now used to assess the relevance of the differentligand-binding sites of M6P/IGF2R for the biological activities of the receptor by introducing pointmutations known to selectively interfere with binding of individual ligands [28,29].
Rabbit antisera raised against bovine M6P/IGF2R, mouse CD (cathepsin D) and mouse proCL(cathepsin L) were kindly provided by Professor Bernard Hoflack (Technical University of Dresden,Dresden, Germany), Professor Regina Pohlmann (University of Münster, Münster, Germany)and Professor Ann H. Erickson (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, U.S.A.) respectively.Monoclonal antibodies against rat GM130 (cis-Golgi matrix protein of130 kDa; BD Biosciences) and PDI (protein disulfide isomerase; Stressgen Bioreagents) wereobtained from the indicated commercial suppliers.
The generation of mutant M6P/IGF2R cDNAs and their insertion into the expression vector pAHygCMV2has been described previously [27]. The plasmidpAHygCMV2/IGF2R encoding wt (wild-type) human M6P/IGF2R was as described previously [25]. M6P/IGF2R-deficient parental SCC-VII cells [30] were transfected with wt or mutant pAHygCMV2/IGF2R constructsusing Lipofectin® (Invitrogen) and then subjected to selection with hygromycin B(Invitrogen). The clones thus obtained were tested for M6P/IGF2R expression as outlined previouslyfor the isolation of SCC-VII/IGF2R wt-1 and wt-2 cells expressing the wt receptor [25,31]. The isolation ofmock-transfected SCC-VII cells has been reported previously [25,30].
Confluent cell monolayers (1×107 cells) were harvested in 500 μlof PBS containing proteinase inhibitors {1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml E-64[trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane] and5 μg/ml leupeptin} and disrupted by ultrasonication. Post-nuclear supernatants wereobtained by low-speed centrifugation (5 min at 320 g,followed by 5 min at 800 g) and then centrifuged for60 min at 35000 rev./min (Beckman Coulter 50 Ti rotor) to sediment themembranes.
Total cellular membranes were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer[0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole/HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.02% NaN3]containing proteinase inhibitors and extracted with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at0°C. Aliquots of these membrane extracts corresponding to 150 μg of totalprotein were diluted 10-fold with binding buffer and incubated with 40 μl of settledphosphomannan–Sepharose beads [25] on an end-over-endmixer for 16 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml ofbinding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After another wash with 40 μl of5 mM glucose 6-phosphate (Sigma–Aldrich), the specifically bound material was elutedwith 40 μl of 5 mM M6P (Sigma–Aldrich) in the binding buffer.
Total cellular membrane extracts (100 μg of total protein) were diluted 10-foldwith binding buffer [0.4 M KCl, 50 mM imidazole/HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.02%NaN3 containing 0.1% Triton X-100]. The samples were then incubated either with1 μg of biotinylated IGF-II (Gropep) or BSA for 16 h at 4°C on anend-over-end mixer, prior to capture of the biotinylated proteins with 40 μl ofavidin–Sepharose beads for another 16 h at 4°C [25]. The beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer and twice with1 ml of 10 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8). Finally, bound proteins were eluted withSDS/PAGE sample buffer [125 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mM dithioerythritol, 1%(w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue] by incubation for 5 min at65°C.
Western blotting analysis of M6P/IGF2R was performed after separation by SDS/PAGE (7.5% gel)under reducing conditions. SDS/PAGE (14% gel) was used for the analysis of the other proteins.Samples were denatured for 5 min at 65°C (M6P/IGF2R) or 95°C (other proteins)prior to electrophoresis and blotting on to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). Boundprimary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugatedto horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and chemiluminescence reagents [30]. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was done usingImageQuaNT v4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics).
Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained and fractionated by density-gradient centrifugation in18% (v/v) Percoll (GE Healthcare) gradients (initial density of 1.055 g/ml) as describedpreviously [32]. The gradients were divided into tenfractions which were then analysed for their activity of the lysosomal marker enzyme HEX(β-N-acetylhexosaminidase). For immunoblot detection of other lysosomalproteins (CD and CL) as well as GM130 (Golgi) and PDI (endoplasmic reticulum), fractions 1–3(heavy fraction), 4–7 (intermediate fraction) and 8–10 (light fraction) were pooledand extracted as described previously [25,31].
Cells (6×105) were resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium and seededinto 58-cm2 dishes. After incubation for 24–72 h, the cultures wereharvested by trypsinization and their cell number determined using a Fuchs–Rosenthalchamber.
Cells (3×103) were added to 4 ml of medium containing 0.3% agar andseeded into 21-cm2 dishes. Colonies obtained after culture for 3 weeks were then countedand their areas determined as described previously [25].
Cells (5×104) were resuspended in 200 μl of serum-free mediumcontaining 0.1% BSA and then seeded on top of Matrigel-coated filters placed in wells filled with700 μl of conditioned fibroblast medium [25].After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, the cells were fixed with methanol and then stainedwith Crystal Violet. After removal of the cells remaining on the upper side of the filter with acotton swab, the filters were analysed as described previously [25].
Lysosomal enzyme secretion studies and fluorescence microscopy were performed as describedpreviously [25,31,33]. Total protein content was determined eitherwith the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) or the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) ProteinAssay Kit (Pierce) as appropriate, using BSA as a standard. Statistical analyses were performedusing Student's t test, with P<0.05 being consideredsignificant.
M6P/IGF2R contains three carbohydrate-binding sites within its extracytoplasmic region, with twoof them displaying high affinities for M6P [5]. Studies onbovine M6P/IGF2R have demonstrated an important role for conserved arginine residues in domain 3(Arg435) and domain 9 (Arg1334) in M6P binding. Replacement ofArg435 and Arg1334 (pre-protein numbering) with alanine or charge-conservativelysine residues resulted in complete loss of M6P-binding activity [34]. A structure-based sequence alignment identified Arg426 (domain 3) andArg1325 (domain 9) as the corresponding residues in the human receptor [18]. We therefore prepared a Lys426/Lys1325double-mutant human M6P/IGF2R construct (M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut) as well as the respectivesingle-mutant receptor cDNAs, each of the latter still harbouring one functional M6P-binding site.Furthermore, a cDNA variant encoding a point mutation in domain 11 (Ile1572→Thr)was generated (M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut). This mutation has been previously shown to abrogatebinding of IGF-II [8,9].
The mutant M6P/IGF2R cDNAs were then stably expressed in M6P/IGF2R-deficient SCC-VII cells. Foreach mutant, at least two representative transfectants were chosen for further experiments. Theexpression levels of the different M6P/IGF2R constructs in the selected cell lines were estimated byimmunoblotting (Supplementary Table S1 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm). The receptor content of all selectedlines (1.0–2.2 pmol/mg) was well within the physiological range [35] and comparable with that of SCC-VII cells expressing wt M6P/IGF2R(1.0–4.1 pmol/mg) [25].
The subcellular distribution of the mutant M6P/IGF2R variants was investigated by means offluorescence microscopy. We have previously shown that wt M6P/IGF2R ectopically expressed in SCC-VIIcells is present in the perinuclear compartments reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus andGolgi-associated structures such as the trans-Golgi network [25]. Immunocytochemical detection of all mutant receptor forms revealed a similarsubcellular distribution. This could be verified by complete colocalization with the Golgi markerGM130 (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm).
To investigate whether the mutant M6P/IGF2R forms stably expressed in SCC-VII cells fold andfunction properly, M6P- and IGF-II-binding studies with membrane extracts of the respective celllines were performed. The M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut and Dom9mut constructs containingsingle Arg→Lys point mutations were found to bind IGF-II and phosphomannan, an M6P-containingpolysaccharide, like the wt receptor. As anticipated, the double mutant M6P/IGF2RDom3/9mut did not interact with phosphomannan, but retained its ability to bind IGF-II.Conversely M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was found to be incapable of interacting with IGF-II,whereas its binding to phosphomannan was not compromized (Figure1).
Left-hand panel, membrane extracts of SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R wereincubated with either biotinylated IGF-II or BSA prior to the addition of avidin–Sepharosebeads. The bound material was then subjected to immunoblotting analysis with anti-M6P/IGF2Rantibodies. Right-hand panel, membrane extracts of SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutantreceptor variants were incubated with phosphomannan–Sepharose beads. After washing withglucose 6-phosphate (G6P), the specifically bound proteins were eluted with M6P prior to analysis byimmunoblotting with anti-M6P/IGF2R antibodies.

In order to assess whether the M6P/IGF2R mutants are functional in lysosomal enzyme trafficking,the intra- and extra-cellular activities of the lysosomal marker HEX were determined. It should benoted that this assay does not discriminate between direct lysosomal sorting of HEX andreinternalization of secreted enzyme. In our previous study [25], we have already reported that expression of the wt M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells resultsin a markedly reduced HEX content of the medium (11–24% of the total activity) as comparedwith parental and mock-transfected cells (59–62%). A similar observation was now made forM6P/IGF2R Dom11mut-producing cells (16–21% extracellular HEX), indicating thatM6P/IGF2R Dom11mut is fully competent in delivering lysosomal enzymes to theirintracellular destination (Table 1).
Cells were cultured for 24 h prior to assaying the cell extracts and conditioned mediumfor their HEX, CD and CL contents. Results are means±S.E.M. for 3–17 independentexperiments. n.a., not analysed.
*P<0.05, compared with mock-transfected SCC-VII cells.
†HEX data taken from [25].
Interestingly, extracellular accumulation of HEX by SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2RDom3mut (23–31%) or Dom9mut (20–24%) is at best moderatelyincreased. Expression of M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut led to more HEX being present in the medium(33–43%). However, this value is still significantly lower than that determined formock-transfected or parental SCC-VII cells (Table 1). Toassess whether the improved retention of HEX by SCC-VII cells expressing mutant M6P/IGF2R is indeedrelated to the ectopic presence of the receptor, the cells were treated with NH4Cl, alysosomotropic amine known to interfere with intracellular sorting of lysosomal enzymes. Aspreviously reported for the wt receptor [25],NH4Cl treatment of cells expressing M6P/IGF2R mutants increased the fraction ofextracellular HEX to 45–64% (Supplementary Table S2 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm).
We also analysed the intracellular retention of two other lysosomal enzymes, CD and CL, bySCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R variants with impaired M6P-binding sites. Upon expression of wtM6P/IGF2R, the fraction of CD accumulating in the medium was reduced from 53–67% to12–15%. The extracellular CD fraction was also lower in SCC-VII cells expressing eitherM6P/IGF2R mutant with only one functional M6P-binding site (16–43%). In contrast, SCC-VIIcells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut accumulated only slightly less CD (48–52%) inthe medium than parental and mock-transfected SCC-VII cells (Table1).
The effect of wt M6P/IGF2R expression on CL retention by SCC-VII cells is much weaker than forHEX and CD [25], which could be related to the existence ofan alternative targeting pathway for this enzyme [36].M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut transfectants were found to deliver even slightly less CL into theirmedium (68–74%) than cells expressing the wt receptor (73–81%), whereas M6P/IGF2RDom9mut (84%) and Dom3/9mut cells (77–87%) release almost the sameproportion of their CL as their parental and mock-transfected counterparts (85–87%; Table 1).
Despite its presence at the cell surface and its recycling between the plasma membrane andintracellular compartments, MPR46 fails to mediate internalization of exogenous ligands. Incontrast, M6P/IGF2R is capable of internalizing lysosomal enzymes from secretions [37]. It has been shown that the addition of M6P to the culturemedium completely inhibits the reuptake of secreted lysosomal enzymes, without affectingbiosynthetic sorting [3]. In the case of SCC-VII cellsexpressing wt M6P/IGF2R, cultivation in the presence of 5 mM M6P increased the extracellularHEX fraction by 22% of the total enzyme activity. A similar effect was observed for M6P/IGF2RDom3mut (21–24%) and Dom9mut cells (20–22%). In contrast, theeffect of M6P on extracellular HEX accumulation in cultures of M6P/IGF2RDom3/9mut-expressing cells was far less pronounced (5%), as also observed for parentaland mock-transfected cells (≤2%). These results demonstrate that the presence of eitherM6P-binding site is sufficient for normal receptor function in the secretion–recapturepathway (Figure 2).
SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were cultured for 24 h in thepresence or absence of 5 mM M6P. Parental and mock-transfected SCC-VII cells were analysed inparallel. Cell homogenates and conditioned medium were then analysed for their HEX activity. Resultsare means±S.E.M. for three to four independent experiments.*P<0.05, comparison of treated and untreated cells.
To investigate the correlation between the expression of mutant M6P/IGF2R and the biogenesis oflysosomes in SCC-VII cells, subcellular fractionation experiments by means of Percolldensity-gradient centrifugation were performed. The dense-gradient fractions of mock-transfectedSCC-VII cells contain only little HEX activity, as already previously reported for the parental cellline [24,25,31]. In SCC-VII cells expressing wt M6P/IGF2R, a much larger HEXfraction (37–45%) was found to reside in compartments of high buoyant density, mimicking thesedimentation behaviour of the enzyme in normal cells [38].The same was now observed for M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut cells, with 41% of the total HEXactivity detected in the high-density fractions of the gradient. The subcellular distributions of CDand CL were also analysed. In SCC-VII cells expressing the wt receptor, 46–58% of allcellular CD was detected in the high-density region of the gradient, whereas the accumulation of CLin dense compartments was less pronounced (27–34%). Upon expression of M6P/IGF2RDom11mut, only slightly lower amounts of CD (33%) and CL (24%) were found in thehigh-density gradient fractions. A pronounced accumulation of HEX (36%), CD (58%) and CL (18%) indense lysosomes was also observed for cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut. In contrast,M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut cells were found to store far less of their HEX (14–21%), CD(5–12%) and CL (11–14%) in high-density compartments. Even less of the cellularcontent of HEX (13–15%), CD (4–7%) and CL (8–13%) was present in thehigh-density fractions of M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut cells, which resembles the sedimentationpattern of these enzymes in parental cells (HEX, 16%; CD, 5%; and CL, 8%). These results show thatthe capacity of M6P/IGF2R to mediate the formation of dense lysosomes in SCC-VII cells stronglydepends on the presence of a functional M6P-binding site within domain 3 (Table 2).
Post-nuclear supernatants were subjected to Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. Fractions1–3 (dense), 4–7 (intermediate) and 8–10 (light) were then pooled and assayedfor their HEX, CD and CL contents. Results are means±S.E.M. for 3–11 independentexperiments except for mock-transfected SCC-VII cells (individual results of two fractionations).Markers for the Golgi apparatus (GM130) and the endoplasmic reticulum (PDI) were only detected inthe light-gradient fractions.

†CD and CL data from [25].
Parental SCC-VII cells display an invasive behaviour when seeded on Matrigel, a reconstitutedbasement membrane [30]. These invasive properties can bedampened by ectopic expression of wt M6P/IGF2R [25]. Theinvasiveness of SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was 44–56% lower thanthat of mock-transfectants, mirroring the effects of wt M6P/IGF2R expression (48–56%reduction). These data provide strong evidence that the presence of a functional binding site forIGF-II is not essential for the anti-invasive capacity of the receptor in SCC-VII cells (Figure 3).
Matrigel invasion assays of SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were performedusing conditioned medium of fibroblasts as a chemoattractant. Mock-transfected cells were analysedin parallel. Parental SCC-VII cells were used as controls (set to 100%). Results aremeans±S.E.M. for at least three independent experiments.*P<0.05, compared with the mock-transfected cells.
We have also analysed the impact of mutations within the M6P-binding sites on the anti-invasiveactivity of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells. As compared with the mock-transfected SCC-VII cells, theinvasiveness of M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut cells is similarly reduced (by 61%) as that of SCC-VIIcells expressing the wt receptor. M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut expression reduced SCC-VII invasionto a far lesser extent (4–32%), thus providing further evidence that the two M6P-bindingsites are not functionally equivalent. Importantly, M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut cells exhibitednearly the same invasiveness as mock-transfected SCC-VII cells (≤7% reduction). These datasuggest that a functional M6P-binding site within domain 3 is fully sufficient to mediate theanti-invasive properties of the receptor, whereas the M6P-binding site in domain 9 is lesseffective. Inactivation of both binding sites abolishes the anti-invasive activity of M6P/IGF2R,which suggests that M6P-modified ligands of the receptor play a key role in the migration of SCCscells across basement membranes (Figure 3).
We have reported previously that expression of wt M6P/IGF2R leads to reduced cell densities inlate-stage SCC-VII cultures [25]. To determine the impact ofmutant forms of M6P/IGF2R on SCC-VII growth, we followed the cell numbers of the respective culturesover a period of 3 days. During the first 48 h, there were no striking differencesbetween the growth rates of the investigated cell lines. After 72 h of incubation, culturesof SCC-VII cells expressing M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut were found to contain substantially fewercells than the controls. This phenotype was far less pronounced upon expression of the otherM6P-binding site mutants, indicating that M6P/IGF2R-mediated growth arrest depends strongly on theM6P-binding site in domain 3. Interestingly, M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was similarly ineffectivein suppressing the growth of late-stage SCC-VII cultures, suggesting that this activity of thereceptor also requires a functional binding site for IGF-II (Figure4 and Supplementary Table S3 at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm).
SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were grown for 72 h under standardculture conditions prior to harvesting and cell number determination. Mock-transfected cells wereanalysed in parallel. Parental SCC-VII cells were used as controls (set to 100%). Results aremeans±S.E.M. for at least three independent experiments.*P<0.05, compared with the mock-transfected cells.
Previous studies have revealed that SCC-VII cells are capable of growing in ananchorage-independent manner when cultured in a semi-solid medium. Although the M6P/IGF2R status didnot affect the efficiency of colony formation, colonies formed by SCC-VII cells expressing wtM6P/IGF2R were found to be significantly smaller than those of mock-transfected and parental cells[25]. The same observations were now made for M6P/IGF2RDom11mut-expressing cells, demonstrating that interaction with IGF-II is not required forM6P/IGF2R-mediated restriction of anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, the median size ofcolonies formed by M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut and Dom3/9mut transfectants was close tothat of parental and mock-transfected cells, whereas colonies of M6P/IGF2RDom9mut-producing cells were only slightly larger than those of SCC-VII cells expressingthe wt receptor (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S4 athttp://www.biochemj.org/bj/451/bj4510091add.htm). Taken together, these results indicatethat a functional M6P-binding site in domain 3 is important for the capacity of M6P/IGF2R todecrease anchorage-independent growth of SCC-VII cells, thus providing further evidence for thepivotal importance of this binding site for the cellular activities of the receptor.
SCC-VII cells expressing either wt or mutant M6P/IGF2R were cultured for 3 weeks insemi-solid medium before the median diameter of the colonies formed was determined. Mock-transfectedcells were analysed in parallel. Parental SCC-VII cells were used as controls (set to 100%). Resultsare means±S.E.M. for at least three independent experiments.*P<0.05, compared with the mock-transfected cells.
It is currently believed that the functions of M6P/IGF2R in development and cancer suppressionrely mainly on its ability to control the biological activities of IGF-II. Indeed, substantialevidence has been provided that the receptor down-regulates the growth-promoting and anti-apoptoticeffects of this potent mitogen, thus preventing developmental abnormalities and tumour formation[10,39]. Recentstudies [25–27]have highlighted that M6P/IGF2R also has the capacity to reduce cellular motility and invasiveness.Whereas it has been originally suggested that this is related to altered IGF-II uptake anddegradation [40], the anti-invasive activity of the receptorhas also been recently linked to its interactions with various proteinases [25,26]. To study the cellular impact of theinteractions between M6P/IGF2R and its diverse ligands separately, we have now introducedinactivating mutations into the respective ligand-binding sites prior to stable expression of thesemutant receptor cDNAs in M6P/IGF2R-deficient SCC-VII cells, which respond to reconstitution of wtM6P/IGF2R expression with compromized growth and invasiveness [25].
To assess the biological activities of M6P/IGF2R independent of its interaction with IGF-II, wehave generated a receptor variant containing a point mutation within the IGF-II-binding site(M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut). M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut was found to be lessgrowth-inhibitory than the wt receptor under standard culture conditions, in line with studiesperformed on LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells [41].However, this M6P/IGF2R mutant is still capable of restricting anchorage-independent growth ofSCC-VII cells. Moreover, M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut improves the intracellular accumulation oflysosomal enzymes as efficiently as the wt receptor, thereby quantitatively restoring the formationof dense lysosomes. Matrigel invasion assays revealed that M6P/IGF2R Dom11mut wasessentially as anti-invasive as the wt protein. Thus it can be concluded that a functional bindingsite for IGF-II is not required for the anti-invasive activity of M6P/IGF2R in SCC-VII cells.
The impact of the M6P-binding activity of M6P/IGF2R on cellular growth, motility and invasivenesshas not yet been directly studied. However, some cancer-associated M6P/IGF2R mutations have beenfound to reduce M6P binding [18,19]. To determine whether missense mutations in the two M6P-binding domains affectthe growth-inhibitory and anti-invasive activity of M6P/IGF2R, we have produced receptor variantswith inactivating point mutations within either of these binding sites. Ligand-binding studiesrevealed that either of the single-mutant receptors is still able to bind M6P, whereas thedouble-mutant receptor has lost this capacity. Although it has been reported that the twoM6P-binding sites of M6P/IGF2R can differ in their efficiencies of delivering individual acidhydrolases to lysosomes [42], the single mutants provedalmost equally effective in mediating the intracellular accumulation of HEX by SCC-VII cells. Thesame observation was made for CD, but M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut was found to be better thanM6P/IGF2R Dom9mut in promoting the retention of CL. Secretion–recapture pathwaystudies demonstrated that either single mutant matches wt M6P/IGF2R in its capacity to act in theendocytic pathway. However, subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that M6P/IGF2RDom3mut is far less effective in promoting dense lysosome formation than M6P/IGF2RDom9mut and the wt receptor. This is possibly explained by the observation that somelysosomal enzymes bind much tighter to domain 3 than to domain 9 [6].
The double mutant M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut showed weak residual activity in delivering HEXto lysosomes. This could be owing to the presence of an additional carbohydrate-binding site indomain 5 of the receptor, which exhibits a distinct preference for the biosynthetic intermediateM6P-N-acetylglucosamine [6]. It has beenreported that domain 5 is capable of mediating the endocytic uptake of a variant of recombinant acidα-glucosidase enriched in such M6P diesters [43].However, inactivation of both M6P-binding sites almost completely abolished the capacity of thereceptor to perform reuptake of HEX secreted by SCC-VII cells. This is probably accounted for by thehigh efficiency of these cells in uncovering phosphorylated N-glycans [31]. Furthermore, M6P/IGF2R Dom3/9mut was found to beunable to support the generation of dense lysosomes in SCC-VII cells, suggesting that thecarbohydrate-binding site in domain 5 is also of minor importance for this activity of thereceptor.
We have previously reported that expression of wt M6P/IGF2R impedes the growth of SCC-VII cellsboth in vitro and in vivo [25]. Analysis of SCC-VII cells expressing mutant receptors now revealed that theM6P-binding site within domain 3 is more important for this activity than the one in domain 9.M6P/IGF2R-mediated growth suppression was almost completely abolished by inactivation of bothdomains, thus indicating that one or more M6P-modified protein(s) are, when secreted, capable ofpromoting SCC-VII growth. One candidate for this would be the precursor of the lysosomal asparticproteinase CD, which has been recently shown to act as a paracrine communicator between cancer andstromal cells in a manner independent of its proteolytic activity [44,45].
The anti-invasive potential of M6P/IGF2R forms lacking individual M6P-binding sites was assessedby Matrigel invasion assays. Although M6P/IGF2R Dom9mut displayed essentially the sameanti-invasive behaviour as the wt receptor, M6P/IGF2R Dom3mut was found to be far lesseffective. Importantly, simultaneous mutation of both M6P-binding sites abrogated the anti-invasiveactivity of the receptor in SCC-VII cells. These results clearly demonstrate that certainM6P-bearing factors are of substantial relevance for the extent of SCC-VII invasiveness. Thus lackof functional M6P/IGF2R expression possibly favours cancer outgrowth and metastasis largely byenhancing the release of M6P-modified proteins such as lysosomal proteinases and/or other acidhydrolases into the extracellular space. This notion is corroborated by our previous observationthat the lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin B contributes to the invasive properties of SCC-VIIcells [30]. Previous studies in transgenic mice have providedcompelling evidence for multiple functions of cysteine cathepsins such as cathepsin B and CL intumour invasion and metastasis [22,46,47]. However, the impact of the M6P/IGF2Rstatus on the extracellular accumulation of CL in SCC-VII cultures is only moderate. Hence thepro-invasive M6P-bearing protein(s) secreted by SCC-VII cells still remain to be identified.
