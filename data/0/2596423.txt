Burial Records for the Parish of St. Anne Soho, London, in 1814-1828

Of the deaths recorded in the St. Anne Soho funeral day books from 1814 through 1828, nearly half were for children under 5 yr of age. Relatively few persons died from age 5 to age 15, but then the proportion of deaths rose steadily to a peak in the 40-49-year group. Decline, convulsions, and inflammation account for about half of all deaths, the causes of which were often vague and inexact.
