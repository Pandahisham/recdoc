Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly known as Group B streptococcus (GBS), was originally discovered as a cause of bovine mastitis. GBS colonizes the genital tract of up to 40% of women and has become a major pathogen in neonatal meningitis. GBS endocarditis is thought to be an uncommon manifestation of this infection and carries a higher mortality compared to other streptococcal pathogens. Studies have shown that endocarditis after abortion has an incidence of about one per million. However, this figure was published prior to routine use of echocardiography for diagnosis. The American Heart Association has recently declared transesophageal echocardiography the gold standard for endocarditis diagnosis. This case report illustrates that, given the potentially devastating consequences of endocarditis, there is a need for updated studies to adequately assess the true incidence of this infection. Pending the outcome of these studies, routine GBS screening and prophylactic antibiotics prior to abortion should be recommended.

Streptococcus agalactiae, commonly known as Group Bstreptococcus (GBS), is a gram-positive coccus and only member ofLancefield group B [1]. Originally discovered as a cause of bovine mastitis [2], it is now a major pathogen in neonatal meningitis [1] and locally invasive as well as serious systemic infections in patients with chronic diseases. GBSendocarditis is thought to be an uncommon manifestation of thisinfection and is known to carry a higher mortality compared toother streptococcal pathogens [3].
We report a case of a previously healthy young woman, whodeveloped GBS tricuspid valve endocarditis after an electivetermination of pregnancy. This case exemplifies the need forstrict preoperative antibiotic use for abortions during the secondtrimester and beyond. It also illuminates our reliance on outdatedcase reports that have historically stated that the rate ofendocarditis after abortion is not high enough to warrantpreoperative antibiotics prior to the second trimester. We feel itis time to revisit the issue of whether all women should bescreened for GBS infection and if positive receive appropriateantibiotics prior to abortions.
A 22-year-old female with two prior full-term deliveries underwentan elective abortion at 15 weeks gestation at a clinic, 8 weeksprior to admission at our medical center. The procedure wasuncomplicated; the patient does not remember receiving antibioticsor being tested for GBS. Her past medical history wasnoncontributory although she reports a negative HIV test one monthprior to admission. She denies using illicit drugs, any injectiontherapy, or any recent tattoos.
One week after the abortion, she developed low-grade fever andmalaise and returned for a repeat cervical dilation and uterineevacuation. Genital cultures grew GBS, Candida albicans,and oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. She wasdischarged with 7 days of amoxicillin.
Two weeks later, she presented to another hospital complaining offever, chills, productive cough, dyspnea, and diffuse chest painof 5 days duration. She was febrile with enlarged tonsils, noevidence of cardiac abnormalities, rales in bilateral lung bases,and a benign abdomen. A sterile speculum exam revealedyellow-green discharge from the cervix; cultures were sent. Shewas admitted and treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, andmetronidazole. CT showed diffuse, patchy infiltrates in the lowerlobes with cavitations and no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.Blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in chains presumed to beS pneumonia and nafcillin was added. She left againstmedical advice and two weeks later presented to our EmergencyDepartment (ED) with worsening fevers, chills, SOB, productivecough, and pleuritic chest pain. In the ED, she was again treatedwith cefotaxime and azithromycin for presumed community acquiredpneumonia and intravenous heparin for possible PE.
On exam she was febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic, and tachypneic.Oxygen saturation was 87% on room air. She had paleconjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. Lung exam revealed diffuserhonchi and decreased breath sounds on the right. Oncardiovascular exam, her neck showed cannon v waves along with a3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternalborder. Abdominal and extremity exams were benign. There were nosigns of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions.
Her CBC revealed a WBC of 19.3, hemoglobin of 9.6, and plateletsof 81 000. D-dimer was 4540 ng/mL; beta hCG was negative. Chestradiograph showed bilateral, fluffy, lower lobe infiltrates withperipheral cavitations. Ultrasound of the lower extremities fordeep vein thromboses was negative. EKG revealed sinus tachycardiaand right ventricular conduction delay (RSR'). CT of the chest,abdomen, and pelvis revealed large, bilateral, peripheral lowerlobe cavitary lesions.
She was admitted to the ICU and treated with penicillin G,gentamicin, and clindamycin. Transthoracic echocardiogram showedestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 55 mmHg,right atrial and right ventricular dilation, and large tricuspidvalve vegetation with severe tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 1).Left ventricular ejection fraction was56%.
Blood cultures were reported positive in 12 hours with GBS,sensitive to penicillin (MIC 0.12) and cefotaxime (MIC 0.12).Clindamycin was stopped.
Throughout her stay, the patient was persistently febrile. RepeatCT of the chest, 2 weeks after admission, showed improvingpulmonary infiltrates; multiple, bilateral cavitary lesionsincreased in size; cardiomegaly with a very large right atrium andsuprahepatic inferior vena cava, along with a severely enlargedliver suggesting right heart failure.
She was treated with 3 weeks of gentamicin and discharged oncontinued intravenous penicillin G for a total of 6 weeks oftherapy. Although her echocardiograms and CT scans showed evidenceof right heart failure, she had no clinical evidence of this; itwas decided to monitor the patient closely and forgo surgery. Thepatient missed two followup appointments after her discharge.
She appeared in the ED a few months later complaining of chestpain and dyspnea on exertion. CT scan of chest showed leftdescending pulmonary artery aneurysm without clot or dissectionbut clear evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiogram inthe ED revealed normal LV motion and ejection fraction, completeresolution of the vegetation, pulmonary artery peak systolicpressure of 41 mmHg, a thickened tricuspid valve with severeregurgitation, and septal flattening consistent with rightventricular volume overload. The cardiologist evaluated thepatient and recommended her to followup for a possible tricuspidvalve replacement. However, the patient was again lost to followup.
Studies have reported rates of GBS colonization in pregnant womenof 4.6% to 40.6% [1, 4, 5]. Fifty percent ofcolonized mothers transmit GBS to their newborns [1]. For this reason penicillin is routinely recommended during deliveryfor women colonized with GBS. The incidence of maternalcomplications from GBS colonization is less well described. Ingeneral it has been reported to cause benign infections such asurinary tract infections. Previously reported serious maternalcomplications due to GBS include chorioamnionitis [6] and endometritis, which occur more after cesarean sections thanvaginal deliveries [6, 7].
According to a 1973 often-cited article, the incidence of GBSendocarditis following obstetric or gynecological procedures islow, ranging from 0.03 to 0.14 per 1 000 deliveries [5].Seaworth and Durack's 1986 article provides us with the most up todate estimation of the incidence of infective endocarditis afterabortion: about one per million [4]. The pathogenesis of GBS endocarditis is presumed to be bacteremia [8] following manipulation of the genital tract colonized with GBS [9]. In one small study of only 20 patients, bacteremia following routine dilation and curettage occurred in 5% (1 out of 20 patients);the bacterium isolated was Lactobacillus[10]. There is a paucity of current studies examining this topic. In the nearly twenty years since Seaworth and Durack's 1986article, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has proven itselfto be superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). One of theearly studies examining TEE versus TTE was in 1991. It was feltthat TEE represented “a significant advance over transthoracicechocardiography,” as TEE had twice the sensitivity of TTE[11]. The 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines on endocarditis state that “[TEE] is the preferred imaging techniquefor the diagnosis … of infective endocarditis (IE) inadults with either high risk for IE or moderate-to-high clinicalsuspicion of IE of in patients in whom imaging by [TTE] isdifficult” [12]. There is a great chance that Seaworth and Durack—relying upon what would today be considered incomplete, if not outdated, standards—missed cases of endocarditis thatcould today be diagnosed with TEE. It is also important to notethat their data looked at cases from 1940 through 1983 and thatechocardiography was not in their diagnostic criteria. They alsorelied upon published case reports in their estimation of theincidence of endocarditis after abortion being about 1 in 1million. Because the women undergoing abortions are usuallyyounger and have a high potential to be lost to follow up, this isan important issue to revisit.
Mortality from endocarditis still ranges from 20% to 25%,down from the 35% to 40% reported from the 1960s. Thedecrease is likely due to earlier detection and improved medicaland surgical therapies. However, the numerous potential seriouscomplications of infective endocarditis serve as an importantreminder of the significant morbidity associated with thisinfection. Septic emboli cause the majority of thesecomplications, including but not limited to septic pulmonaryemboli, cerebral vascular accidents, renal failure, and myocardialinfarction [13]. Other complications include congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, abscess formation—both in the heart and asa consequence of septic emboli elsewhere, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and meningitis [3, 14].
Given the morbidity and mortality related to endocarditis and therelatively easy and cheap preoperative regimen, should all womenbe screened for GBS and, if positive, given antibiotics prior toall elective abortions? Certainly, all women at risk—those withprosthetic heart valves, known MVP, or other risk factors—shouldbe tested for GBS and given endocarditis prophylaxis [12]. However, what to do with women colonized with GBS and undergoingabortions (especially first trimester) has not been discussedsince the advent of new technology. Current treatment guidelinesare based upon old literature that must be updated. Informationregarding rates of bacteremia after abortion, rates ofendocarditis after women colonized with GBS undergo abortion, andbetter morbidity and mortality data must be sought before thecurrent guidelines can be safely relied upon. Prospective studiesare warranted in order to have a more accurate estimate of therate of endocarditis after abortion, utilizing the new guidelinesof endocarditis diagnosis.
