Isoniazid and alopecia


Sir,
A recent report on isoniazid and alopecia is very interesting.[1] Gupta et al. presented a case confirmed by the finding that hair growth resumed when the drug was removed from the regimen.[1] Indeed, the isoniazid induced alopecia is a rare adverse effect. In this case, there are some interesting questions. The first question is whether the assumption for regression of the symptom after removal of isoniazid is acceptable. The rare concomitant lupus might be expected.[2] Histological confirmation might be required. Second, it will be interesting to know the management of tuberculosis and the outcome in this case after stopping isoniazid.
