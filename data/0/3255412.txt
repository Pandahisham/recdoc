From the Editor's desk


Dear All,
The journal in your hand, ‘Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research’ (JAPTR) has received wide acclaim and response from the scholars and academicians of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The journal as such is exclusively meant for promoting the research impact on Pharmaceutical Sciences, with a view to encourage the new scholars and the established ones to put forth their experiences. The journal has now been appearing regularly, with a positive response from the scholars and students alike.
I tried my level best to bring out this journal in print form, and one reputed publisher of India, Medknow Publications and Media Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, has consented to so.
The electronic journal is good, but print is read by everyone who desires to be a part of it. With this thought the present issue of the journal will appear in print form. After reading two issues, scholars related to the field of Pharmaceutical Sciences persistently demanded that the journal be published, in order to make it available for references both in research work and classroom studies.
Therefore, this is my humble submission to make it appear in print form, to enable the desirous ones to benefit from its publication.
The judgment lies in your hand and I shall wait for it.
I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the reviewers who have helped the Editor and the journal, by recommending standard articles to be published in the journal.
I cannot deny the cooperation and help being offered to me by the reviewers in the selection of articles. I am also indebted to the publisher, who readily agreed to give it a shape in print form. This deserves to be an international journal.
With kind regards and expecting your whole-hearted support.
