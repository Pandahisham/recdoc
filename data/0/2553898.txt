The increase in the detection of small renal masses (SRMs) and their best knowledge leads to a change in the therapeutic management of these lesions. The use of a less aggressive surgical technique or even an expectant attitude is the current tendency, in order to preserve as much renal function as possible. Imaging techniques are essential in the followup of these lesions. It allows us to know the postsurgical changes and possible complications due to treatment and the presence of local recurrence and metastases. Furthermore, a close radiological followup of SRM related to ablative treatments is mandatory. The purpose of this article is to reveal the imaging features of complications due to surgical or ablative treatments, local recurrence and metastasis, as well as their followup.

Several authors have reported that small incidentally detected tumors are associated with better survival outcomes. The 5-year disease-free survival rate forincidental renal tumors of <4 cm treated with radical or partial nephrectomy is 95%–100%. There is a clear  increased rate of metastases in patients found to haverenal cell carcinoma (RCC) >3 cm in maximum dimension at autopsy compared to thosewith RCCs of < or =3 cm [1, 2].
Silverman et al. [3] have established the indications for percutaneous biopsy of renal masses in patients  with a renal mass and knownextrarenal primary malignancy, imaging findings that suggest unresectable renalcancer, surgical comorbidity, those that may have been caused by an infection. Emergingindications are patients with a small (<3 cm) hyperattenuating, homogeneusly enhancingrenal mass, those with a renal mass considered for percutaneus ablation andpatients with an indeterminate cystic renal mass.
After surgical treatment, radical nephrectomy (RN) orpartial nephrectomy (PN), about 20%–30% of patients with localized renaltumors relapse [4]. The recurrences occurthree years after surgery, with a median time to relapse being 1 to 2 years. Inmultifocal renal cortical tumors, local recurrences rates following electivepartial nephectomy are from 0% to 10% with a risk of local recurrence fortumors of 4 cm or less [5]. However, late tumor recurrencescan occur many years after treatment. The lung is the most vulnerable site fordistant recurrence (50%–60% of patients) [6].Other sites of recurrence are bone, surgical site, brain, liver, and thecontralateral kidney.
There are multiple prognostic factors to predict recurrence aftersurgery. A postoperative prognostic nomogram has been published predictingrecurrence for patients with conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma [7], andit can be useful for patient counselling, clinical trial, and effective patientfollowup strategies.
Greatest tumor diameter, T stage, stage group, and nuclear grade areimportant factors in determining the likelihood of recurrence. At the presenttime, active surveillance of small renal masses is an experimental approach,but represents an attractive option for elderly patients and those withsignificant comorbidity.
Bilateral multifocal renal tumors are present in approximately 5% ofpatients with sporadic renal tumors [8]. Conventional clear cell carcinoma is themost common histologic subtype, followed by papillary carcinoma [5]. Most of them can be synchronous but asynchronous lesionsmay occur many years after the initial nephrectomy, and that is why a long-termfollowup. must be maintained.
In imaging followup evaluation of kidney cancer, CT is the modality of choice fordetection of local recurrence and distant metastases. In patients withcompromised renal function or with contraindications to iodinated contrast,gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of the abdomen and pelvis may be used. Also achest radiograph or chest CT study can be performed for surveillance ofpulmonary metastasis.
Renal cysts are commonbenign lesions and are often an incidental finding during abdominal CT, (see the appendix) [9]. If they are of fluid attenuation, lack internalarchitecture, have thin walls, and show no evidence of enhancement after IVcontrast administration, they can be easily dismissed as benign. However, theappearance of moderately complex or mild renal cyst varies and can causedifficulties in diagnosis and management. The Bosniak classification or renalcysts has proven to be a useful tool in helping to evaluate these lesions anddecide clinical management [10]. In 1993,Bosniak revised the original classification system [11] to include a subset of category II lesions, category IIFlesions (“F” for followup).
CT studies are aneffective way of managing patients with moderately complex cystic lesions ofthe kidney (Bosniak category IIF) because the absence of change supportsbenignity and progression indicates neoplasm. Alternatively, MRI may provehelpful in the characterization of these lesions and may possibly avoid theneed for followup examinations in these cases [12]. In theselesions considered to be category IIF, the followup examinations are necessaryto prove stability and, therefore, benignity. The first followup examination isrecommended 6 months after the initial examination. If the lesion is unchanged,additional followup examinations should be performed at yearly intervals for atleast 5 years, although the optimal followup period has not been determined. However,in younger patients, a longer followup period may be necessary.
45% of the patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease will have a renaladenocarcinoma, often (80%) multifocal or bilateral. Treatment must be asconservative as possible because of the multifocality and its usual low grade.The risk of recidive is very high: 30% at 5 years, 80% at 10 years,therefore, they must be followed up strictly and regularly (Figure 1)  [13].
The standard treatment for renal cell carcinoma was,for many years, radical nephrectomy, but over the past 10 years, there has beena trend toward the use of nephron-sparing surgery to treat renal cellcarcinoma. The results of numerous studies have demonstrated equivalent cancersurvival rates for patients who underwent radical nephrectomy and those whounderwent partial nephrectomy for small renal neoplasms [14–16].
The procedure can be performed by using open orlaparoscopic techniques. However, partial nephrectomy with laparoscopictechniques is a more complex operation than the traditional radical nephrectomyand higher complication rates have been reported [17].
It is important to know normal findings and imagingfeatures of postsurgical complications after partial nephrectomy, forappropriate postoperative management.
The appearance of the postoperative kidney depends on the size andlocation of the resected tumor. After partial nephrectomy for a smallperipheral tumor, a wedge-shaped defect in the renal parenchyma is typicallyvisible at CT and MR imaging. The postoperativekidney usually has a more posterior location and abuts to the posteriorabdominal wall (Figure 2). Perinephric fatmaybe packed into the surgical bed to help achieve haemostasis. This materialmay be mistaken for a fatty mass such as an AML.
To help control intraoperative bleeding, biologically absorbablehaemostatic agents also may be used. Such materials may contain bubbles or airpockets that may resemble a focal abscess. The possible presence of ahaemostatic agent should be considered if a linear arrangement of air bubblesis noted or if air bubbles maintain the same position on subsequent images. Inmost cases, the air in a haemostatic agent is rapidly reabsorbed during the firstpostsurgical week. However, in some cases, air bubbles can be identified onimages even 1 month after surgery. The presence of an abscess should besuspected if a localized fluid collection that has an enhanced rim and containsgas bubbles or a gas-fluid level is seen. In addition, decreased intensity ofthe nephrogram because of edema in the surrounding renal parenchyma supportsthe diagnosis of an abscess. Of course it is necessary to consider the imagingfindings in combination with the patient's clinical history and symptoms [18–20].
The biologically absorbable haemostatic agents may also mimic apseudotumor that can lead to confusion. Several cases have been reported onliterature after nephron-sparing surgery using gelatine bio absorbable sponge.They were seen as solid masses, with regular borders and enhancement afterinjection of intravenous contrast agent, due to the presence on granulomatoustissue surrounding the haemostatic material. In all the cases there was acomplete resolution of such lesions in an average time of thirteen months [21, 22].
Complications seen onpartial nephrectomy can be divided into vascular complications, complicationsin the collecting system, infection, recurrent tumor and complications due totechnical factors [20].
During partial nephrectomy, the renalhiliar vessels must be temporarily clamped to ensure a bloodless surgicalfield; however, clamping may injure the arterial intima and lead to thrombosis.If that complication is not recognized at the time of surgery or in theimmediate postoperative period, renal infarction and atrophy will occur.Complications related to injury of the intrarenal arteries in the surgical bedmay also occur. A hematoma may result if the suturing of transected bloodvessels is inadequate (Figure 3). A pseudoaneurysm may result from injury to anintrarenal artery at the surgical site or to the main renal artery or one ofits major branches [23–25].
When calyceal entry is necessary, itwould have to be repaired in order to avoid urinary leakage. If the repair isnot watertight, a urine leak may occur into the surgical bed. Such leakage mayhave the appearance of a simple fluid collection in the perirenal space [26], orit may have a more heterogeneous appearance if it contains blood products. Thiscomplication can be diagnosed on the basis of contrast-enhanced CT and MRimages acquired during the excretory phase, with the observation of contrastmaterial leakage from the collecting system into the surgical bed. In mostcases, the fluid collection resolves either spontaneously or after placement ofa ureteral stent or nephrostomy catheter. Less commonly, urinary leakagepersists and an urinoma forms [20].
A fluid collection in the surgical bed may become infected, and an abscess maydevelop. With imaging techniques alone, it may be difficult to differentiate aninfected fluid collection from an uninfected one. Moreover, as mentionedbefore, the presence of air bubbles in a bioabsorbable haemostatic agent mayfurther complicate the interpretation of imaging studies. However, patientswith a postoperative abscess are likely to manifest clinical symptoms and signssuggestive of infection; in such cases, a needle aspiration is performed forlaboratory analysis, followed by drainage if necessary. In addition, patientswho have undergone a partial nephrectomy may present with symptomsof pyelonephritis, which may appear as a striated or heterogeneous nephrogramand may be difficult to differentiate from renal infarction on images alone [20].
During partial nephrectomy, the liveror spleen may be inadvertently lacerated or contused by surgical instrumentsused to keep adjacent organs away from the surgical field. Such injuries may bedetected with CT and MR imaging. In addition, hernias may occur at the incisionsite and may contain portions of the bowel or other abdominal organs [26].
The most important risk factor for recurrence is the surgical stage of renal cellcarcinoma at the time of diagnosis, being for large tumors a bigger incidencethan for small ones. However, size is not of prognostic value if capsule is notinvaded (13). Patients with positivenodes at surgery relapse sooner, and factors like a high Fuhrman grade onhistopathology, and collecting duct carcinoma spindled (sarcomatoid)tumor architecture also adversely influence prognosis [27]. Recurrence mustbe differentiated from postsurgical fibrosis (Figure 4) and multifocality withinthe kidney, probably more often seen since small renal tumors are managed with conservativesurgical techniques (Figure 5) [13].
The possibility of local recurrencein the remaining kidney is the main limitation of nephron-sparing surgery inpatients with renal-cell carcinoma. Local recurrence occurs in about 5% ofpatients, and has been related to cancer multifocality, incomplete resection ofthe primary tumor, positive surgical margins, or regional lymph nodemetastasis. Some authors reported that the type of surgical intervention(enucleation, enucleoresection and resection) does not affect the frequency oftumor local recurrence [28].
Recurrence usually occurs within the first five years after surgery, butlate recurrence has been related to renal cancer and long-term followup after anephrectomy is mandatory for patients with perinephric invasion of a renal cellcarcinoma due to the risk of renal fosse recurrence [29]. Followup of these patients is usually made by CT but also MRI for selected cases, asmentioned in the previous article and, in both techniques, arterial phasescanning is essential for maximizing lesion conspicuity, followed bya portal venous phase. Owing to the increased risk of these patients foradditional renal primary carcinomas, the renal fosse and remainingkidney must be carefully evaluated looking for a recurrence.
Recurrent cancer afternephron-sparing surgery can be suggested when an enhancing noduledevelops in the wedge-shaped partial nephrectomy defect. After radicalnephrectomy at imaging, retroperitoneal anatomy is significantly altered aftersurgical removal of the kidney. Small bowel, spleen, pancreas, and colon maymigrate into the nephrectomy fosse [30] (Figure 5(a)).
At partial nephrectomy if an adequate margin is not obtained andsurgical excision is incomplete, the growth of any remaining neoplastic cellsat the resection site over time may result in tumor recurrence in the surgicalbed. Even if a tumor is completely excised, it may recur if tumor cells arespilled into the surgical field at the time of resection.
Alternatively, in a patient with multiple foci of disease, an apparenttumor recurrence may actually be an additional preexistent renal cell carcinomathat either was not depicted at preoperative imaging studies or was notidentified intraoperatively [23]. The surgical field of view during laparoscopicpartial nephrectomy is limited, and the surgeon can see only a small portion ofthe kidney. This limitation may lead to a failure to identify a specific smallrenal tumor if there is more than one small lesion in the vicinity. Unlessprevious imaging studies are carefully reviewed, the latter then might bemisidentified as a recurrent lesion.
The radiologicpresentation of a recurrent renal carcinoma after surgery appears as anenhancingmass in the surgical site. The recurrence often involvesthe quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles andcan displaceor invade nearby structures, even the spine. The cephalic extent mayreach the adrenal bed or may involve the ipsilateral adrenal glandif the latter was spared at the time of nephrectomy [31].
Moreover, as mentionedearlier, bioabsorbable haemostatic agents may be seen as pseudotumor, so, aclose followup examination is required to see the evolution.
Early detection of arecurrence following initial treatment is mandatory for anysurveillance protocol, and it is essential to review the preablation andablation images for a good interpretation of followup images.Imaging must be carefully evaluated to determine the initial tumor size, tumorlocation, and electrode placement in an effort to predictare asthat are likely to demonstrate recurrence. Eccentric electrodeplacementwithin a mass is likely to result in residual disease at the tumormargin farthest from the ablation device tip. Occasionally,a new tumor focus may develop.
As with localrecurrence, residual tumor is suggested when enhancing nodules or crescents areasnoted in the vicinity of the treated tumor on contrast enhanced CT or MRimages. Furthermore, gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weightedsubtraction MR images are helpful in demonstrating subtle areas ofenhancement by eliminating the high signal intensity often presentwithin the tumor on unsubtracted images. Because the ablation zonefollowing RF ablation typically has low signal intensity onT2-weighted MR images, a new or enlarging focus of hyperintensity onthese images may also be a sign of viable tumor.
Ablated tumors remainstable in size or involute over time on followup images. Therefore,an increase in tumor size after the acute postablation changes haveresolved should raise concernfor tumor recurrence, as well as within the renal vein and inferior vena cava, even in theelectrode insertion site [30].
There has been a clear increase in the incidence of RCC during the past 10 years, asa result of an increased rate of incidental detection of renal neoplasm. It hasbeen reported that radiofrequency ablation can completely destroy renalcancers, while transmitting minimal collateral damage to surrounding renalparenchyma [32].
Radiofrequency ablation is a safeeffective treatment for small renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) in selected patientswho are not good operative candidates. Small size and noncentral location arefavorable tumor characteristics (large tumors can sometimes be successfullytreated but could result in an increased risk of residual RCC). After ablation,computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is used to confirm completeeradication or the presence of residual unablated tumor. When the appearance ofthe ablated tumor deviates from expected findings, percutaneous biopsy isnecessary to further evaluate the ablation zone [33].
All patients must undergo contrast-enhanced imaging (MRI or CT) beforeradiofrequency ablation as a baseline comparison for subsequent imaging afterablation (initial tumor control).
CT scan of the kidney must be obtainedimmediately after the ablation session to assess tumor destruction. Normaltissue shows enhancement, with no enhancement in treated area, whichencompasses tumor. Small gas bubbles are seen in area of treatment, this is anexpected finding resulting from tissue boiling during ablation [34]. Afterablation an initial CT scan, imaging followup without and with contrast agentmust be performed after 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months and subsequent followupwill depend on the clinical condition of the patient and the comorbidconditions, generally at 6 to 12 month interval. Enhancement of any portion ofthe tumor must be considered residual viable tumor, and the absence ofenhancement as no evidence of disease (complete necrosis and thus completelyablated tumor). Images must also be reviewed for the presence of any newmetastatic disease or new renal cell carcinomas [34, 35].
A considerable number of patients of eligible patients cannot receive contrastagents that contain iodine because of preexisting impaired renal function orsevere contrast material allergies. These patients are usually referred forcontrast enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the kidney. As in CTimaging, followup MR imaging must be performed in all patients immediatelyafter the completion of the RF ablation. At T2-weighted fast SE imagesperformed, the ablation zone, in all cases appear as a round or ovoidhypointense region that replaces the intermediate or high signal intensitytumor seen on the preablation image. The hypointense thermal ablation zone issurrounded by a bright rim with a well-defined outer border. Thin rimenhancement is noted in all contrast-enhanced MR images [36].
Followup MR imaging must beperformed every 3 months during the first year after ablation and every 6months thereafter.
Tumor recurrence is defined as theappearance of hyperintense soft-tissue signal within the ablation zone or alongits margin on T2-weighted or STIR MR images or as areas of abnormal contrastenhancement within the treated region on the postcontrast images [37].
Concomitantly with the change in presentation of renalmasses there is a paradigm shift in the management of localized small renallesions. Minimally invasive options such as cryoablation have emerged as analternative surgical option for selected patients. The potential complicationsof nephron-sparing kidney surgery make renal cryoablation an appealing optionin high-risk surgical populations.
Cryoablation requires real-timemonitoring of the ice ball by ultrasound,CT, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to ensure that the tumour is completely frozenand to minimize injury to the surrounding healthy tissue. However, it ispreferable to use the MR imaging guidance to monitor in real time so that the entire circumference ofthe treatment effects can be viewed during the procedure.
The MR imaging protocol is limited to the abdomenand included: transverse T2-weighted, transverse T1-weighted sequences, andtransverse fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences before and four phases afterthe intravenous administration of contrast medium.
The purpose of the cryotherapy isnot the excision of the tumor, but their necrosis “in situ.” The effects ofrenal cryoabation on the kidney have been studied in animal models [38].
The acutehistologic changes are rapid coagulation necrosis and a sharp zone oftransition within the normal kidney. A peripheral zone of incomplete necrosissurrounds the area of necrosis. Over time, resorption of cellular debris andfibrosis lead to shrinkage of the cryolesion.
Given that the renal lesions are treated “insitu,” a rigourous followup is required, usually with MR. Data form long-termfollowup examinations are crucial to asses the usefulness of cryotherapy anddetecting tumor recurrence.
MR imaging and the same protocolused prior to the treatment areperformed also at 24–48 hours after treatment, for assessment of complications(bleeding or urinoma).
Remer and coworkers [39] reportedseveral characteristic findings in serial MR scans performed on the first day,1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after renal cryoablation. MR images arealso compared with the pretreatment MR images, to determine the amount ofcryonecrosis, defined as tissue that no longer appeared to be enhanced byintravenous contrast material.
The signal intensities of cryolesionson T1-and T2-weighted images were somewhat variable. Lesions were generallyisointense on T1-weighted images and iso-or hypointense on T2. The borders ofcryolesions were well depicted on T2-weighted images because of the relativehypointensity of the lesion compared with normal renal parenchyma.
In patients without evidence of tumor recurrence, all cryolesions showed adramatic progressive decrease in size over time (63% and 94% at 1 month and 1 year,resp.). Some cryolesions had a peripheral hypervascularized rim on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced images. This was seen in up to 50% of lesionsimaged within the first 3 months after ablation, but was present in just 10% oflesions at 12 months. Initial rim enhancement has been reported in liverablation cases and has been attributed to the inflammatory response.
Any increase in size of a cryolesion should be viewed with suspicion.
Although MR is the most studiedmethod of monitoring cryolesions, CT has also been evaluated [40]. The cryolesions on followup CTshowed no evidence of enhancement and the tumor demonstrate stable size ordecease in size.
