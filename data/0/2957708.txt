GENOMIC IMPRINTING IN BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER

With recent advances in molecular genetics, a new mechanism proposed for the inheritance of Bipolar Disorder is Genomic Imprinting or Parent of Origin Affect. In this study of 79 consecutive first episode manic patients, predominantly male, we failed to establish the phenomenon of imprinting. With other proposed non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance, it may be that bipolar disorder is genetically heterogenous.
