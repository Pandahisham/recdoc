SUMMATION OF DISSIMILAR STIMULI APPLIED TO LEAFLETS OF SENSITIVE BRIER (SCHRANKIA)

 1. The pinn√¶ of sensitive brier or Schrankia are favorable for demonstrating summation of dissimilar stimuli. 2. The demonstration was made as follows: A time of day was chosen when the closure of a single proximal leaflet did not provoke closure of the next distal leaflet. An irritating gas was applied to the pinna. A few seconds later, a single leaflet was touched; it closed, induced closure of the next distal leaflet, and inaugurated a wave of closure which proceeded until all leaflets on the same side of the mid-rib were closed.
