Progressive Supranuclear Palsy-Like Syndrome After Aortic Aneurysm Repair: A Case Series

The syndrome of progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome is a rare complication of ascending aortic aneurysm repair. We report two patients with videos and present a table of prior reported cases. To our knowledge there is no previously published video of this syndrome. The suspected mechanism is brainstem injury though neuroimaging is often negative for an associated infarct. We hope our report will increase recognition of this syndrome after aortic surgery, especially in patients with visual complaints.

We present and demonstrate by video two unusual patients with a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome following ascending aortic aneurysm repair. While previous patients have been reported with the disorder, to our knowledge no video has been published. The rarity of the condition and the availability of videos of both patients may be of value to readers of the journal.
A 25-year-old man with a family history of medial arterial dissections developed severe dysarthria and severe saccadic gaze palsy after a complicated repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm (Video 1). He noticed his impaired vision in the days following the repair. He was completely unable to generate saccades, and navigated by turning his head to fix a target and then tracking it. Mild parkinsonism with masked facies was also present. He also had a slight delay in reopening his eyes after forcefully closing them, suggestive of dystonia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum and left frontal lobe. He ultimately succumbed 2 years later to a chronic bacterial infection of the chest cavity.
The patient is unable to initiate horizontal or vertical saccades. However, tracking his cellphone with auditory cues enabled the patient to look in all directions. Mild facial masking and dystonia are also present.
Our second patient, a 53-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, underwent two sequential repairs of a dissecting ascending aortic aneurysm. After his first repair, he had right occipital infarct seen on MRI and several transient ischemic attack-like episodes. During the following 6 weeks he developed prominent dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait imbalance with a left homonymous hemianopia. After his second repair for progressive dilatation of the proximal descending thoracic aorta, he had progression of his neurologic symptoms, becoming nearly anarthric and also requiring a walker to walk. He had no response to Sinemet 25/100 mg three times daily. A horizontal and vertical saccadic gaze palsy was present; however, there was some preservation of ability to generate rightward voluntary eye movements (Video 2). He had bilateral dysmetria on the finger-to-nose test. No rest tremor or bradykinesia was found, though he had mildly spastic tone. Brain MRI was significant for a right occipital infarct only.
The patient demonstrates facial masking and a mild quizzical stare. He demonstrates a saccadic gaze palsy, with inability to look left or vertically on command. Rightward eye movements are possible, but attempts at saccades demonstrate severe slowing.
The syndrome of saccadic gaze palsy with parkinsonism is a rare and devastating complication of ascending aortic aneurysm repair.1,2 Although some patients have been reported with infarcts in the pons, substantia nigra, centrum semiovale, frontal subcortex, striatum, corona radiata, internal capsule, and basal ganglia,3 the saccadic gaze palsy is due to brainstem injury.4 Saccadic gaze palsy is characterized by slow, hypometric saccades and absent quick phases of optokinetic nystagmus, with intact vestibular ocular reflexes. Vertical saccades may be affected in isolation, though both vertical and horizontal saccades are typically impaired. As in most cases (summarized in Table 1), our patients’ MRIs did not reveal a brainstem injury, likely because of insufficient imaging resolution.5 Importantly, one of our cases did have an occipital infarction as evidence of posterior circulation ischemia. The mechanism of injury in this syndrome remains unclear, although a perioperative ischemic stroke from embolism, hypothermia protocol, hypotension, hyperviscosity, or cardiopulmonary bypass is possible.6 A possible location of embolism may be in the posterior thalamo-subthalamic paramedian artery, a branch of the proximal posterior cerebral artery, which supplies an area of the rostral midbrain that is crucial to generation of vertical saccades.4 Because it is difficult to unify the constellation of supranuclear gaze palsy with dysarthria, dysphagia, and gait imbalance into a single infarct, multiple embolic infarcts are likely. Many cases involved surgery of the ascending aorta, suggesting multiple micro-emboli to the posterior circulation that may have been too small to generate symptoms in the anterior circulation. This syndrome is usually permanent, and symptomatic treatment is rarely successful, although treatment with levodopa, dopamine agonists, and anticholinergic agents has been attempted.

Whether or not this devastating syndrome can be prevented is still uncertain, as is the possibility that more limited forms of the syndrome may be more common, perhaps overlooked in the immediate postoperative state. To improve accurate diagnosis, dynamic eye movements such as saccades should be assessed in any patient with visual complaints after aortic artery surgery.
