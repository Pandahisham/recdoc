 Foodborne illness presents a public health challenge in USA. There is an urgent need for the federal government and food industries to expand efforts to prevent any food contamination that potentially could be harmful to human health. The Food Safety Laboratory (FSL), ARS, USDA, is one of theleading laboratories for the development of optoelectronic sensing technologiesand methodologies, successfully demonstrating several cutting-edge systems fordetection and inspection of food quality, safety, sanitation, and security. Thesensing technologies and systems include Raman, fluorescence, and visible/near infraredreflectance spectroscopies, as well as hyperspectral and multispectral imaging.A brief overview of the FSL approaches for food safety research and development in addition to applications of rapid hyperspectral and multispectralimage-based online safety inspection for apples and chicken carcasses ispresented.
We have developed a portable bread-boardinstrument and the associated protocols creating a system for the detection ofpathogens in food products. Existing detection techniques are not adequate toallow for the timely detection of pathogenic microorganisms in the food supplybut more importantly require significant operator assistance. The instrumentthat we have developed has automatic fluid and thermal control as well as integratedfluorescence detection, all incorporated into a desktop platform. Homogenousdetection of target is accomplished in “real time” by continuously monitoringthe fluorescence during PCR using the DNA binding dye SYBR Green oralternatively the TaqMan 5′ nuclease system; the latter of which will allow formultiple target (and internal control) integration. Nucleic acid purificationand PCR amplification/detection have been combined and optimized into a singlemonolithic silicon microchip in addition to magnetic bead capture in a separatebut linked region of the chip. Optical detection is being advanced toeventually incorporate the simultaneous detection of multiple emissionwavelengths. Detection levels of less than 102 Bacillus				anthracis cells are being routinely obtained with a total detection time of less than onehour. The robust nature of this system has been demonstrated by the developmentof detection systems for Leishmania, Staphylococcus, Listeria and other target pathogens.
A new approach to high-speed comprehensive 2DLC (LCxLC)based on the use of ultra-fast high-temperature gradient elution-reversed phasechromatography is described. Entirely conventional gradient elutioninstrumentation and columns are assembled in a system which develops a totalpeak capacity of about 2000 in 30 minutes; this is equivalent to nearly 1peak/second. Each first-dimension peak is sampled two or three times asevidenced by the presence of the corresponding peaks in two or three consecutivechromatograms from the second-dimension column. Application to the separationof the low molecular weight components of wild type and mutant maize seedlingsindicates the presence of more than 200 peaks in a 2D separation carried out ata time scale of 30 minutes. Compelling illustrations of the analytical prowessof fast high-temperature 2DLC are evident in the clear presence of seven distinctpeaks in a single second-dimension chromatogram from a single quite narrowfirst-dimension peak and the great power of 2DLC to solve the “analyticdynamic range” problem inherent in the measurement of small peaksneighboring a gigantic peak. A number of problems remain including the generalquestion of the optimization of the peak capacity per unit time, choosing theright pairs of columns and achieving desirable baseline characteristics. Themajor challenge will be how to deal with the huge amount of data generated in ashort period of time and turning it into information relevant to the problem athand. Applications to the separation of a variety of complex mixtures (coffee,wine, urine) will be shown. The principal novel finding is that 2DLC produces higher peakcapacity and more actual peaks in a real mixture become evident in 2DLC ascompared to fully optimized gradient elution 1DLC in as short a time as 10minutes.
A secure extranet application has been developed to serveour pharmaceutical clients. This browser-based utility will allow clients toview sample information and reports, and test data online as soon as resultshave been authorized. This includes scanned copies of actual notebook pagesassociated with authorized tests as well as chromatographic data. Theapplication was designed in conjunction with our clients to maintain security,facilitate flow of information, and to provide unlimited access to data in atimely manner.
Micro total analysis system (μTAS) is an analytical devicethat miniaturizes laboratory functions within one device. These devices areoften used in environmental analysis, genomics, proteomics, and biomedicalanalysis. By reducing the size of the analytical system, it reduced theanalytes' consumption, improved throughput, and enabled inexpensive mass productionof microanalytical instruments [1]. In addition, μTAS provides thepossibility of performing separations and detection within a single device. Todate, detection methods such as spectroscopic, electrochemical, andelectrochemiluminescence are widely used as end or post column detectors [2, 3].
We are looking at using in-channel electrode detection formonitoring of the process of the separations within the channel, which will aidin improving our understanding of chromatographic separations. We have beenusing electrochemical detection for in-channel detection as it has excellentlimits of detection (∼10−15 mol dm−3) compared tospectroscopic methods which scale linearly with path length.
An array of gold wires is embedded on polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) wafer (Hanyang University, South Korea),and 8 pairs of the printed gold wires served as the in-channel electrochemicalmicroelectrodes. A 500 μm width and 3 cm long polyester microchannel is bondedperpendicularly on top of the PET wafer across the gold wires. The channel willbe packed with silica-based stationary phase. Studies of the packed andunpacked channel will be carried out, and the process of the separation will bemonitored using in-channel electrochemical detection.
Hydrogen peroxide is one of form reactive oxygen specieshighly toxic to cells. It causes oxidative stress and is a marker of many kindsof pathological situations. Ascorbic acid is important as an antioxidant. Inthis work, a film made using a layer-by-layer method was assembled using hemoglobin andpoly[4-vinylpyridine Os(bipyridine)2Cl]-co-ethylamine (POs-EA). The hybrid filmwill be used to simultaneously determine concentration of ascorbic acid andhydrogen peroxide. The film formation will be ascertained by theelectrochemistry, the quartz crystal microbalance, and other spectroscopicmethods. Determination of hydrogen peroxide using this sensor does notinterfere with determination of ascorbic acid. A linear dependence of peakcurrent was obtained for both ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The resultsof limit of detection of this sensor for both two analytes will be presented.
Insulin is stored in the secretory granules of beta cells inpancreatic islets, where it is cocrystallized with zinc ions in a 6:2 ratio(insulin:Zn2+) (see Figure 1). Upon secretion from normal islets, insulin and zincions are released into the extracellular space in this 6:2 ratio. In order toimage real-time insulin and zinc secretions from islets, droplet microfluidicsis utilized to collect secretions with minimal dilution. Through a novelapproach, combining lock-in spatial filtering and droplet fluidics, highlysensitive measurements are made via confocal fluorescence microscopy. Using acompetitive zinc-binding assay between EDTA and the fluorescent zinc indicator,FluoZin-3, this approach results in sensitive and quantitative real-timeimaging of zinc as it is secreted from live pancreatic islets duringglucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Furthermore, time traces ofdroplet-confined secretions can be stored in tubes, and can later be used toquantify insulin using radioimmunoassays (RIAs) or enzyme-linked immunosorbentassays (ELISAs). We are utilizing these methods to investigate insulin storagedefects that occur in diabetic mice, particularly those with mutations of the SLC30A8 gene which encodes for the zinc transporter ZnT-8 that is present exclusivelyin secretory vesicles of pancreatic beta cells. Deletion of this gene leads toimpaired glucose-tolerance in knockout mouse models.
Differential flow-modulated GCxGC, as developed by Seeley,has been shown to provide a simple and robust alternative to thermallymodulated systems [4]. This paper will present a differential flow GCxGC systemwhere the modulator hardware has been integrated into a simple monolithicdevice using a new approach called capillary flow technology. Further, the keypneumatics hardware, electronics hardware, and software have been optimizedaround this modulator to provide a completely integrated system for easyoperation and method development. Test results will be presented along withsome key applications that will demonstrate system performance.
The rapid introduction of ultra-high performance LC (UHPLC)columns containing particles that are smaller than 3 μm has created very narrowpeak widths that can no longer be faithfully measured by all HPLC instruments.In addition, Fused-Core particles have become available, which can deliver peakwidths comparable to sub-2 μm particles with flow resistance comparable to 3 μmparticles. Their moderate operating pressure allows UHPLC performance to beachieved with older and traditional instruments which demonstrate adequatelylow instrument dispersion or bandwidth; however, users need a simple way toqualify HPLC instruments, rather than by pressure rating, for use with UHPLCcolumns.
In this paper, origins of peak dispersion or bandspreadingwill be examined in detail, including (1) dispersion within the column particlebed, (2) dispersion from column elements such as fittings and frits, and (3)extra-column dispersion from HPLC instrument volume elements such as injector,precolumn tubing, postcolumn tubing, and detector flow cell. Additional systemoperating elements that can increase sample bandspreading such as excessivesample injection size, nonuniform column temperature, and slow detectorresponse time will also be covered. Rapid techniques for measuring HPLCinstrument dispersion will be described with the objective of establishingbandwidth data for every HPLC instrument in the laboratory. Practicalsuggestions for improving bandwidth of older instruments will be offered, and anew high-performance fitting will be described. Performance of bothconventional (400 bar) and UHPLC instruments (600–1000 bar) will be compared,and preferred terms for description of chromatographic dispersion will berecommended. Examples of both high-speed and high-resolution UHPLC applicationswill be included.
NIR chemical imaging is recognized as an importantanalytical tool for a wide variety of industries, including agriculture,medicine, chemical, and pharmaceutical development and production. ConventionalNIR imaging technologies utilize filtering or dispersion of a broadband lightsource in order to achieve wavelength selection, which imposes several keyperformance limitations.
We present a spectral imaging instrument based on tunablelaser technology. Specifically, we utilize an optical parametric oscillator(OPO), which can provide high output power and narrow bandwidth over a broadrange of wavelengths. By replacing the broadband source and tunable filters ofa typical NIR imaging instrument, several advantages are realized, includinglarge field of view, fast scan rates, and the ability to use optical fiber forefficient and flexible delivery of light to the sample. Because of theseadvantages, the instrument only requires a few seconds to acquirehigh-resolution, calibrated, and hyperspectral data over the NIR range. Actualwavelengths are recorded and the reflectance signal is calibrated and correctedfor linearity at each wavelength in real time, without the need for a premeasurementcalibration.
Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) is now widely used inthe environmental, food, and polymer analysis areas to increase the efficiencyof the sample preparation process. Using ASE, sample preparation times can be shortened,and the required amount of extraction solvents is dramatically reduced. While savingof time and solvent is always favorable, the ability to rapidly andquantifiably extract contaminants from a variety of matrices is very importantas well. ASE methodology is specified in environmental methods such as USEPAMethod 3545A as part of the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP SOW OLM04.2). ASEmethodology is also specified in methods in Germany (German Method L00.00-34) and China (Chinese Method GB/T 19649-2005), as well as ASTM standard practice D 7210.
ASE can be used to automatically extract samples withoutuser intervention. Recent advances in the use of adsorbents in the extractioncell have enhanced the capability of this technique. For example, adsorbentshave been used to retain a wide variety of interfering species includinglipids, ionic compounds, and colored compounds such as chlorophyll and others.Sequential extractions with solvents of varying polarity can also achieveselective extractions and fractionations. For example, samples can be extractedwith nonpolar solvents first to remove nonpolar interferences prior to theextraction of polar analytes.
This paper will discuss the use of adsorbents in theextraction cell to automatically produce extracts that can be analyzed withoutadditional sample pretreatment. Automatic sequential extraction of samples toproduce unique fractionation and selectivity in ASE will also be presented.
Anthocyanins and betalains are water soluble vacuolarpigments. In flowers, anthocyanin and betalain pigments function as pollinatorattractants, and in fruits, the colorful skins attract animals which will eatthe fruits and disperse the seeds. In photosynthetic tissues (such as plantleaves or the stems of cacti), anthocyanins and betalains have been shown toact as a “sunscreen” protecting cells against photodamage byabsorbing UV and blue-green light, thereby protecting the tissues fromphotoinhibition or high light stress. They are synthesized exclusively byorganisms of the plant kingdom, and have been observed to occur in all tissuesof higher plants, providing color in leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits.While the majority of land plants contain anthocyanins, there are a fewexamples of plants producing betacyanins as in the Caryophyllaceae, Cactaceae,and Rubiaceae families. This work began as the characterization of betalainpigments from Beehive cactus (Mammillaria vivapara var. vivapara)flower petals by LC/ESI/MS-MS. In addition to the expected betalains, several anthocyaninswere unexpectedly identified in the flower petals. The identification of theseanthocyanins in Mammillaria vivapara var. vivapara is a novel discoveryin the species. Additional work has since then been carried out on 20 differentcacti flower petals encompassing five genera of cacti, all of which have beenfound to contain anthocyanins. Approximately 40 different anthocyanins havebeen identified in the extracts of cacti flower petals at this stage of thework. Comparisons to anthocyanin standards obtained, from plants known tocontain anthocyanins, have resulted in the identification of 15 of thesepigments to this point.
In this paper, we have developed a new amino acid analysismethod based on HPLC and precolumn derivatization. The method is simple,reliable, and cost-effective. It can be done on regular HPLC/UV 254 and thereis no need to use expensive amino acid analyzer. The method uses PITC(phenylisothiocyanate) for amino acid derivatization and UV detection. Byoptimizing the operational conditions and instrument parameters, we are able toget good reproducibility and comparable results to other commercializedmethods. It features the following advantages: low cost for instruments andreagents; analyzing all primary and secondary AA simultaneously; quickturnover. Many examples of applications in food and pharmaceuticals will bepresented.
To provide an automated solution to the liquid-liquidextraction process for downstream applications, Aurora Biomed Inc. hasvalidated its liquid-liquid extraction workstation. In this validation, thewater-alcohol (1:1) samples were spiked with β-carotene at 850 μg/mL. Thesample (liquid phase) and the hexane solvent (organic phase) were mixed eitherby autoshaker provided on the deck of the workstation or by auto-pipet-actionof the workstation. The extraction profile showed that 90.1 and 9.3% of theactive compound were extracted in the first and second extractions,respectively. The third, fourth, and fifth extractions had 0.3, 0.1, and 0.02%efficiency, respectively. The mixing of the sample and the solvent was effectivelycarried by the autoshaker at 1100 rpm. The performance of the shaker at 700 rpmwas also compared with 1100 rpm. The latter speed was observed to be moreeffective than the former. The extraction profile of the automated operation inthe manual performance was found to be better than manual performance.
The gas detector array GDA2 was developed for the fastidentification of toxic industrial chemicals and chemical warfare agents. Thedetector array consists of a combination of an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS),a photoionization detector, two metal oxide sensors, and an electrochemicalcell.
Due to low temperatures in the IMS, some of the militaryused explosives cannot be detected.
This is because some explosives have almost no vaporpressure and require special sampling methods and higher operating temperaturesin the detector. Many explosives are based on nitrogen-oxide compounds, whichcan be detected in the negative mode of the IMS. New peroxide-based explosives,now often used in terrorist attacks because of their simple manufacture, have amuch higher vapor pressure and cannot be detected in the negative mode of theIMS.
Sampling methods and modifications needed for thesimultaneous detection of all kinds of explosives will be discussed. Theidentification and warning capabilities of the system, compared to an ionmobility spectrometer, will be shown.
Denitrification of wastewater on Cape Cod is an important process because of the nitrogen problems inthis area. As a result, there are a number of denitrification systems in useand are being tested at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod.
The continuous measurement of nitrogen compounds inwastewater is important in determining the long-term effectiveness of controltechniques. It is difficult to judge the long-term performance of any systemwith only grab samples (weekly/biweekly). The continuous systems will send asignal wirelessly to a PC in a nearby trailer that is connected to theinternet. The data will be available to Suffolk University, the Town of Barnstable, and the vendor of the wastewater system. The advantageof the wireless system is that built-in diagnostics (calibration, pump, etc.)will improve the uptime as well as the quality and quantity of the data. Wewill be adding MODBUS (bidirectional RS232) communications to the analyzer tofurther enhance the diagnostics. If MODBUS was added to the control system,remote tuning of the control system would be possible.
The analyzer will be a PID Model 610 that uses ion-selectiveelectrodes for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. Each of the sensors will have aseparate pump for the addition of ionic strength adjustment buffers prior tothe measurement. A single meter will be used to display the results and convertthe output to a linear voltage proportional to concentration. Samples ofwastewater (24-hour integrated) will be collected daily and run by standardmethods at the Barnstable County water labs. Wewill compare the 24-hour integrated sample results with the results from thecontinuous analyzers, and determine the effectiveness of these electrochemicaltechniques for continuous monitoring of wastewater.
Biomass is organic material made from plants and animals.Some examples of biomass fuels are crops, manure, garbage, and the most commonwood. In the past, wood was burned for heating and cooking and was the main sourceof energy.
Many manufacturing plants in the wood and paper products'industry use wood waste to produce their own steam and electricity. This savesthese companies' money because they do not have to dispose of their wasteproducts or buy as much electricity.
To calculate the energetic value of the wood, it isnecessary to know the elemental composition. Therefore, the use of exactanalytical techniques, better still if they are automatic, is required. TheFlashEA 1112 CHNS/O Analyzer permits the quantitative determination of carbon,nitrogen, hydrogen, sulphur, and oxygen, and the dedicated software Eager 300allows automatic gross and net heat value calculation. The system, which isbased on the dynamic combustion of the sample, provides simultaneous CHNSdetermination in a single run and the Oxygen determination by pyrolysis in asecond run. To perform sulfur determination at trace levels, the analyzer hasbeen coupled with the flame photometric detector (FPD). The method combines theadvantages of the elemental analyzer with the sensitivity, selectivity, androbustness of FPD. The coupling is simple, and it allows for the sulfurdetermination without matrix interference.
This paper presents CHNS/O data of wood samples to showrepeatability obtained with the system and the calorific values automaticallycalculated by Eager 300 software.
Hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in drinking areof particularly high interest all over the world and are regulated in manycountries. Although the P&T-GC/MS has been used to determine VOCs, higher-sensitivityand sample throughput methods are still required. The scan/SIM (selected ionmonitoring) measurement can acquire both datasets at the same run by alternateswitching. It can also perform precise quantitative analysis for targetcompounds with lower sensitivity using acquired SIM data and confirmed targetcompounds using mass spectra from acquired scan data. In this study, the applicabilityof the scan/SIM using P&T-GC/MS was investigated for the EPA method 8260Canalysis to improve the sensitivity.
The Eclipse 4660 purge and trap sample concentrator (O•I•Analytical) aswell as GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Corporation) equipped with a shorter capillarycolumn (Rtx-624, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., df = 1.40 μm) were used. The columntemperature program started at35 for 0.5 minute and was increased to 220 at 20/min and held for 2.75 minutes. 
The high-speed column temperature program of GCMS-QP2010Sallowed that the total time for analysis is shortened without loss ofseparation efficiency, and three samples were analyzed in one hour. The S/Nvalues of these compounds in scan/SIM were enhanced by a factor ranging from3.7 to 10.7 times higher compared with the S/N values in scan. Thereproducibilities of all compounds at 0.2 μg/L (n = 7) using scan/SIM were lessthan 8% in the relative standard deviation, and improved approximately by one halfcompared with the reproducibilities using scan. The calibration curves of allcompounds in scan/SIM showed the linearity that ranged from 0.1 μg/L to 200 μg/L,and the dynamic range in scan/SIM was twice as wide as the dynamic range inscan.
The scan/SIM measurement improved the sensitivity fortwenty-six VOCs, and mass spectra could be used for the confirmation of targetcompounds.
Perchlorate inhibits uptake of iodide into the thyroid glandleading to irregular production of thyroid hormone and giving rise todevelopmental problems, neurological disorders, reduced intelligence, andcerebral palsy. Human exposure to perchlorate has not been quantified, andcurrent environmental exposures are unknown. Perchlorate is wide spread as aresult of both natural and anthropogenic sources, and has been detected indrinking water, food, and both human and cow milk. Sensitive and selectivemethods for in-field monitoring would aid in mitigating exposure as well astracing remediation efforts. Currently, the EPA has set reporting limits at 4 ppb. The most common methods for perchlorate detection are ion chromatographycoupled to conductivity detection, and liquid chromatography coupled to massspectrometry. While these methods are very capable, their size, complexity, andcost limit the use to well-equipped and well-funded laboratories. Inexpensiveand compact analyzers are needed that are capable of field measurements. Herewe present a simple, rapid, and inexpensive system for monitoring perchloratelevels in water samples using microchip capillary electrophoresis withconductivity detection. Microchip devices enjoy low-cost fabrication andinstrumentation as well as portability. Sub-ppb detection limits will be shownas well as separation of perchlorate from other water contaminants. Furthermore,separation occurs in 65 seconds, providing near real-time perchloratemeasurements. Samples can be run without pretreatment, aside from filtrationfor turbid waters. In-field monitoring systems will also be presented that arecapable of drawing samples directly from the surface water and analyzing them onsite (see Figure 2).
Due to their toxicity and persistence in the environment,volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are particularly important pollutants. Someof them are mutagens, teratogens, or carcinogens. For this reason, governmentagencies require these contaminants to be monitored at progressively lowerlevels. The qualitative confirmation, quantitative accuracy, and precisionrequired in current regulations demand high-performing analytical solutions.
As static headspace technique does not allow for all thecompounds the attainment of the minimum detectable levels required by law inforce (EPA 8260/524 and Italian D.M. 471/1999 and D.L.31/2001), dynamicheadspace sampling is the preferable technique as it permits to reach the requiredsensitivity.
In this paper, the use of a dynamic headspace samplercoupled to a capillary GC for the determination of VOCs in water is presented.
The water sample, put in a standard 20 mL vial, is placed ina dynamic headspace sampler that automatically performs all the followingoperations. The sample, eventually heated, is first purged with a flow of inertgas for a defined time; the inert gas sweeps the sample and carries out thevolatile compounds; the purged gas, enriched in VOCs and water, passes througha cold focusing trap where the compounds are concentrated. Finally, the trap isheated up in backflush, the desorbed gas passes through the “DewStop”—a deviceespecially designed to remove humidity before entering into the GC or GC/MSsystem.
Data will be reported including chromatographic parameters,method detection limits, calibrations, and efficiency of the humidity removalsystem.
Therapeutic drug monitoring may be routinely done if thestandards of both the parent drug and its metabolites are available foranalysis. Selective detection highly facilitates evaluation of metabolism.Either mass-selective mode of RPC-MS or another specific and sensitivemonitoring may be used. Scouting for the tentative metabolites is a rathercomplicated case.
Bis-pyridinium aldoxime types of cholinesterase reactivatorsare extremely hydrophilic compounds. Microsomal treatment of pyridiniumaldoximes is the major method of choice for in vitro metabolism. Both thelipophilicity and the retention characteristics of metabolites are generallydecreased during the metabolic processes. A series of experiments were devotedto model separation of their metabolites from the chromatographic peaks of thebackground (blank) microsome.
Both RP-8 and RP-18 stationary phases and either one ofmethanol, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofurane mobil phase can give adequateseparations of chromatographic peaks to identify the generated metabolitesusing their mass spectra. The chromatographic separation is generally improvedby the use of ion-pairing agents such as trifluoroacetic acid. Monitoring ofseparation was done at 286 nm (ultraviolet detection of HPLC separation).RPC-MS analyses are evaluated using parallel detection at 286 nm, total ioncurrent (TIC), and characteristic single ion monitoring (SIM). In vitro metabolic studies suggest metabolismof bis-pyridinium aldoximes with oxidation such as either aliphatichydroxylation or aliphatic epoxidation depending on the length of the sidechain.
This project was financially supported by the grant of OTKAT049492.
Even with MS or MS/MS, chemists still have problems withsome very complex sample matrices. As examples, the analysis of toxic compoundsfrom plastic toys or fibers is still hard to avoid the matrix effects, evenusing MS. GPC has been used for food sample cleanup for many years, but it isnot online and is very time-consuming. In this study, we explored 2D HPLC inminimizing the matrix effects. In particular, we developed a scheme using acombination of HILIC columns and RP, to perform continuous separation. As forGPC/LC and GPC/GC combination, we developed a general method to get online cleanupfollowed by LC/MS or GC/MS analysis.
An automated collector of terrestrial system (ACTS) devicewas designed as an inexpensive method of sample collection, while reducinghuman error from adverse sampling conditions and fatigues. Field and laboratorytesting with greenhouse gases demonstrated the versatility and reliability ofthe programable ACTS device. Field testing took place at University ofNebraska-Lincoln East Campus, and treatments included drawing samples manuallyby a simple automated spring-loaded device and with the ACTS device. Resultsshowed strong correlation (r2 = 0.81–1.00) between sampling methods.Testing continues with various peripherals to further evaluate agroecosystemmanagement applications, such as soil respiration related to residue managementand methane emissions from livestock waste.
Tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLAS) is a rapidlygrowing approach in online process analysis. Combining highly specificabsorption laser wavelengths using a wavelength modulation spectroscopytechnique provides a high degree of selectivity and sensitivities below 1 ppmfor many small gas molecules in natural gas and other hydrocarbon streams.While the noncontact TDLAS approach does not typically require calibrationupdates, it is important to verify that the online system is performing properlyand that the results are valid. The new AMETEK 5100 NCM system for the analysisof moisture in natural gas uses a novel approach for performance validation.The system contains a sealed water reference cell which provides verificationthat the laser is “locked” on the selected water absorption line. Thewater reference cell is also used to perform a reliability check on thequantitative measurement of the water measured in the sample cell. This is doneby carefully measuring the temperature and pressure of the reference cell block,and then thermodynamic expressions are used to calculate the water vaporconcentration in the reference cell. If the calculated concentration for thewater in the reference cell based on the laser line absorption matches the theoreticalvalue, the performance of the system is said to be verified. If there is amismatch between the expected and calculated concentrations, an error isreported. The performance of this system for the analysis of moisture innatural gas between 5–2000 ppm will bedescribed.
A personal response system (PRS) is a form of technologythat offers the instructor the opportunity to ask in-class questions duringlecture, receive responses from every student, and obtain immediate feedback.It is generally used in freshman lectures. In recent years, it has been used ina junior-level analytical chemistry lecture to maximize the classroom learningenvironment. Advantages and disadvantages of the technology will be presentedand compared to learning in a traditional lecture.
The present paper will describe novel powerful imaging for X-rayfluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). So far, the scanning-typeimaging has been widely used in those techniques. Though recent progress inhigh-spatial-resolution imaging using synchrotrons is wonderful, there has beena clear limit; because of the step scan, the imaging requires a long measuringtime. In many scientific applications, X-ray imaging that is much more rapid (e.g.,capable of high-speed resolution rather than high-spatial resolution) can beextremely important. As shown in Figure 3, it is possible to do X-ray imaging without performingany scans. Here, the method uses a quite wide beam, which illuminates the wholesample surface in a low-angle-incidence arrangement (0.5 ∼ 3 deg). The detectorused is a CCD camera working at 30 fr./sec, equipped with a collimator inside,and the distance between the sample surface and the detector is set extremelyclose in order to enhance both spatial resolution and efficiency. Note that theimaging is done with one shot. In the case of XRF imaging, distinguishingelements are required and, therefore, most of the experiments were performedwith monochromatic or quasi-mono-chromatic X-rays. The procedure for XRDimaging uses a combination of exposure and incident X-ray energy scan (or justtuning). Since the present experiment employs a fixed small-angle incidence andalso a fixed diffraction angle of around 90 deg, the diffraction plane here isinclined at about 45 deg from the surface of the specimen. By scanning theenergy of the incident X-rays, one obtains a diffraction peak which correspondsto the lattice spacing. Further instrumental details and many applications willbe presented. 			
In an effort to keep pace with the speed of drug discoveryand development, bioanalytical laboratories are continually searching for newsample preparation and LC/MS/MS technologies to increase sample throughput. Aspart of drug discovery, LC/MS/MS methods are used for early PK screening, leadoptimization studies, and lead qualification bridging studies. Once a compoundis selected for development, more robust methods are developed and validated incompliance with GLP regulations to support several activities in drugdevelopment including formulation optimization, GLP toxicology studies, andclinical studies.
In this presentation, recent LC/MS/MS technologies that havebeen implemented in pharmaceutical laboratories to increase the speed andefficiency of quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis will be described. One approachthat has been used successfully is online sample preparation, such as theProspekt system in which disposable extraction columns are utilized for sample cleanup.Turbulent flow chromatography (TFC) has also been used for the onlineextraction of samples. The TFC column may serve as both the sample purificationand the analytical column. Serial introduction of multiple LC column effluentsinto a single mass spectrometer ion source can also provide high-throughputcapability, particularly in cases where the useful runtime is a fraction of thetotal analysis time.
Instrumentation advances that increase the efficiency andthroughput of a bioanalytical laboratory also include innovative mass analyzerdesigns. Although the conventional triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometerused at unit resolution in the SRM mode provides excellent sensitivity andselectivity for quantitative analysis, there are instances when interferencefrom matrix or metabolites may be reduced or eliminated using high-resolutioninstrumentation. This may be achieved using several types of mass spectrometersincluding a Q-TOF or an LTQ-Orbitrap.
Bioanalysis is a technique which is used for thequantitative determination of drugs and their metabolites in biologicalmatrices.
Hyphenated instrumentation, such as liquid chromatography ormass spectrometry (LC-MS), is an essential tool in pharmaceutical industries.Due to its high selectivity and sensitivity, it plays a crucial role for drugdiscovery and development.
One of the most important factors fordrug discovery and development, is the availability of high-throughput analyticalapproaches. The introduction and implementation of automated 96-well and even384-well extraction techniques have made the approaches more realistic. Theautomated extraction techniques can be protein precipitation, solid phaseextraction,and liquid-liquid extraction. Additional high-throughput techniques include onlineextraction, the application of pierceable caps for biological tubes, and the so-callednanostream technique which has recently been introduced into the pharmaceuticalindustries.
Combination of automated 96-well sample preparation with theapplication of liquid chromatography (especially, UPLC or fast HPLC) coupledwith tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) has enabled bioanalysts to face thehigh-throughput challenges with greater confidence.
High-throughput assay can be also improved by using aparallel mechanism. For example, multiple HPLC systems are connected to one MSsystem. A real-study comparison will be presented where two HPLCsystems are connected to one MS system.  Most recent advances in the bioanalyticalfield will also be reviewed in this presentation.
Several methods exist for the determination of nitrate inaqueous solutions; however, the most commonly performed automated colorimetricmethods utilize toxic substances and generate hazardous waste (hydrazine and cadmium).There is no hazardous waste generated when performing the method presented anddisposal costs are minimized or eliminated. The method has been specificallydeveloped for discrete analysis which enables it to truly run unattended, thusgreatly reducing labor and improving laboratory productivity.
The procedure for the determination of nitrate utilizes thereaction in which nitrate is reduced to nitrite by a proprietary reagent“R1.” The reaction is slow and requires more than 12 minutes for 100%reduction of nitrate to nitrite. The reduced nitrate is then treated with sulfanilamideand N-1-naptylethylenediamine dihydrochloride under acidic conditions to form ahighly colored soluble dye which is measured colorimetrically between 520–550 nm. The finalproduct measured represents the nitrite ion being originally present, plus thatformed from the reduction of nitrate (nitrate + nitrite). In order to determinethe true nitrate concentration, the sample must also be analyzed separately forNitrite to determine the amount originally present in the sample. The valueobtained for nitrite is then subtracted from the nitrate + nitrite value todetermine the true value for nitrate. Regardless of the sample matrix, recoveryof nitrate to nitrite is consistently between 95% and 105%, which is a dramaticimprovement over traditional automated colorimetric methods. After extensivetesting on various matrices, no matrix interference problems have beenobserved.
A mathematical model is presented to describe the effects ofconstant current on ion-selective membranes using theta functions. The modelprovides exact analytic solutions for calculating the concentrationpolarization of the ionophore, the ionophore-ion complex, and the chargedmobile sites in space and time within the membrane. It also predicts the timecourse of the membrane potential and the electric field inside the membranefollowing the application of constant current. This analytic solution is fasterto compute than the numerical simulations, and it provides the solution for anygiven time or position directly. The simulated concentration profiles comparedfavorably with concentration profiles recorded experimentally using spectroelectrochemicalmicroscopy (SpECM), and allowed the determination of the diffusion coefficientsof the ionophore, the ion-ionophore complex, and the charged mobile sitesinside an ion-selective membrane. The extension of the model to large-currentchronopotentiometry accurately predicts the experimentally recorded breakpointtime in the voltage-time transients. The diffusion coefficients calculated fromthe breakpoint times and from the initial ohmic resistance of the membranes arecompared to those calculated by fitting curves to the SpECM measurements.
Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) has been previously usedto study physiological preparations such as brain tissue slices. FSCV is apowerful technique since it exhibits chemical selectivity based on an analyte'ssignature oxidation and reduction potentials. Furthermore, FSCV at carbon-fibermicroelectrodes offers spatial and millisecond temporal resolution allowing forclose monitoring of catecholamine release dynamics. In this work, electricallystimulated catecholamine release in murine adrenal slices was studied usingFSCV. Our interest in adrenal slices stems from the neuronal origin of theadrenal chromaffin cells and their use as neuronal cell models. Upon electricalstimulation, chromaffin cells rapidly secrete the catecholamines' epinephrineand norepinephrine. Electrically stimulated catecholamine release was found tobe pulse-, frequency-, and calcium-dependent. Application of a sodium channelblocker (tetrodotoxin) was found to completely abolish release. In addition,the release profiles suggested an uptake mechanism. To characterize uptake,adrenal slices were incubated with varying concentrations of the uptakeinhibitor cocaine. Cocaine slowed the rate of uptake in a concentration-dependentmanner. Further studies revealed rapid spontaneous catecholamine release in anumber of slice preparations. In order to study spontaneous release,constant-potential amperometry (CPA) was employed due to its sub-milli-secondtemporal resolution. CPA revealed spontaneous events whose amperometric spike characteristicssuch as half width and area closely resemble those observed for vesicularrelease in isolated chromaffin cells. Spontaneous events were reversiblyblocked by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (hexamethonium)implying mediation of spontaneous release via nicotinic receptors. CPA datasuggests vesicular nature of spontaneous release in slices.

The vast majority of biological processes are carried out byintricate assemblies of proteins, working in unison to carry out functions notafforded by individual polypeptide chains. While the investigation ofquaternary protein structure has long been the domain of X-ray crystallographyand electron microscopy, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry hasrecently emerged as a powerful method for probing the structure of intactprotein complexes. A single stage of mass analysis reveals the molecular weightof the assembly and stoichiometry of the subunits, while tandem massspectrometry holds the potential to elucidate sub-oligo-meric structuralinformation through the dissociation of subunits from the intact complex.However, slow heating methods such as collision-induced dissociation (CID)invariably result in the asymmetric ejection of a single unfolded monomer fromthe complex and a complementary (n-1)-mer, limiting the amount of structuralinsight that can be gained.
We have recently implemented surface-induceddissociation (SID) within a Q-TOF mass spectrometer for the study of proteinassemblies. The sudden activation provided by SID results in a more symmetricproduct ion distribution and fragments other than monomer and (n-1)-mer,indicating that SID may yield additional information about the organization ofsubunits within a complex. Results are presented for SID of bacteriophage Croproteins, bovine insulin oligomers, and heat shock proteins from severalorganisms. These complexes demonstrate how the surface-induced dissociation ofprotein assemblies is affected by their molecular weight, subunit number,interfacial contact area, and subunit conformation (see Figure 4).
Acid secretion is utilized by the stomach to process food.This process is complex with a network of cells working simultaneously topromote acid secretion and cause muscular contraction or relaxation. One cellthat has been noted to play an influence on the parietal cells is enterochromaffin-like(ECL) cell. They directly activate hydrogen receptors at the parietal cells byreleasing histamine [5]. To date, there are no real-time direct measurementsthat can monitor histamine levels and pH changes, due to acid secretion,simultaneously. The ability to measure both will provide important mechanisticinformation on the cellular network of the stomach to gain better knowledge ofthe physiology of the stomach and understand how this mechanism changes duringdisease states' conditions.
To obtain spatial and temporal resolutions, we have utilizedtwo sensing devices. For the measurement of histamine, we utilized aboron-doped diamond (BDD) microelectrode with amperometric detection at 1.4 V versusAg|AgCl, which has been shown to be extremely stable for detection ofneurotransmitters in vitro [6]. For the measurement of pH, gold microelectrodeshave been developed as solid-state pH sensors based on anodic electrodepositediridium oxide film (AEIROF) [7].
The BDD microelectrode is characterized and calibrated forthe detection of histamine, showing good limits of detection. For pHmeasurements, calibration and stability data showed excellent sensitivityresponses with super-Nernstian behavior exceeding −70 mV/pH unit. Goodreproducibility with prolonged use has illustrated a reliable and robust pHsensor for biological applications. Some preliminary data obtained from tissuesamples will be shown.
Many of the EPA Series 8000 methods for the analysis oforganics in solid wastewater samples involve an extraction procedure. Solidphase extraction (SPE) has several clearly demonstrated advantages over thelabor intensive liquid-liquid extraction (LLE). Switching from LLE to SPEreduces the solvent consumption and labor required for the sample preparationstep. This directly impacts the profitability of the laboratory.
Automating the SPE process adds the additional benefits offurther reducing labor, the mostly costly component of the process, andimproving the reproducibility of the extraction. Consistency of the extractionprocess is enhanced, and operator-to-operator variability is eliminated withautomation. Automating the SPE process also minimizes the exposure to solvents.
This paper will focus on the benefits of using automated SPEfor 8000 Series wastewater samples. Data, showing precision, accuracy, andrecovery, from EPA Method 8270 will be presented. A cost analysis comparingmanual and automated techniques will be shown.
Oil and grease analysis using the new EPA method 1664Apresents new challenges for laboratories moving away from Freon113-basedliquid-liquid extractions. The “performance-based” method 1664utilizes n-hexane rather than Freon as the extraction solvent. Either liquid-liquid n-hexane extractions (LLE) or the less cumbersome solid phase extraction(SPE) can be used.
SPE reduces solvents and eliminates emulsions, andautomating SPE dramatically reduces labor costs. Performing manual SPEextractions is labor-intensive. Automation increases productivity, improvesconsistency, and provides a safe work environment when compared to thelabor-intensive manual SPE extractions. Automating the procedure allows theanalyst to accomplish multiple tasks while extractions are taking place.Multiple technicians can achieve higher precision due to the extraction consistency.Reducing direct contact with solvents creates a safe environment. With thenewly available 90 mm SPE disks, handling samples with high particulate are nolonger a problem.
The internal standardization technique is used to overcomematrix effects that might influence the analytical signal in the quantificationstep of the methods. It requires simultaneous or fast sequential analyticalmeasures, and it has therefore been widely used in methods employing ICP OESand ICP-MS. The use of the internal standardization technique in FAAS hasbecome feasible due to the introduction of a fast sequential system (FS) thatallows sequential multielement determination employing FAAS.
The present paper proposes use of the internalstandardization technique for correction of matrix effects in a procedure forthe direct determination of manganese and iron in wine and copper in fruitjuices employing FS-FAAS. The elements tested as internal standards werecobalt, silver, nickel, and indium. The results demonstrated that cobalt andindium are efficient for determination of manganese and iron in wine samples,respectively. For the quantification of copper in fruit juices, indium can alsobe used as internal standard. For analysis, the samples of wines and fruitjuices were acidified with 1 mol L−1 nitric acid solution.
The proposed method was applied for the determination ofmanganese and iron in sixteen wine samples and for quantification of copper inseveral fruit juices' samples. All analytical results were compared with theresults obtained by analysis of these samples after complete mineralizationusing acid digestion and determination using FAAS. 			
One of the most common applications of infrared and Ramanspectroscopies is to aid in the identification of unknown materials. While thetechnique works well when applied to pure compounds, results can be ambiguous when samples containing a mixture of compounds are analysed. Spectralsubtraction is a useful technique to help characterize mixtures bymathematically removing the spectral features of one or more of the suspectedconstituents. However, subtraction requires skill on the part of the analystand is limited due to the distortions it causes in the spectral data. Expandingthe use of infrared and Raman spectroscopies for identification of unknownmaterials demands that unskilled operators can effectively use the technique toobtain actionable results. Key components of the technology that are requiredfor this expansion are improved spectral searching algorithms and userinterfaces which allow operators to obtain results with a high degree ofconfidence.
In this presentation, insight will be provided into novelmulticomponent searching techniques and a unique operator interface used to aidin the identification of samples containing mixtures of chemical compounds.Specific examples will be provided for FTIR and Raman instrumentation inpolymer, forensic, and pharmaceutical applications.
In petroleum applications, it is often required to performthe analysis of several hundred hydrocarbon components in a single sample,presenting a very unique challenge for analytical problem solving. When thesecomponents are a mixture of various hydrocarbons with different carbon numbersand different degrees of saturation, the hope of separating them out in timethrough gas chromatography prior to detection is largely dampened, leaving theheavy burden of differentiating these components to the detection system alone.Fortunately, with the commercial availability of high-resolution massspectrometry such as time of flight (TOF) and its combination with softionization technique such as field ionization (FI), it is now possible todetect and differentiate hundreds of these hydrocarbons through massspectrometry (MS).
Even at the 10,000:1 resolving power of TOF MS, however,there exist spectral interferences that are located only a few mDa apart,rendering reliable analysis difficult. Combined with the frequent mass drift onTOF MS, it is unreliable to rely on accurate mass information for componentidentification. On the other hand, each of these petroleum components has itscharacteristic isotope distributions uniquely given by its elementalcomposition, which can be utilized to tackle both the interference and the massdrift problem as long as the TOF mass spectral peak shape function is known.This paper will describe a new approach to self-calibrate TOF MS in terms of bothaccurate mass and peak shape function, which will make it possible to take fulladvantage of the characteristic isotope distribution information for theelucidation of complex TOF MS data. In fact, a single-step solution involvingmore than 240 simultaneously unknown components can be obtained to achieve bothqualitative ID and quantitative analysis.
Characterizations of petrochemical streams are used to predictproperties and/or behavior in processes or during application. Although densitycan give indicative data about crude oil aromaticity [8], more information canbe obtained by a separation based on molecular properties of components in thesample. Nowadays, GC × GC [9] allows to obtain highly structured chromatograms ofpetrochemical samples based on separations along the distributions ofvolatility and polarity. However, GC × GC fails to give the systematicdistribution of aromatic and naphthenic classes. The addition of a previous LCstep has allowed a group-type separation of the sample into compound classeswith an equal number of aromatic rings [10].
In this work, a new application of the patented TOTADInterface for online coupling HPLC + HRGC is presented. The interface coupling anHPLC to an HRGC in the KONIK K2 HPLC + HRGC system allows the direct separationof petroleum fractions (aliphatic hydrocarbon; mono-, di-, and polyaromaticseries) without mixup between them before their analysis by GC-MS or GC ×GC-MS. The different hydrocarbon series were separated first by HPLC using anNH2 column and pentane, hexane, or heptane as mobile phases. Afterwards,hydrocarbons were eluted by groups from the column and the fraction of interestwas transferred to the GC-MS system. With the addition of the KONIK RobokromHPLC autosampler and the full control through the Konikrom Software, thecomplete analysis can be easily automated and performed in few minutes,limiting the use of solvents while protecting sample integrity.
In recent years, room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) haveproven to be of great interest to analytical chemists. One importantdevelopment is the use of RTILs as highly thermally stable GLC stationaryphases. To date, nearly all of the RTIL stationary phases have beennitrogen-based (ammonium, pyrrolidinium, imidazolium, etc.). In this work,eight new monocationic and three new dicationic phosphonium-based RTILs areused as GLC stationary phases. The solvation properties of the phosphoniumRTILs are studied using an inverse GC linear solvation energy model. This modeldescribes the multiple solvation interactions that the phosphonium RTILs canundergo, and is useful in understanding their properties. In addition, thephosphonium-based stationary phases are used to separate complex analytemixtures by GLC. Results show that the small differences in the solventproperties of the phosphonium ILs compared to those of the ammonium-based ILswill allow for different and unique separation selectivities. Also, thephosphonium based stationary phases tend to be more thermally stable thannitrogen-based ILs, which is an advantage in many GC applications.
In the incidents of chemical warfare terrorism, various kinds of toxic substances may be used, and on-site detection performed by first responders is required for countermeasure to minimize terrorism disaster. Ourprevious research on verification of commercialized on-site chemical warfaredetection equipments has disclosed that it is difficult to detect chemicalwarfare agent vapors perfectly for sensitivity, rapidity, and operation, and wehave newly developed field detection method for chemical warfare agents using themonitoring tape method. In this presentation, the monitoring tape method wasfurther improved for detecting cyanogen chloride (CK, blood agent), chlorpicrin(PS, choking agent), and sarin (GB, nerve gas). CK could be detected with limitof detection (LOD) of 0.2 mg/m3				 with sampling time of 30 seconds, using4-benzylpyridine and barbituric acid as coloring reagents. PS could be detectedwith LOD of 0.01 mg/m3with sampling time of 30 seconds, using transmission-typeapparatus with pyrolyzer (400°C) and 4-p-nitrobenzylpyridine as coloringreagent. GB could be detected with LOD of 0.5 mg/m3 with sampling time of 1 minute,using transmission-type apparatus as well as methyl yellow and methyl cellosolveas coloring reagents.
Drinking water is vulnerable to a variety of threats such astechnical imperfections of the water supply, accidents, or criminal attacks.Consequently, a fast and broadband detection system of water contaminations isof primary relevance. Since the threats are not confined to a certain part ofthe supplying network, highest security is only available if the water qualityis checked at the point of use. There, conventional water analytical laboratoryequipment is inappropriate because neither the costs or the size nor the laborinput is acceptable. New autonomously working low-cost monitoring systems arerequired to provide long-term stability and low size for system integration atpoint of use. To fit these requirements, a novel broadband water analyticalsystem is developed. Volatile components of the water are extracted online by agas-permeable membrane, and transferred to an electronic nose microsystem. Thelatter is based on a gradient gas sensor microarray sensitive to all volatilesexcept inert gases. Highly inexpensive fabrication is achieved using a singleSnO2 layer only subdivided by parallel electrode strips to form 38 conductivegas sensor segments. A temperature gradient and an inhomogeneous gas-permeablecoating differentiate the segment's properties providing gas characteristicconductivity patterns with which the volatile analysis is working. Nonvolatilewater components are detected optically with a minispectrometer analyzing lightabsorption as well as stray light or fluorescence. Not only can simplechemicals be detected by this combined technique but also particulate materialand even biological contaminations like bacteria via stray light and metabolismproducts.
Biosensors based on DNA hybridization have been used invarious studies for many years. However, biosensors based on molecular beacons(MBs) have not fully realized their potential. In biosensors utilizing MBs, theprobes are immobilized on a surface after which a complementary target is addedover the immobilized probe. The complementary sequence can then bind to the MBforming a hybrid on the surface. This allows the fast, sensitive, and selectivedetection of nucleic acid targets. However, MBs showed a relatively lowfluorescence enhancement when immobilized onto a surface compared to that insolution. One of the concerns when using MBs for immobilization is the factthat the hairpin structure may interact with the surface, degrading itpartially. These interactions can change the electrostatic properties and localenvironment of the immobilized MB. Consequently, once the structure of thebeacon is compromised, low quenching efficiency and therefore high backgroundare observed. In order to overcome these concerns, MBs using lock nucleic acids'bases (LNA) have been designed for immobilization onto a glass surface. Theexcellent affinity and stability that LNA offers combined with the detectioncapabilities of the MBs promise an outstanding tool for hybridization studiesonto surface. Also, these properties will allow for better immobilization efficiency,with a relative low-background signal and high stability of the immobilizedbeacon.
A Gilson parallel analytical chiral systemoptimizes chiral separations in a fraction of the time compared to conventionalchiral screening. The system screens chiral compounds on four separate chiralcolumns simultaneously, increasing throughput by 300%. Four analytical separations with chiral detectionin 15 minutes versus more than 60 minutes for a chiral analysis in series.The liquid handler automatically dilutes each sample to a specified concentration.Various solvents can be accessed for the dilution through a syringeless solventdelivery system, and solubilized via an orbital shaker. The liquid handlersimultaneously introduces the sample to four parallel chiral columns. Eachseparation is monitored by UV/Vis and chiral detection. The system is capableof gradient and isocratic mobile phase and mobile phase solvent selection. Onlyone chiral detector is required for the system, drastically reducing capitalinvestment. The system also monitors flow rate changes for each column throughpressure sensors. The systems' flow rate and sample are split in four ways by amanifold prior to the columns. After the sample has been chromatographed, theflow rate is combined into a single stream by a second manifold prior to thechiral detector, allowing for determination of optical rotation of theseparated peaks. Automatic overlays of the four UV traces relative to theoptical detector predict the best conditions for the separation based on typeof chiral column performance, mobile phase composition, and optical rotationwithin a single chromatographic run. Both gradient and isocratic profiles wereextremely reproducible. The system was designed to maintain the entireness ofthe separation through the parallel columns and into the chiral detector, whichis accomplished by minimizing tubing lengths and IDs to be equal throughout theentire system. The results from the analytical chiral scout chromatographicanalysis can then be implemented in preparative purification (see Figure 5).

A simple indirect UV photometric capillary electrophoresismethod was developed and has been validated for determining N-methylpyrrolidinein cefepime for injection. The electrophoric system consists of 5 mmolbackground electrolyte of imidazole adjusted to pH 5.1 with 3 M acetic acidsolution. The applied voltage was 20 kV and temperature was 20°C. The runtimefor the analysis was 8 minutes. Precondition was employed with 4 bar pressureat the inlet of the capillary for 3 minutes. A bare fused silica extended lightpath capillary with effective length of 56 cm and internal diameter of 50 μm was used. Theindirect UV detection was performed at wavelength, signal at 240 nm, andreference signal at 210 nm. A very good base line was achieved. The method isvalidated for linearity, specificity, limit of quantification, limit ofdetection, repeatability, robustness, and accuracy. A limit of detection andlimit of quantification were derived from the residual standard deviationmethod, the values were found to be 5.8 μg/mL and 16.3 μg/mL, and the relative standard deviation of10.9% and 5.2% was observed, respectively. The recovery was estimated to bebetween 98.1% and 103.2%. The overall recovery was 100.4%, and the relativestandard deviation was 1.8%.
This method requires less time consuming, simple samplepreparation, high buffering capacity, no extraction procedure as described inthe reported GC method, and very good base line as compared to the reported CEmethod.
The results of the various validation experimentsdemonstrate that the method is specific, linear, sensitive, repeatable, andaccurate. It is suitable for routine analysis of N-methylpyrrolidine incefepime for injection.

Surfactant deficiency and dysfunction have been associatedwith numerous pulmonary conditions. In premature newborns, surfactant deficiencyis the primary pathophysiologic mechanism of the neonatal respiratory distresssyndrome (RDS). Exogenous surfactants comprised of phospholipids and proteinsfrom animal sources are currently used to treat RDS. Lucinactant (Surfaxin;Discovery Labs, Pa, USA),a precision-engineered surfactant that contains a synthetic peptide in place ofanimal-derived proteins, has been developed.
Various approaches have confirmed the fundamental roles ofthe peptides and phospholipids in the surfactant system. Currently, industrypublications suggest that combined analysis of proteins and lipids is notrecommended based upon their inherent structural characteristics. Lucinactant contains four activeingredients: the peptide Sinapultide (also known as KL4) and three lipidingredients including two phospholipids, Dipalmitoylphosphatidyl Choline (DPPC)and Palmitoyloleylphosphatidy Glycerol (POPG), and the fatty acid Palmitic Acid(PA). In lucinactant, the four active ingredients form liposomal-likeaggregates in a trishydroxymethylaminoethane (Tris) buffer medium.
Presented here is a gradient HPLC-CAD (charged aerosol detection)method capable of resolving the peptide KL4 and the phospholipids DPPC, POPG,and PA with their corresponding lipid-related degradants in <35 minutes ona C18 reversed-phase column. The method is sensitive (LOD ~0.47 μg/mL), showsgood linearity (R2 > 0.99 for actives; R2 > 0.98 for impurities), and canreadily measure the low levels of the degradants (23.31 μg on column).
The chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy makes it anideal technique to noninvasively characterise an extensive variety of sampletypes. Recent developments utilising the diffusion of photons through turbidmedia (spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) [11] and transmission Raman(TR) spectroscopy [12]) have overcome the inherent bias of conventional Ramanspectroscopy towards surface layers, and allowed the identification and chemicalcharacterization of subsurface layers. Potential application areas include thedetection of bone disease and breast cancer, online monitoring ofpharmaceutical production lines, and security screening (see Figure 6).
The complexity of multilayered or multicomponent systems canbe unravelled by a battery of techniques based on statistical analysis.Applications of such multivariate techniques (including principal component analysis(PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and spectral deconvolution) will bedemonstrated in a number of areas including quantitative analysis of thecomposition of drug tablets and capsules, detection of explosives and illicitmaterials concealed in common containers, and the determination of the spectrumof bone measured through an overlayer of organic material.
An instrumental strategy for measuring methyl mercury inblood and urine samples is presented. The instrumentation is based ongaschromatography with a new dynamic headspace sampler (DHS) which allows theuse of individual traps for each sample coupled to a selective plasma emissiondetector (PED) with a robust and simple microwave-induced helium plasma source.
Method performance parameters and results for real samplesare presented. Reference measurements were done according to a standardizedmethod published by the German Research Foundation [13]. It is based onderivatizing methyl mercury with sodium tetraethylborate and on determining themercury species with headspace-GC/MS.
Dynamic headspace sampling methods instead of staticheadspace methods promise to result in exhaustive enrichment of the analyte.This provides on one hand lower detection limits. On the other hand, exhaustivemethods are independent of steady equilibrium partitioning of analytes betweensample and gas phases for different samples. This is important for urinesamples which can vary concerning their composition. For this study, a recentlydeveloped DHS system with replaceable adsorbent traps was used. The cleanadsorbent traps are stored in a sealed tray on the x-y-z robotic sampler whichtransports them to the sample vessel, then directly to the integrated thermaldesorber. This design enables automated optimization of trapping conditionsincluding choice of adsorbent, and avoids transferlines.
Detection was done with a recently developed robust and simple-to-useplasma emission detector (PED) for gas chromatography, based on an interferencefilter to select the emission wavelength of the mercury line at 253.65 nmexcited in microwave-induced helium plasma. Spectral background correction isperformed by oscillating the bandpass filter between two defined angels.
Profiling and anlysis of native and recombinantglycoproteins are crucial for many companies, but methods to perform thisimportant operation are often complex and require a great deal of expertise toperform. Here, we discuss profiling methods for N- and O-glycans that areideally suited for routine analysis utilizing an LCMS system equipped with aCorona CAD detector.
In these studies, N-linked glycans were released byN-glycanase or endo-H. O-glycans were chemically released either by reductiveB-elimination (RBE) or by nonreductive ammonia/ammonium carbonate (NAC). TwoHPLC stationary phases for separation of released oligosacchardies wereinvestigated. Both methodologies utilized charged aerosol detection (CAD), ahighly sensitive universal detection technique, for the routine analysis ofunlabeled glycans.
HPLC profiling of RBE-released O-glycan alditols wasaccomplished using a PGC column with CAD detection and simultaneous MS analysiswith flow splitting. In a typical experiment, approximately 300 μg ofglycoprotein are processed, and a volume equivalent to 25–50 μg is injectedfor HPLC using a 9:1 CAD:MS flow splitting ratio.
Released N-glycans were profiled on PGC as native structureswith CAD detection using a simplified sample workup only involving ultrafiltrationprior to HPLC. All expected oligosaccharide components were well resolved.Further sample workup via borohydride reduction gives a single peak forN-glycan alditols on PGC although a loss of sensitivity is evident. Retentionof heavily sialylated oligosaccharides is an advantage of PGC, allowing theprofiling of tri- and tetra-antennary glycans.
The concentrated buffer-free fractions obtainable using thisapproach allow unusual or low-abundance N-glycans and O-glycans to becharacterized offline by MS and the CAD with maximum sensitivity. Thisprofiling method is also amenable to further oligosaccharide structuralanalysis by MS.
The separation and identification of lipids in tissues intothree important biological classes (neutral lipids, fatty acids, andphosphatidylcholines) are promising as a tool for detection of certaindiseases. To date, separation attempted using manual SPE has had various problems,including inconsistent results between users and poor reproducibility ingeneral; that is, detection of diseased versus control tissues has beenaccomplished but with large scatter between test groups. A more reproduciblemethod has yet to be developed.
This study undertakes developing such an automatedreproducible SPE method for fractionating the lipids in biological tissue basedon a modified literature procedure. (Sorbent Extraction Technology Handbook). An automated SPEmethod using a Gilson GX-271 ASPEC was developed with a test solutioncontaining cholesterol, linoleic acid, and a phosphatidylcholine, which wereeluted with chloroform, 2% acetic acid in diethyl ether, and methanol,respectively. Breakthrough concentrations on amino SPE cartridges (Varian,BondElut, NH2, 3 mL, 50 mg) for these analytes were determined. Elution ofanalytes was confirmed with ESI-TOF-MS. This method was tested on extracts ofbiological samples. This automated approach yielded more reproducible data thanthe manual method.
The provision of clean uncontaminated drinking water is ofparamount importance to the water industry. In recent times, the requestedlimits of detection for pesticides have been decreasing as methodologiesimprove. Typically, water companies need to be able to perform quantificationbelow 1 μg/L. These low levels often mean that samples have to be extracted toconcentrate contaminants to such a level where they can be detected. Sample pretreatmentcan often be time-consuming and can add cost to the analysis.
Data presented were acquired on the 3200QTRAP LC/MS/MSsystem where pesticides have been detected at low ppt levels. High injectionvolumes were used with online solid phase extraction before LC/MS/MS analysis.Reproducibility was less than 15% at low ppt levels, and calibration over the range20–1000 ppt wasobserved to be linear. For confirmation, MRM triggered enhanced product ionscans with a collision energy spread to enhance the spectral quality.
Nitrate is one of the most universally determined anions innatural water and drinking water because it can promote eutrophication and itis toxic to fetuses, the young of livestock, and humans at concentrations thatexceed about 10 mg-N/L. In water, nitrate is usually determined by reduction tonitrite, which is subsequently determined colorimetrically with Griess reagents—acidicsulfanilamide (SAN) and N-(1-Naphthyl) ethylenediamine (NED). Longstandingreference methods such as EPA 353.2 and U.S. Geological Survey I-2545-90 usegranular cadmium in the form of small packed-bed reactors to reduce nitrate tonitrite. Widespread acceptance and application of cadmium-reduction nitratedetermination methods notwithstanding, “optimum” reactor geometry,activation procedures, and reagent formulations remain a topic of perennialdiscussion among environmental analytical chemists.
Ease-of-use, toxicity, and waste-disposal issues associatedwith cadmium-reduction nitrate determination methods led us to explore solublenontoxic reducing agents. Bispecific nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H:NaR; EnzymeCommission # 1.7.1.2, from Pichia angusta) and NADH:nitrate reductase(NADH:NaR; EC 1.7.1.1, formerly EC 1.6.6.1 produced by recombinant expressionof nitrate reductase from Arabidopsis thaliana in the yeast Pichiapastoris) are nontoxic and more selective than cadmium. This papersummarizes our considerable analytical experience with these enzymes, anddescribes automatic, semiautomatic, and manual approaches for using them asreplacements for cadmium in routine colorimetric nitrate determinations inwater.
Mercury is potentially used in chemicals and equipment suchas switches, gauges, thermometers, fluorescent and specialty lamps, and batteries.Because of the high toxicity of all mercury compounds, the extraction ofmercuric ions from aqueous wastes is of special environmental importance. Thesorption of selective metal ions by polymeric adsorbents has recently gainedmuch attention. Hg(II) has an extremely high affinity for thiol-containingcompounds and forms linear complexes. The coordination between Hg(II) and sulfathiazolewould be through the nthiazolic, with two hydroxyl groups bonding to Hg atom,in a local tetrahedral geometry [14].
In this study, a new mercury-selective monomer wassynthesized from the reaction between sulfathiazole and glycidyl methacrylate(GMA). Sulfathiazole-based hydrogel was prepared by irradiating the mixtures ofsulfathiazole-modified glycidyl methacrylate monomer, polyethylene glycoldiacrylate (cross-linker), and photoinitator by UV irradiation at ambienttemperature [15].
The optimization of procedure was performed undercompetitive and noncompetitive conditions using factorial design including pH,amount of hydrogel, contact time, temperature, ionic strength, and wet/dryhydrogel first and final concentrations of sample and eluent. Equilibriumisotherms were determined to assess the maximum sorption capacity of thesorbents. Elution of metal ions was investigated in acid media. It wasconcluded that the desorbed hydrogel could be reused to remove mercury without loss of adsorption capacity.
Peanut Company of Australia has been using nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for predicting quality of peanuts online since thebeginning of the year. We have been using the NIRS for prediction of moistureand oil contents, with predictions of fatty acids' contents, peroxide value,and free fatty acids' contents at final testing stages before implementation inthe online quality control.
Advantages of NIRS analysis online over conventionalchemical methods of analyses are as follows. It is nondestructive to samples;it is fast; it produces multiple results at once, allows analysis of each tonnepeanut bag, reduces cost of chemical testing (approximately 0.8 million AU$ peryear), and increases production efficiency; real-time decisions can be made.
Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography employs aninterface device (the modulator) between the first and second columns. Thethermal modulation uses hot and cold jets of gaseus nitrogen to continuouslyand efficiently trap and inject portions of eluting peaks from the primarycolumn into the secondary column.
The thermal processes are determined by the nitrogen coldflow and the temperature/time of the hot pulse. In order to obtain an optimalmodulation ratio of 3-4, the cold jet flow and the activity time of the hot jetpulse must change during the GC run for such application that requires thesimultaneous determination of either very volatile compounds or high-boilingcompounds. The optimized combination of these two parameters improves theefficiecy of the modulation in terms of preventing breakthrough of the high-volatilitycompounds and avoiding the trapping for semivolatile compounds, causingincreased contribution on the modulation ratio and peak tailing.
A microprocessor programable device is presented togetherwith some examples to control and optimize the thermal processes of acommercial dual-stage thermal loop modulator. It can be coupled with any GC'sbrand, and time-base programed to follow a GC run program. The cold nitrogenflow optimization and a specific programable function allow for an importantreduction of liquid nitrogen consumption in such type of modulators.
Static (equilibrium) headspace injection is commonly usedfor GC determination of volatiles in solid and liquid samples. Since thistechnique relies on the analyte partitioning between the sample and headspaceand uses a fixed injection volume, it may not provide adequate detectionlimits, particularly for higher molecular weight, and higher-boiling analytes.
In this study, we describe the use of a new automateddynamic headspace sampler for determination of volatiles in high water contentsolids and aqueous samples. This sampler uses a two-needle design to flush theheadspace of standard headspace vials onto replaceable adsorbent traps that canbe thermostatted to control interference from water vapor. After samplecollection, the adsorbent traps can be automatically dry-purged to furthereliminate trace water before introduction into the integrated thermal desorber.This design enables automated optimization of trapping conditions includingchoice of adsorbent, and has the potential for automated internal standardaddition and automated calibration.
Performance of the new system was compared to traditionalstatic headspace analysis using high water content solid samples like fruitsand vegetables, and also beverages. To illustrate the versatility of the newdesign, several sample types with high water content were tested with a seriesof adsorbent traps to choose optimal trapping conditions. Better detectionlimits were obtained with dynamic headspace for all sample types.
To provide an automated solution to the bottleneck problemof having high-quality genomic DNA for downstream applications, Aurora BiomedInc. has validated its nucleic acid isolation workstation. Using Promega'sMagneSil Blood Genomic kit, genomic DNA in 96-well format was isolated fromhuman embryonic kidney 293-cell line, Chinese hamster ovary cell line, humancheek buccal cells, and human saliva. The high molecular weight isolated DNAwas detected running close to 48.5 kb hyper-DNA ladder in ethedium detectionsystem. The fine DNA bands without any streaks indicated no shearing of the DNAmolecules in the automated process. The isolated DNA presented all panel genesfor which amplification was carried with specific primers. The automatedprocess was observed to be significantly efficient as no DNA was detected inthe wash and extra elution steps except the actual elution step. The isolatedDNA yield was 4.9 μg/500 μL of human saliva with an OD260/280 of 1.74–1.89.
The goal of much of the biotechnology industry is to preparelarge volumes of purified, native, or recombinant proteins. The purity of theproteins is vital for such applications. Since proteins vary from each other insize, shape, charge, hydrophobicity, solubility, and biological activity, thesedifferential characteristics make purification a very cumbersome process.However, the development of novel cloning vectors and affinity resins hascontributed significantly to the overexpression and purification of recombinantproteins in high quality and with ease. Aurora Biomed Inc. has developed aworkstation that employs Ni-NTA magnetic beads-based technology for thepurification of His-tagged recombinant proteins in high-throughput format. Thedata from the automated process would be presented in terms of purity,efficiency, throughput, and ease of purification of a recombinant protein.
Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid, andkill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They arewidely used in homes, gardens, and agriculture. Their mode of action isinhibition of cholinesterase enzymes, affecting nerve impulse transmission.Carbamate pesticides have caused more attentions because of their environmentaland human health impacts. It was reported that a large part of the carbamatepesticides went into the natural water system, leading to the intake of theseharmful substances by humans. Furthermore, these pesticides can be furtherdegraded into smaller and more hydrophilic molecules which can be even moretoxic to humans during the disinfection process in water treatment withdifferent oxidants in water treatment plants. Identification and monitoring ofthe formed degradation products, therefore, become crucial in providingcritical information for establishment of disinfection strategy in watertreatment plants. A comprehensive study was performed to identify thedegradation products of aldicarb in water at different treatment conditions,such as free chlorine, monochloroamine (MCA), chlorine dioxide, permanganate,ozone, and hydrogen peroxide. The main technique used was high-performanceliquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry. It was foundthat aldicarb sulfoxide was detected as a degradation product of aldicarb afterits treatment with free chlorine, MCA, ozone and hydrogen peroxide, andaldoxycarb was detected as a degradation product of aldicarb after itstreatment with permanganate. Aldicarb sulfoxide and aldoxycarb were furthertreated with these oxidants, and it was found that aldoxycarb was detected as adegradate of aldicarb sulfoxide after being treated with permanganate; no otherdegradates were detected when treated with other oxidants. N-chloro-aldoxycarbwas detected as a degradate of aldoxycarb when it was treated with freechlorine.
Fueled by demands for inexpensive instruments that providerapid real-time analytical results on-site (i.e., in-the-field, where neededthe most) and driven by developments in the micro-, nano-, andwireless-electronics industries, a powerful trend toward development ofportable analytical systems has emerged. Such mobile instruments will cause aparadigm shift in classical chemical analysis and metrology by allowing usersto carry (part of) the lab to the sample.
In this breadth rather than depth presentation and followinga brief overview of the field, two classes of examples from the authors'laboratory will be used as the means with which to illustrate the power ofmobile micro- and nanoinstruments.
One class involves a “patient” as the sample andan ingestible wireless capsule-size spectrograph for fluorescence-based cancerdiagnosis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tack as (part of) “the lab.”The other involves the “environment” as the sample and a couple ofmobile battery-operated instruments that are often fabricated on inexpensiveplastic substrates using soft-lithography or microfluidics channels [16] thatcan be used either for optical spectrometry or mass spectrometry [17] and thatutilize a palm-size personal organizer with a wireless interface for dataacquisition and signal processing as (part of) “the lab.”
To illustrate how to electrically power such instruments(and thus further enhance their portability), mobile energy issues will bebriefly addressed [18]. Particular emphasis will be paid to current andanticipated future applications, to the effect of scaling laws, to thescientific and technological roadblocks that remain to be overcome, and to theintegration of technologies that may prove essential in developing the nextgeneration of disruptive-technologies mobile micro- and nanoinstruments thatwill be fast, cheap, and under wireless control.
The development of portable mass spectrometers for fieldanalysis applications depends less on progress in the miniaturization of themass spectrometer analyzer components than on the reduction of the overallsystem utilities and vacuum requirements. In addition, approaches must be takento address the reduced ion capacity that accompanies miniaturization in orderto maintain system performance specifications that are comparable tolaboratory-based systems. Finally, the same requirements that driveminiaturization also drive an implicit requirement of reduced operatingcomplexity. In other words, use of mass spectrometers in the fieldwill likely be done by nonmass spectrometrists, and the operation and control of the systemmust accommodate this.
We have been developing a field-portable self-contained gaschromatograph-toroidal ion trap mass spectrometer (GC-TMS) system over the lastfew years. The current system, called GUARDION-7, is a ~12.5 kg package thatcontains everything needed for 4 hours of operation (battery power and gas) ina Pelican case that measures 47 cm × 35.7 cm × 17.6 cm. Analysis of gas orliquid samples is accomplished using a custom SPME sample injector, a fast (ca.3 minutes) chromatographic separation using a 5 m × 0.1 mm i.d. capillarycolumn coated with 5%-phenyl-95%-methyl polysiloxane stationary phase. The TMSoperates in the electron-impact mode over a mass range of ~50–500 da. Analysisturnaround time is under 5 minutes. Custom system operation software guides theuser through all of the data acquisition steps after power-up. Acquired spectracan be compared to on-board specialized libraries (i.e., chemical threatagents, toxic industrial chemicals) or to the NIST library.
Analytical performance has been tested on many classes ofchemical compounds, including environmental chemicals (both volatile andsemivolatile), explosives, drugs, chemical threat agents, and chemical agentsimulants. Performance measures (i.e., spectral integrity, detection limits,spectral mass resolution, and dynamic range) will be shown for many of theseapplication areas. Furthermore, the GUARDION-7 has undergone preliminaryenvironmental tests including temperature, electrostatic discharge (ESD), shakeand vibration, and drop testing with the goal of conforming to the MIL-STD 810Especification. In each of these areas, the instrument sustained only minorfailures. Examples of these results will also be presented.
Recent years have been marked by the emergence of newdisruptive physical, chemical, and biological innovations that are driven bythe vast scientific and technical capabilities provided by nanotechnology. Theessence of nanotechnology is the ability to engineer the individual buildingblocks of matter at the molecular level, atom by atom, to form a link betweenthe nanoscale and the micro- and even macroscales with precisely controlledfunctionality and customized properties/performance. Through the exploitationof intrinsic and engineered behaviors of such materials, unique biosensors canbe created. Integrating cells/tissues/biomolecules with computer chip platformsleverages both nature and state-of-the-art IC fabrication methods. The linkagebetween animate and inanimate components provides the key to expanding therange of possible experiments and resulting mobile sensors. Examples range fromthe use of innovative micro-/nanoscale chip developments for point-of-caredisease screening (TB, Botulism, etc.) to the creation of implantable multifunctionalprobes which can be used for documenting cancer cell metastatic dynamics.Recent results from a selection of ongoing bio-/nanotechnology researchprojects at the University at Albany's College of Nanoscale Science  and Engineering (CNSE)will be presented against a backdrop of the infrastructure development at CNSE.
In April 1982, I arrived in Pasadena to begin postdoctoral work withLeroy Hood at Caltech. I acquired a solid background in synthetic chemistry,fluorescence detection, and instrumentation development during my graduate workin the Chemistry Department at Stanford. However, I knew nothing about nucleicacids and the emerging field of molecular biology, and hoped to remedy thatshortcoming as a postdoctor. In short order, I found myself working long hoursat the tedious business of DNA sequencing. This gave me a great appreciation ofits laborious nature, and spurred my interest in attempting automation of theprocess. Over the course of some months, colleagues and I developed the basicidea of 4-dye fluorescence-based DNA sequencing, and I undertook the successivechallenges of developing a chemical means for tagging the DNA molecules,selecting a set of four appropriate spectrally resolved fluorophores, designingand building a prototype instrument, and obtaining the first proof-of-principledata demonstrating the concept. The work was published in Nature in 1986, andthe first commercial instrument was sold by Applied Biosystems in 1987. Overthe ensuing 20 years, very substantial investments by both the public andprivate sectors led to the evolution of these instruments into the powerfulworkhorses that we see today. These machines were the engine behind the successof the Human Genome Project and the concomitant transformation of biology into “informationscience” that we are undergoing today.
Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are suspected ofinterfering with the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife. They causeadverse health effects like cancer, behavioral changes, or reproductiveabnormalities in mammals, fish, and other species. Typical EDC compounds arecommon pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics. They are of special importancebecause their presence in the aquatic environment is also a potential cause forantibiotic resistance. The concentrations of these compounds in environmentalsamples are usually very low, that is, in the microgram/L scale (ppb to pptrange) which makes significant enrichment prior to a subsequent analysismandatory.
An instrumental online SPE-LC-MS solution for the analysisof selected antibiotics in aqueous matrices like river water or ground water ispresented. It comprises a sample cleanup and preconcentration procedurecombined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the separation,and mass spectrometry (MS) for detection with highest sensitivity andselectivity. The sample preparation step is performed using online solid phaseextraction (online SPE). The intended system is fully automated and operatedunder single-point software control. The high performance of the system isdemonstrated by analyzing a selection of representative antibiotics, mostly ofthe tetracycline and macrocyclic types.
A simple inexpensive method based on solid phase extraction(SPE) on sawdust from Cedrus deodara has been developed for the speciationof Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in environmental water samples. Because differentexchange capacities were observed for the two forms of chromium at different pH—Cr(III) was selectivelyretained at pH 3 to 4 whereas Cr(VI) was retained at pH 1—completeseparation of the two forms of chromium is possible. Retained species wereeluted with 2.5 mL 0.1 mol L−1 HCl and 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH.Detection limits of 0.05 and 0.04 μg mL−1 were achieved for Cr(III)and Cr(VI), respectively, with enrichment factors of 100 and 80. Recovery wasquantitative using 250 mL sample volume for Cr(III) and 200 mL for Cr(VI).Different kinetic and thermodynamic properties that affect sorption of the chromiumspecies on the sawdust were also determined. Metal ion concentration wasmeasured as the Cr(VI)-diphenylcarbazide complex by UV-visible spectroscopy.The method was successfully applied for speciation of chromium in environmentaland industrial water samples.
Biosensors based on antibody recognition have been used formonitoring biological targets for clinical, environmental, and homelandsecurity and food analysis. However, these devices suffer from poor limits of detectionfor some certain pathogens. We have developed antibody-modified magneticnanoparticles (MNPs) to improve their performance. The MNPs are iron oxides andare coated with silica. These particles were then conjugated with fluorescentlylabeled antibodies that were fluorescently labeled with Alex647. The antibody-conjugatedMNPs (Alex647-chick-MNP) were used in a direct immunoassay binding format, andthe assay was evaluated by measuring the Alex647-chick-MNPs bound to antichickIgG-modified slides. The Alex647-chick-MNP binding to the slides was optimizedby altering the nanoparticle composition, surface modification, andconcentration conditions. These prepared samples were evaluated using the NRLarray biosensor to monitor the immunoassay under flow conditions. This studydemonstrates the proof of concept and successful optimization of MNPs labeledwith fluorescent proteins used simultaneously for target concentration anddetection.
In this work, the development of a packed immobilized enzymereactor (IMER) and its integration to a capillary electrophoresis microchip aredescribed. The applied procedure involves the separation of the target analyteby capillary electrophoresis (CE), which is then coupled to a postcolumn IMERthat produces H2O2. The H2O2 produced is finally detected downstream at thesurface of a working electrode. Glucose was detected above 100 M by packingparticles modified with glucose oxidase at the end of the separation channel.The analytical performance of the microchip-CE was demonstrated by performingthe separation and detection of glucose and noradrenaline. Additions offructose showed no effect on either the peak position or the peak magnitude ofglucose. The microchip-CE-IMER was also used to quantify glucose in carbonatedbeverages with good agreement with other reports. The present microchip designdiffers from others in many aspects. First, the presented design allowsperforming analysis with or without the enzyme-coated particles. Second, thepresented microchip can detect different analytes just by changing the materialused to pack the IMER. By packing modified particles at the end of theseparation channel, the challenge of controlling the position and the size ofthe patch of immobilized enzymes is also avoided. Additionally, because of thelarger surface area of particles, larger amounts of enzyme can be immobilized.Furthermore, the use of packed IMERs allows the use of any substrate materialto fabricate the chip, and the enzyme is easily replaceable if activity islost.
This project was financially supported by The University ofTexas at San Antonio. L. Blanes and C. L. do Lago also thank FAPESP and CNPq for the scholarshipgranted.
Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful tool capable ofhigh-resolution separations of analytes from small volume samples. Due to thesmall diameters of capillary which are available and the high detectionsensitivity of laser-induced fluorescence detection systems, this technique iswell suited for single-cell analysis. However, in order to apply this tooltowards cellular analysis, several hurdles must be overcome. First, cells mustbe sampled in a manner which will not affect the signaling state of analytes inthe cell; second, analytes must be fluorescently labeled for detection.
We have assembled a CE system with laser-inducedfluorescence detection. This system has been coupled with a pulsed YVO4 nanosecond laser for rapid cell lysis (sub-milli-second). We have furthercharacterized the cell sampling efficiency of this technique with varying laserparameters using GFP-transfected cells. Optimal GFP sampling was obtained atlow laser pulse energies (P = .057, 2 μJ versus 9 μJ) focused directlyunder the cell (P = .055 versus 10 μm offset in the xy plane), resultingin a sampling efficiency of 0.67 ± 0.08. Fluorescent immunolabeling of targetproteins is currently being investigated as a labeling strategy. We arecurrently in the process of optimizing conditions for separations ofantibody-analyte complexes using several different capillary coatings includingacrylamide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and polybrene/poly(vinyl sulfonate) coatingsas well as various electrophoretic buffers. With high-resolution separation ofantibody and antibody-analyte complex, it will be possible to perform sensitiveanalysis of proteins in single cells.
The use of microfluidic systems for cellular studies hasbeen greatly advanced by the creation of devices for high throughput andparallel analyses. When compared to single-sample microchips for biologicalanalysis, parallel microfluidic systems greatly increase the speed at whichexperiments can be performed and datasets completed. A 15-sample microfluidicchip has been developed for continuous monitoring of hormone secretion fromlive cells using electrophoretic immunoassays. On the chip, perfusate frompancreatic islets is mixed online with immunoassay reagents. After ~2 minutesof reaction time, the reaction mixture is analyzed by capillary electrophoresiswith fluorescence detection. Parallel fluorescence detection (typicallyachieved with complicated laser scanning devices) was performed using astandard fluorescence microscope and CCD camera. The system has a 1 nM LOD for insulin. It can record 15 immunoassays every 10 seconds, and has an RSD ofconcentration determination of less than 1% for a single channel. Thesensitivity is sufficient to monitor insulin release with 10-second temporalresolution from 15 islets simultaneously. The chip produced reproducibleinsulin secretion plots, showing a basal secretion rate RSD of 9% between 15islets.
This microdevice has been tested on real-world samples byanalyzing insulin secretion from genetically modified islets. In theseexperiments, the 15-sample chip was used to examine the insulin secretionproperties of islets from mice lacking leptin receptors in the pancreas. It wasfound that the leptin receptor knockout mice had higher overall rates ofinsulin secretion than control islets, as well as no response from exposure toleptin (which was found to inhibit insulin secretion in control islets). Whileonly two experiments were required with the 15-sample chip in this study, 22would have been needed using a single-sample device. Additional experimentsexamined islet response to BSA and GLP-1.
A microfluidic device is being developed to analyze kinaseenzyme activity at the single-cell level to elucidate the role these enzymesplay in various intracellular signaling transduction pathways. Microfluidicdevices are well-suited to address single-cell assays because of their ability toprecisely manipulate the subpicoliter volume contained within a cell. The researchto date involves the development of a new microfluidic network capable ofrapidly trapping and lysing individual cells. The cells are pulled from a flowstream and trapped at the top of a separation channel using pressure in amodified patch-clamp technique. The trapped cell is then rapidly lysed using avoltage pulse which, when sufficiently high, causes permanent disruption of thecellular membrane. The cellular contents are electrophoretically injected intothe separation channel where separation and detection of the desiredintracellular compounds occur. To study kinase activity, membrane-permeablefluorescently labeled reporter peptides that are substrates for specific kinaseenzymes of interest have been developed. The resulting intracellular fluorescentlytagged substrate and product formed through kinase enzyme modification can beseparated and detected on-chip in less than six seconds, providing aqualitative assessment of the kinase activity within each cell. The rapid celllysis and separation capabilities of the device will allow for the analysis ofat least 10 cells per minute per separation channel. This provides at least a1000-fold increase in throughput as compared to the current technique forstudying single-cell kinase activity.
Today, spectrophotometric titrations are widely used byinorganic chemists to determine metal-ligand stoichiometries and formationconstants. Unfortunately, a laborious mix and measure approach are used almostuniversally with no attempt at continuous titrant addition. Experimentalcontrol, data acquisition, and data analysis are the hallmarks of methodautomation. For spectrophotometric titrations, the use of a modern instrumentwith a fiber optic probe and CCD array detector, together with addition of asyringe pump, solves most control and acquisition issues. Data analysisremains, but, as will be shown, there are a rich titration theory and softwaretechnology to draw upon. Developing algorithms and using multivariablecurve-fitting to extract information, therefore, become quite feasible.
Example studies used to illustrate the versatility of thisautomated approach were titrations of eriochrome black T with Mg2+, 1, 10-phenanthroline with Fe2+, and 1 and 10-phenanthroline with Cu2+. Algorithmsappropriate for each reaction were developed using the mathematical softwareMaple. Commercially available software was then used to fit algorithms totitration data and to assess the quality of their fit by means of apoint-by-point comparison of data(measured)—data(fit). Formationconstants obtained were in good agreement with literature values. Interestingdetails of stepwise reaction profiles were apparent in contours of theseautomated titration curves. For Cu2+, changing the roles of titrant andanalyte also reverses the order of the reaction steps. All in all, a lot waslearned from reactions occurring in small vessels taking only minutes toperform.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is an important biomarker for geneexpression analysis. MMP-7 and MMP-9 mRNAs are two extensively investigatedtargets, which have significant clinical value for early detection ofcolorectal cancers. In conventional approaches, low abundant mRNA molecules arereverse-transcribed followed by amplification through PCR (RT-PCR) to generateenough copy numbers for further interrogation. In this research, the time-consumingPCR step is eliminated, and the mRNA molecules are directly quantified using anallele-specific ligase detection reaction (LDR) via single-pair FRET assay. ThemRNA isolated from whole cells was captured in solid phase and reverse-transcribedinto its complementary DNA (cDNA). A pair of primers were designed that werebased on the sequence of the target cDNA strands, and were end-labeled with Cy5(donor) and Cy5.5 (acceptor). In the presence of target cDNA, these two primerswill join together in an LDR to form a molecular beacon. The two dyes in themolecular beacon were brought in close proximity to undergo fluorescenceresonance energy transfer (FRET). A continuous flow microfluidic reactor wasdesigned and fabricated using a PMMA substrate to carry out the LDR. Thismicrofluidic device possessed serpentine channels to allow denaturing and thermalligation to take place in a sequential process in different isothermal zones.The resulting molecule beacons were examined using a laser-induced fluorescence(LIF) system, and the captured mRNAs could be directly counted at thesingle-molecule level to achieve quantitative information required to read outthe expression level of these targets.
During the development of new drug substance and drugformulations, there are a number of important chemical and physical questionsthat must be answered in order to satisfy FDA regulations. Many of these arerelated to the stability of a new drug, and require a detailed evaluation ofpotential degradation products as well as elucidation of decomposition mechanisms.HPLC coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) has emerged as apractical approach for detecting and identifying unknown degradation products.High mass accuracy, around 5 ppm, allows for molecular formula determinationswith the help of special system tools, and potential structures may be revealedthrough available formula database searching. High full mass range sensitivitypermits the detection of degradation products to very low levels. In addition,TOF-MS is capable of producing accurate isotopic ratios, and therefore reducingthe number of possible compounds significantly by eliminating those having nonmatchingisotopic ratios.
In the current work, an HPLC-UV-MS method has been developedfor studying the high-temperature degradation of indomethacin and mefenamicacids. Indomethacin mainly undergoes thermal degradation by cleavage of theamide bond and loss of the carboxyl group, whereas mefenamic acid primarilydegrades via loss of water and the carboxyl group. The current talk considersoptimization of both the HPLC separation and API ionization conditions, and theidentification of major degradation products is based on exact molecularweight, isotopic ratios, and fragment ion information. The degradation sampleswere analyzed under different chromatographic conditions (e.g., eluent additives,binary composition, and pH), ionization methods (ESI and APCI), and detectionmodes (positive and negative ion spectra).
Garlic has long been utilized in the Asiatic and westerncultures as a prophylactic and therapeutic medical agent. Nowadays, it is knownfor its potential anticarcinogenic and antioxidative properties due to thepresence of various selenium species. On the other hand, onion is alsoconsidered to provide health benefits in the prevention of some diseases.Garlic and onions are known to be bioaccumulators of selenium. The most abundantselenospecies determined in garlic and onions are selenomethionine,γ-glutamyl-Se-methyl-seleno-cysteine, and seleno-methyl-Se-cysteine. Presentedhere is the comprehensive speciation of organic and inorganic selenium species,via liquid chromatography-particle beam/mass spectrometry (LC-PB/MS) usingelectron impact (EI) and glow discharge (GD) as ionization sources, towards theanalysis and characterization of selenium-enriched green onion.
The separations of the selenium species from standardsolutions (sodium selenate, sodium selenite, selenomethionine, selenocystine,and Se-methyl-selenocysteine) and selenium-enriched green onion extract werecarried out by reversed-phase chromatography using a gradient elution system ofwater-methanol-trifluoroacetic acid with an analysis time of less than 20minutes. Initially, the course of the separation was followed by measuring theabsorbance at 210 and 254 nm. Evaluation of the EI source (electron energy andsource block temperature) and the GD source (discharge pressure and current)parameters was performed to determine the optimal operating conditions bymonitoring the analytes' intensities and the fragmentation patterns. Theanalytes eluting from the chromatographic column undergo nebulization, followedby aerosol desolvation and ionization of dry analyte particles reaching theionization source. The GD and EI processes yield mass spectra which reflect thechemical species eluting from the column. The GD ion source provides EI-likemolecular fragmentation of the eluting compounds, allowing spectral librarycomparison (when available). Analytical response characteristics were obtainedfor each of the selenium species, and detection limits on the single-nanogramlevel were achieved. LC-PB/MS approach with the versatile interchangeable EI/GDsources provides comprehensive speciation analysis of the selenium species;therefore, it is believed to be applicable for the study of fundamentalmetabolic studies.
Although microdialysis perfusion is a routine technique forstudying many analytes in the ECF, it suffers from two important drawbacks. Ithas poor temporal resolution (typically several minutes) usually dictated bythe analysis time, and is limited to those compounds that are not activelymetabolized in the extracellular space and remain fairly stable during thecollection period, thus making it difficult to measure molecules such as nitricoxide.
Recently, a novel instrument (BioStat) using digital signalprocessing technology was coupled with the newest generation of analyte-specificimplantable electrodes to provide an approach with high temporal resolution andspecificity.
Presented here is an assessment of such a system. Electrodesspecific for either NO (100 and 600 micron tip diameters, 2 mm active length,hydrophobic membrane type, held at +865 mV relative to Ag/AgCl) or glutamate(180 micron tip diameter, 1 mm active length, biosensor type, held at +600 mVrelative to Ag/AgCl) were implanted in the hippocampus (from Bregma (mm): AP−5.0; LR 5.0: DV −7.0) of chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. Under in vitroconditions, sensors were shown to remain stable (2% drift over 3 hours and 12%over 4.5 hours) for more than 12 hours. Once implanted, sensor responseremained stable for the duration of experiments (2-3 hours).Sensitivity in vitro was approximately 262 pAmps/nM for NO and 245 pAmps/microMfor glutamate.
The response at the nitric oxide electrode was shown todecrease following IP injection of the nNOS-specific inhibitor 7-nitroindazole(200 mg/kg in corn oil) by 21% after 42 minutes and 77% after a secondadministration (100 mg/kg). No effect on the NO electrode response was seenfrom IP and IV administration of L-Arg or L-NAME. The glutamate sensor showed alow and less than expected change in response following IP administration ofkainic acid (13 mg/kg). Interaction between hippocampal NO and glutamate wasfurther examined pharmacologically.
The piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is ahighly sensitive mass-measuring device on a surface, and has been used as abiosensor in aqueous solutions with its properties of nonlabel and real-timemonitoring. Applications of QCM instruments cover wide range of research fieldssuch as protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction,material-biomolecule interaction, and material evaluations. In some cases (e.g.,protein samples dissolved in highly viscous solution such as glycerol), viscousloading significantly affected signal of mass load of protein adsorption on aQCM. Recently, we succeeded to develop the separate monitoring system of massload and viscous load by using frequency F2 measurement of QCM. In this study,we demonstrated some applications by using this system, such as viscoussolution-dissolved protein adsorption, ethanol-dissolved molecule adsorption,cation-dependent DNA conformation change, and temperature-dependentconformation change of polymer materials. We could analyze these reactions thatwere complicated by using conventional QCM system; these results can expand thepossibility of QCM instruments as biosensors (see Figure 7).

A new sensitive and selective flow injectionchemiluminescence method for the determination of hydroquinone over the rangeof 1.1 × 10−7–5 × 10−6 M will bedescribed. The method is based on chemiluminescence emission during theoxidation of hydroquinone by potassium persulfate in alkaline medium.Interference was considered, and some cations in reaction increase or decreasechemiluminescence intensity. Method development includes optimization ofreagent concentrations and flow conditions. Detection limit is 4.5 × 10 −8. Themethod also has good selectivity. The method is simple, fast, selective, and precise.			
The recent pet food contamination incident in North America highlights the need for conclusive andrapid analyses of melamine and its metabolites (ammeline, ammelide, andcyanuric acids) in pet food, animal feed, and tissue samples. As documented inthe Washington Post of May 7 (2007), an unknown number of cats and dogs in USA  became ill or died from eating certain brands of pet food. This resulted in the recall ofmillions of pounds' pet food. The formation of sharp melamine-cyanuric acidcrystals in the kidneys of animals which consumed the tainted pet food wasfound to be the probable cause of illness, in some cases leading to death. Thisoutbreak has fueled the latest public outcry for increased, accurate, and rapidanalytical food safety testing among manufacturers and government regulatoryagencies. Confirming the widespread nature of this contamination, the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) reported that melamine was found in wheat glutenand rice protein concentrated in USA, all imported from China  and intended for use in pet food. Melamine contamination has also beenfound in animal feed causing concern about migration of these products intothe human food supply.
Here, we show the use of Ultra Performance LC with PDA andMS detection to quantitate melamine and the associated compounds of ammeline,ammelide, and cyanuric acids with a runtime of less than 2 minutes. A simplesample preparation procedure applicable to many pet food matrices isillustrated.
“Cork taint”—a musty-mouldy off-odor—represents one of the most serious problems in the wine industry. 2,4,6-Trichloroanisole (TCA), along with other compounds, is known to be responsible for this effect. The wine industry is losing about $100 million annually in USA alone, due to TCA problems. The problem could be in the billions of dollars worldwide. For this purpose, the present work reports an optimized method based on headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatographic (GC) separation and electron capture detection (ECD) for rapid TCA determination. The method was validated after a lawsuit has been filed against a stopper manufacturing firm, claiming that the agglomerate corks have ruined 80 000 liters of red wine with a retail value of more than $2500000.
The best analytical conditions were obtained using 15 minutesof incubation time (60°C) with a polydimethylsiloxane 100 μm (PDMS) fiber, and 10minutes of extraction time (250°C) following a GC separation in a DB-Waxcolumn. The quantification limits were 4 ng/g of cork and 1 ng/L of wine. Theoptimized method showed good sample throughput, and TCA values ranging within23–294 ng/L were obtained in the samples (the aroma detection threshold of TCA in wine has beendetermined as ranging from 1.4 to 4 ng/L, depending on wine type).
This method is a real solution for screening of oakchips/shavings prior to use, and may reduce the risk of wines becomingcontaminated with chloroanisoles.
As a nutrient, vitamin C (L-ascorbate or ascorbic acid)daily requirements are a matter of ongoing debate. However, it is an importantnutrient for higher primates playing an essential role as a cofactor for someenzymatic metabolic reactions and also as an important antioxidant protectingagainst oxidative stress. Ascorbic acid is manufactured internally by almostall organisms except humans; so it is an essential additive to the human dietand has become one of the biggest food additives in the food and beverageindustries. Nutritional labeling requirements state that vitamin C content mustbe stated in terms of % daily requirment contained in the product per serving whichrequires manufacturers to quantitatively analyze the level contained or addedto their products. Historically, this determination was performed byhigh-performanc liquid chromatography or a less accurate titration.
Ascorbic acid can now be quickly and accurately determinedin a variety of juice products and food matrices utilizing discrete technologyand an enzymatic process which selectively isolates L-ascorbic acid. The firststep involves ascorbic acid and other reducing agents (x-H2) assayedquantitatively through a rapid five-minute reduction of the tetrazolium saltMTT to a formazan in the presence of an electron carrier. The formazan itselfis what can be photometrically recorded in the visible range at 578 nm. Thesecond step isolates L-ascorbic acid by an enzymatic reaction which selectivelyremoves the ascorbic acid from the sample after which another photometricreading is taken and subtracted from the total reducing substances.
The completely automated analysis occurs in less than 17minutes with little to no sample preparation. Six to twelve reactions occursimultaneously as the instrument utilizes micro 12-cell cuvettes and is acontinuous feed system.
Different analytical methods and instrumentation for thedetermination of volatile components in foods and beverages are available, andmany of them are based on the reconcentration of the head space before theinjection into a capillary column. The aim is to increase the sensitivity forthe minor components, usually the most interesting ones, for thecharacterization of the volatile fraction of food samples. The volatilecompounds responsible for the typical aroma of foods often characterize thequality profile of the product, and their identification and quantitation allowto determine possible adulteration or contamination.
To detect and recognize the volatile components present inthe matrix, a suitable instrumentation is required for a reproducible headspace transfer to the analytical column and for an appropriate detection. Amultidetection system (MS and GC detectors) is advisable for a selectiveidentification of the targets.
A deeper insight into a complex flavor composition is alsopossible by coupling the headspace sampling technique with a comprehensivetwo-dimensional gas chromatographic system (GC × GC), taking advantage of itsenhanced separation power.
The presentation will demonstrate the benefits of using arobotic autosampler for both the injection of large amount of head space vaporsand for handling the solid phase microextraction (SPME) device for an automatedextraction and reconcentration of the volatile components.
To maximize the sensitivity and the chromatographicperformance, both sampling techniques have been coupled with a Cold Trap placedinside the GC oven in order to reconcentrate and reinject the volatilecomponents in a narrow band, permitting the use of highly efficient narrow borecapillary columns.
The presentation will describe the chromatographic systemsand methods used for the quality characterization of edible oils and beverages,showing examples of head space analysis of drinking water and white wine.
The sliver sensor consists of a miniature array of sensingcapsules that change color in response to concentrations of different analytessuch as H+, Na+, K+, glucose, and potentially other metabolites. The sliverresides in the interstitial fluid in the dermis, where it remains visible fromoutside the skin. Extensive in vitro testing has shown that the device respondsto sudden concentration changes within 5 minutes and that diffuse reflectancemeasured with a CCD camera can be used to determine the respective concentrations.Initial in vivo studies proved that the sliver sensor is biocompatible for atleast a month. In this work, we have tested if color of the sensing capsules inthe dermis can be reconstructed from CCD recordings made outside the skin.Results of in vivo tests on color reconstruction and concentrationdetermination will be reported in this presentation.
Column aging as well as other instrumental and chemicaleffects can cause chromatographic retention times to vary from their originalvalues. Various approaches have been used to compensate for these effectsincluding changing instrument parameters and using reference peaks to adjustthe target retention times. None of these conventional approaches can adjustboth the retention time targets and timed peak processing events on thechromatogram where the deviations occur, and some involve modifications ofexperimental conditions that can cause unexpected deviations from optimumseparation conditions.
Galaxie's SmartTimeUpdate is a novel approach applicable toboth gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (HPLC), which usestraditional reference peaks to automatically correct both retention times andpeak processing timed events without any need to alter instruments' parameters.When reference peak times have shifted, both the timed events' table and thepeak detection table are automatically modified resulting in peak processingparameters that can accurately process the new chromatograms. In 				Figure 8, when thechromatogram retention times have shifted, the original times for events areincorrect and the corrected times produce proper peak processing. Systematicchanges in retention times can be tracked as systematic alterations in peakprocessing events. If normal retention time variations are of the same order ofmagnitude as the systematic changes, SmartTimeUpdates can be scaled to shiftpeak times and timed events a fraction of the measured change, thereforepreventing overcompensation of the time shift.
With OnPeak events which start and stoppeak processing events when peaks are detected and therefore compensate forpeak shape changes, Galaxie with SmartTimeUpdates can compensate for anychanges in chromatographic peak characteristics.

In many laboratory systems, the reporting element of a system can be an afterthought of the initial design. This can lead to poorreporting of the data or large amounts of time dedicated to the manual creationof reports. We make a large investment on the tools needed to collect data andresults, and therefore we should also invest on clear reporting of these results.
This session will cover techniques and tools for reportingdata collected in the lab. We will look at different approaches and tools thatcan be used to automate the reporting of results as well as covering how tomake templates in commonly used formats for sharing results with otherinterested parties. By taking the time to implement an automated system forprofessional reporting, you can make the most of the investment in your data.
The identification of disease biomarkers may be helpful inunderstanding pathological mechanisms or for diagnostics. One of the mostpowerful methods for peptides and proteins' biomarker detection is massspectrometry. Recently, we have presented a technique for enhancing peptidedetection using MALDI-TOF-MS from biological fluids with a sub-micro-literdialysis device and microspotting technique. However, the discovery of possiblebiomarkers is a time-consuming task due to the complexity of the obtained massspectra. To address the complexity, a MATLAB algorithm is developed for findingmore or less abundant peptide peaks in mass spectra of vitreous collected fromcontrol or experimental patients. The mass spectra of 500 nL human vitreoussamples from diabetic-related eye disorder patients (proliferative diabeticretinopathy, PDR) and epiretinal membrane (control) patients were collectedfollowing protein removal with dialysis and microspot blotting. The spectrawere aligned using SpectAlign (version 2.3). The MATLAB algorithm subtractscontrol spectra from disease spectra giving m × n difference spectra, where mis the number of disease spectra and n is the number of control spectra. The moreabundant peaks are represented as peaks, and the less abundant peaks arerepresented as dips in the difference MS. The sample input spectra were dividedinto varying mass windows depending on the MS resolution to give approximatelyone peak per window. The individual windows were counted for a peak or dip fromall possible difference spectra and displayed as a frequency histogram.Criteria are applied to the frequency histogram to determine potential up- anddownregulated peptides. After analyzing mass spectra from 9 PDR samples and 9controls, 10 peaks were found to be more abundant relative to controls, and 4peptide peaks were found to be less abundant in more than 50% of thedifference spectra. The MATLAB result was confirmed by individual analysis ofspectra. Overall, this algorithm demonstrates the ability to easily interpretpossible peptide biomarkers from complex MALDI mass spectra.
The value of using tabulated GC retention data and massspectral libraries for determining the presence of target compounds in a sample(i.e., detection) is well established. Isolation of spectra not present in thetarget mass spectral library for nontarget compounds present in the sample ismuch less well developed. This paper starts by viewing the problem of spectraldeconvolution and isolation as a statistical hypothesis testing problem in ageneral function space with a defined inner-product. Placed in this context,isolation of unspecified spectra resembles singular value decomposition in thefunction space similar to principal component analysis. In this framework, therole of machine-to-machine variability, sample-to-sample variability, andscan-to-scan variability enters into the methods of detection andidentification in a consistent probabilistic manner. This paper presents thebasics of this approach and illustrates its application to chemical agentsimulants and toxic industrial chemicals. The resulting methodology is comparedwith commonly used deconvolution methods. We emphasize the ability of themethod to isolate unspecified mass spectra in the presence of known librarymass spectra for further examination.
High-resolution chromatography, accurate mass LC-MS, andsoftware tools have been combined to more efficiently correlate peptide mapswith protein structure. HPLC is the established first step in deducingstructure from these fragments because differences in sequence yieldchromatographically separate peaks. The resolution can be enhanced by applyingUPLC separation principles to the peptide mixtures. HPLC and UPLC peptide mapswill be compared. The optimized chromatography still requires confirmation ofpeak identity and purity; so it is useful to couple the separation to the exactmass measurements, which is possible with an oa-ToF mass spectrometer. Peptidescan be identified based on molecular weight, and coelutions can be detected.This additional information links the chromatographic pattern to the structureof the protein. At the same time, the comparison of the HPLC and UPLCseparations shows an improvement in the utility of the MS because the peptidespectra are simpler and easier to interpret when more completely resolvedsamples are introduced into the MS. Complete interpretation of complex LC/MSchromatograms with accurate mass measurement is time-consuming and labor-intensive.New specialized software has been developed for these large datasets. The peaksare detected by the Apex3D algorithm to deconvolute multiply-charged ions andcombine isotopes. These processed data are matched to the structural featuresof the proteins with rigorous comparison and search algorithms. The combinationof UPLC, orthogonal acceleration (oa-TOF MS), and advanced software acts synergistically to improve theinterpretation of peptide maps.
Automation of the mass spectrum interpretation is essentialto achieve a high-throughput mass spectrometry-coupled chromatographicqualitative analysis. The depth of the spectrum interpretation is highlycorrelated to the accuracy of the classification. Nowadays data-dependentacquisition techniques allow the users to obtain automatic tandem mass spectrabesides the molecular ion information in HPLC-MS. Unfortunately, the MS/MS spectrallibraries have some severe problems and are certainly unusable when analyzingnew compounds.
HPLC-MS/MS spectra—especially thoseobtained in ion trap instruments—show a rathersimplified pattern when compared to classical electron impact spectra, mainlydue to much lower excitation energies and the dominance of the closed-shellions in the fragmentation processes. Characteristic fragment peaks within acertain compound family of drug-like small molecules make the human massspectrum interpretation easy and straightforward. The aim of the present workis to provide an algorithm and a software tool that performs a human-likeinterpretation of mass spectral peaks of small molecules; therefore it can beembedded in an automatic qualitative analysis process with the aid of thepharmaceutical preparative chemistry.
The input of the algorithm consists of pairs of structuresand mass spectra, while the output is a series of numbers representing thelikelihood of the matches. The human interpretation is imitated with a combinedusage of an automated probabilistic rule induction technique and smallartificial neural networks. An abstract definition of the fragmentation rulesis provided. The rule induction part extracts fragmentation rules from positivetraining samples within the studied compound families, while the neural networkis trained to achieve a reasonable classification of the positive and negative“hits.” An example of the above algorithm is presented, along with the application in routine pharmaceuticalqualitative analysis.
Many laboratory information systems (e.g., LIMS andchromatography data systems) are classically deployed using a client/serverparadigm. Recently, vendors of many laboratory informatics software productshave offered deployment choices ranging from classical to novel ones. Inaddition to the classical ones, these include terminal services (Citrix) andWeb-based (Internet Explorer) services. These technologies provide differentlevels of connectivity and advantages, one versus the other.
In this presentation, the author will discuss the benefitsand drawbacks of each deployment choice and will explore the feasibility ofsingle deployment choices versus multiple choice deployments.
Laboratories have huge investments in their assets:facility, staff, instruments, and equipment. These assets must be maintained ina fashion that makes them always ready, that is, ready to go online and supportthe process or to analyze it. In this vein, established proactive maintenanceprograms are imperative. Proactive maintenance programs also fill compliancerequirements of licensing agencies.
TimeKeeper America (TKA) software is an asset management tool. TKA provides demonstrations of compliance to an auditor. Proactive maintenance monitoring programs are NELAP-requirement proactivemaintenance programs that help insure that when samples are logged into alaboratory the facility, the staff, and the instruments and equipment are fullyprepared for analysis. This in turn helps insure that data generated will behighly reliable. TKA also contains a demonstration of capability section. Thissubprogram can also be used to demonstrate calibration of equipment such asbalances, viscometers, and autopipetters. Another feature of TKA is a chemicalinventory section.
Unique features of the program include a “look aheadscheduler.” Color-coded pop-up messages give advanced notice when maintenanceactions are coming due. When a maintenance act is to be performed, click on thepop-up message and link to the SOP or the manufacturer's maintenance manual.Completed maintenance actions are sent to a secure report generator. Reportsare acceptable as legal exhibits.
LIMS-type softwaretrack samples from when they are acquired through to the final data stream andreport generation. TKA completes the other half of the circle. TKA tracks thefacility, staff, and instruments to insure that samples will be given thehighest-quality analysis available.
Industrial endeavors that involve the identification ofimpurities are increasingly challenged to shorten development timelines. Newanalytical tools are constantly investigated and evaluated to provideimprovements in efficiency and productivity. The combination of high-performanceliquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) continues to be a valuabletool for the identification of trace-level impurities. Recent improvements inresolution in chromatography and mass analysis formats have generated newspecifications for performance and considerations for application. Sensitivityand selectivity remain key analytical figures of merit for LC/MS platformsdedicated to trace-mixture analysis. Faster cycle times (chromatographic andmass) provide the ability to generate higher-quality data and more informationin less time. Shorter analysis times provide opportunities to improve existingmethod development strategies, and lead to significant cost savings.Furthermore, increased levels of automated software control providecapabilities for high-throughput analysis and facile report generation. Resultsthat demonstrate advances in LC/MS instrumentation for impurity identificationwill be presented. Faster analysis times, improved method developmentstrategies, and increased flexibility will be discussed.
The importance of mass accuracy, mass resolution, and widein-scan dynamic range for MS and multistage MS/MS data is demonstrated byreviewing results obtained using a new quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer(QTOF) with unique 4 GHz analog-to-digital acquisition electronics. Coelution ofcomponents and ion suppression can inhibit the detection of trace impuritiespresent in the complex mixtures. Maximizing chromatographic resolution using arapid resolution high-throughput eclipse plus C18 column (particle size of 1.8micron) with a rapid resolution LC produces narrow peak widths (seconds). Invery complex mixtures, however, compounds with the same nominal mass may stillbe present at the same retention time. The new 4 GHz analog-to-digitalelectronics along with new peak detection software enables greater resolving ofthese isobaric species by increasing resolving power to 10000 (>m/z 100).The identification of low-level impurities which co-elute with high-levelimpurities can now be detected over a wide concentration range of >5 ordersof magnitude using a new preamplifier design. Compounds present in the complexmixtures were automatically identified using analgorithm known as molecular feature extraction. Sample comparison wascompleted using another algorithm known as mass profiler that makes statisticalcomparison of the two samples. Results showing mass accuracy over a widedynamic range in scan and for both MS and MSMS mass spectra will be shown forseveral samples.
Impurity profiling during drug substance development is criticalfor its safety, efficacy, purity, stability, and quality. When unknownprocess-related impurities arise, impurity identification plays an importantrole in deeper understanding of the process and consequently improving thequality of the drug substance. Genotoxic impurities pose significant analyticalchallenges. In this presentation, case studies of impurity profiling, identification, andcontrol are reported using chromatographic separation (high-performance liquidchromatography and gas chromatography) interfaced with mass spectrometry foractive pharmaceutical ingredient (API) development.
In these days of tight budgets and the need to provide morelaboratory support with fewer resources, it has become a challenge for the labmanager to justify expensive laboratory instruments. This presentation willinclude a review of various types of expensive laboratory instruments, theadvantages and disadvantages of purchasing them, alternatives to purchasingthem, and the approach that must be taken to justify the purchase of expensive instruments.
The confirmation, detection, and quantification of proteinallergens in food are important issues for food safety. Measurements in complexfood matrices necessitate approaches in which the target proteins are measuredin the presence of complex matrices that also contain proteins. ELISA-basedmethods are typically used to measure allergens in food, and these can besensitive and specific. However, the possibility of cross-reactivity withrelated proteins and resultant false positive identification requires thatother confirmatory techniques be available for measuring allergens. Analyticalmethods that yield a direct molecular signature of the target allergen protein,such as mass spectrometry, are necessary for confirmation. Several massspectrometric approaches have been developed to address the measurement ofprotein allergens in food, including methods that fractionate and then enzymaticallydigest the target protein into characteristic peptides, followed by liquidchromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to fragment and confirm the peptidesequence. This approach can be used to definitively identify theallergen protein. MALDI-MS/MS can also be used for confirmation. This approachis not universally applicable, however, due to the nature of some food matricesand their interference in the fractionation/digestion process. Alternativeapproaches under development include the use of immunoaffinity methods toextract the target analyte from the food matrix, as would be done in ELISA,followed by elution of the protein from the antibody and analysis of theprotein by digestion and LC/MS/MS. The extension of all of these methods to truequantification is a difficult step, due to the need for internal standards. Wehave been investigating approaches for standardization, which includedevelopment of 18O stable labelled standards from matrix spikes aswell as the use of homologous proteins to standardize the entire method.
In recent years, the importance of chemical speciation, thatis, the determination of an element amongst its various oxidation states andmolecular or complex forms, has been recognized as more relevant than totalelemental concentration. Although the total elemental concentration is ofteneasier to evaluate, the bioavailability and toxicological information it yieldsare inherently limited. It has been demonstrated that chromatographicseparation alone cannot provide sufficient qualitative information for nativebiological samples, due to the unknown nature of the sample. For this reason,researchers have begun employing two separate instruments to obtain theelemental and molecular information from such samples. However, employingmultiple instruments for the analysis of a given sample has severaldisadvantages. In the work presented here, a single time-of-flight massspectrometer (TOFMS) will be described that utilizes two sources to obtaincomprehensive atomic and molecular information simultaneously.
The dual-source TOFMS has been designed and constructed inour laboratory. The current arrangement for the instrument utilizes inductivelycoupled plasma to obtain elemental, isotopic, and quantitative information.Meanwhile, an electrospray source is operated in parallel to provide molecularinformation. Due to the wide mass range and high spectral generation rate ofTOFMS, ions from both sources can be simultaneously sampled by a single massanalyzer to provide excellent temporal resolution of transient signals, whilesimultaneously simplifying peak assignment from a chromatographic separation.In addition, since only a single chromatographic separation is necessary forthe atomic and molecular channels, sample requirements, preparation time, andanalysis time can be significantly reduced. Results will be presenteddemonstrating the capability to operate both sources simultaneously.
Very often, the quantification of proteins in biologicalsystems is determined by the analysis of metals. However, by analyzing nonmetalelements present in proteins, a more qualitative picture can be formed.Phosphorus, in the form of phosphorylated sugars, is one of the most abundantnonmetal elements in proteins, and its determination can give insightfulinformation about the regulation of cellular activities by looking at extent ofphosphorylation and dephosphorylation [19].
Previous work in our laboratory has focused on the detectionof phosphorus (219.9 nm) and carbon (193.0 nm) in proteins using liquidchromatography-particle beam/hollow cathode-optical emission spectroscopy(LC-PB/HC-OES). This technique has proven to be a viable source for detectionof various proteins giving qualitative and quantitative data. The LC-PB/HC-OESsystem used previously consisted of a monochromator with one photomultipliertube (PMT), requiring repeated sample analysis to gain information for multipleelements.
Our laboratory has recently developed new instrumentationfor detecting multiple elements in a single-sample analysis, with LC-PB/HC-OESthrough the use of a high-resolution JY-5000 polychromator that has 27 PMTchannels (Figure 9). This technique allows simultaneous detection of nonmetaland metal elements in proteins, therefore, acquiring quantitative and qualitative data present todetermine specific proteins in biological systems.

Electric field gradient focusing (EFGF) is a uniqueseparation and preconcentration technique that depends on an electric fieldgradient and a dynamic counterflow to focus charged analytes, such as peptidesand proteins. Recently, we have successfully developed an EFGF devicecompletely fabricated with PEG-containing materials, including the substrate,hydrogel, and incorporated monolith, which have good resistance to proteinadsorption. In EFGF, the most important issue is the establishment of a stableelectric field gradient. The shape of the PEG hydrogel can be designed toproduce a linear or nonlinear gradient. The shape and stability of the electricfield gradient can be indirectly determined by the focused band positions ofstandard proteins at different counterflow rates because when the focused bandreaches its focusing position, the electric field strength is proportional tothe counterforce (i.e., dynamic counterflow). The effects of gradient shape onbandwidth and resolution were studied. In a nonlinear electric field gradient,the bandwidth was narrower in the steep part of the gradient; however, theresolution was improved in a shallow gradient. Influences of hydrogelcharacteristics, such as conductivity, ion transport and dimensions, and buffersolution composition, on EFGF performance were investigated. EFGF devices havebeen demonstrated to preconcentrate protein samples more than 10000-fold (see Figure 10).

Heparin oligosaccharides are highly sulfated linearpolysaccharides that display a wide range of biological activities throughinteraction with proteins, including growth factors and chemokines. Elucidationof the relationship between biological function and the microstructure of thesebiopolymers remains a challenge due to the complex heterogeneity of theirstructure. In this study, the electrophoretic mobilities of 11 heparindisaccharide standards were measured by CE and compared with group pKasdetermined through 1H NMR pH titration experiments. This information was usedto optimize the construction of a spectral database utilizing capillaryisotachophoresis coupled to NMR detection (cITP-NMR). In addition,conformational transformations induced by changes in disaccharide protonationstate were also investigated. Oligosaccharides obtained by depolymerization ofporcine heparin using heparin lyases were separated and analyzed by CE-UV, LC-MS,and cITP-NMR spectroscopies. CE-UV was used to profile the enzymatic digests,determining the complexity and electrophoretic identification of individualcomponents. Structural information was obtained by conducting cITP-NMRexperiments of selected digests and comparing the online spectra to thecITP-NMR database. Complementary structural information was also acquiredthrough the development of rapid LC-MS techniques. This work will enable futurestudies to examine the binding interactions of heparin and heparan sulfate withproteins.
Processing gram to kilogram quantities of target analyteshas led to the exploration of several high-throughput separation techniques.Among those investigated is steady state recycle (SSR). Similar to simulatedmoving bed (SMB), fractions are collected from the leading and trailing edgesof a chromatographic contor, while sample material is injected into theinterior. Purifying large amounts of analyte in the semipreparatory stage isideal for SSR and SMB. SSR facilitates the development of methods capable ofseparating 50 g to kilograms of product efficiently. Using polarimetry tooptimize the SSR method further improves the efficiency of method development,providing comprehensive data and leading to incisive development decisionsallowing the purifications of racemic compounds. Accurate sample injectionallowed continual 99% chiral separation after polarimetry optimization. We havedeveloped an efficient SSR optimization methodology that offers rapid developmentof chiral separation by SSR.
Proteomics is a major component of systems biology. Massspectrometry is the enabling technology for proteomics. To fully realize theenormous potential of lab-on-a-chip in proteomics, a major advance in interfacingmicrofluidics with mass spectrometry is needed. We have recently demonstratedthe first monolithic integration of a microfluidic channel with multinozzleelectrospray emitters via a novel silicon microfabrication process. Thesemicrofabricated monolithic multinozzle emitters (M3 emitters) can be readilymass-produced from silicon wafers. Each emitter consists of a parallel silicanozzle array protruding out from a hollow silicon sliver stem with the conduitsize of 100 × 10 micron. The dimension and number of free-standing nozzles canbe systematically and precisely controlled during the fabrication process. TheM3 emitters showed comparable performance to that of the commercial tips interms of stability and sensitivity for standard peptides and high molecularweight proteins. Multinozzle emitters are expected to ease the back-pressure andclogging problem that single-nozzle emitters have to cope with, especially asthe channel downsizes to submicron scale. Our current work aims to furtherintegrate the M3 emitters with front-end sample processing on a chip. Newdevelopments in the monolithic integration of sample loading and on-chipseparation will be discussed.

As a widely usedpowerful tool for analyzing biochemical molecules, matrix-assisted laserdesorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) shows excellent accuracy,high sensitivity, and good stability. However, for analyzing a multicomponentcomplex sample, MALDI-MS signals of peptides and proteins may be suppressed bysalts, detergents, and competitive analytes existing in the same sample. Toovercome this drawback, the use of chromatographic techniques to separatecomponents in complex samples is essential. Capillary electrophoresis (CE),especially free-solution CE, is rarely reported to be coupled with MALDIbecause the motion of analytes is driven by an electric field applied in thecapillary, which gives difficulties to interface CE separation with MALDIsample plates. Therefore, to couple CE and MALDI, analytes should befractionated after CE separation and introduced to a MALDI sample plate. Toachieve these tasks, we developed a microfluidic chip prototype with activeactuators. In the microfluidic chip, a row of fractionation valves is positionedabove the main channel which is a horizontal channel used as the capillary forCE separation. After sample loading in the double T-junction located to theleft, CE separation of analytes is carried out by applying voltage across themain channel. The fractionation valves close immediately after the CEseparation. Then, the microfluidic pump located on top of the main channel isactuated to pump the fractions of separated analytes down into reservoirsthrough the side channels connecting the main channel to the reservoirs, andthe fractions of the separated analytes are then taken out of the microfluidicchip for MALDI analysis (see Figure 11).
Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) is an innovativeapproach to liquid-solid extraction. It is accepted under EPA Method 3545A for theextraction of conventional environmental toxins such as PCBs, dioxins, PAHs,diesel range organics, and chlorinated pesticides. ASE is a well-establishedtechnique currently used in environmental labs across the world. Using ASE,samples can be automatically extracted over several hours without userintervention. Each individual sample extraction takes place in less than 15minutes and with small volumes of solvent. The automation of the ASE apparatusallows laboratories to improve their productivity because samples can beextracted and prepared for analysis without any input or operation from theanalyst.
New techniques have been developed that enhance theproductivity of ASE even more. For example, extracts can be collected in vialsor bottles that are directly compatible with an evaporator apparatus. This caneliminate or minimize sample handling and the transfer of samples from onecontainer to another. Another example is the use of selective adsorbents in theextraction cell with the sample. This procedure can produce interference-free extracts,thus eliminating the need for postextraction cleanup procedures such as gelpermeation chromatography (GPC) or multiple-column cleanup. Byeliminating these additional sample preparation procedures, the overallproductivity of an environmental lab can be greatly enhanced. Comparisons oftime and labor involvement for traditional techniques and ASE techniques willbe presented. We will also present a discussion of additional means to enhancethe productivity of labs beyond what is currently possible.
Pesticide pollution is a subject of global concern andalthough many countries have now banned the use of organochlorine pesticides,which can linger in the environment and can contaminate water sources.Organochlorine pesticides can be toxic to animals and humans; so methods whichaccurately and easily quantify them are essential. A recent study has beendone, with the organochlorine pesticides analyzed, as well as a part of astandard mix consisting of alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-benzene hexachloride(BHC), 4,4′-DDD, 4,4′-DDE, 4,4′-DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, endrin aldehyde,endrin ketone, endosulfan (I, II and sulfate), heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide,and methoxychlor.
The disk uses divinyl benzene (DVB) adsorbent, and isdesigned and certified for automation. In the study, the extractors pass a 1 Lsample of water that has been spiked with standard, through the disk to collectthe analytes, and are then eluted in a small volume of solvent into a VOA vial—all in oneautomated procedure. The eluents were then dried and concentrated. Automation allows increased levels of productivity andprecision, making the SPE disk an efficient alternative to liquid-liquidextraction, as well as to other SPE methods.
The FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of seafood;however, efficient monitoring of aquacultured fish for residues is very limited.Optimizing the preparation of the sample for analysis not only lowers the LODbut also enhances the quality of the results by lowering RSDs. The systempresented is a totally automated SPE with HPLC analysis capabilities. It allows unattended sample preparations and online analysis via HPLCwithout manual intervention. Method performance was evaluated over several daysof replicated samples of controlled salmon, salmon fortified with a drugmixture, and salmon dosed with a representative from several drug classes(quinolones, floroquinolones, macrolides, malachite green, imidazoles,tetracyclines, penicillin, and betalactams). The complete automated systemallows for ease of use and transfer of the method between sites minimizing downtime and time required for validation and calibration.
Recent developments in selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry(SIFT-MS) have enabled the routine detection and quantification of compounds atpart-per-trillion (ppt) concentrations (by volume). SIFT-MS detects trace VOCsin real time from whole-air samples by utilizing well-characterized gas phasereactions of multiple soft chemical ionization agents. The reaction conditionsare precisely controlled in the flow tube enabling VOCs to be detectedin real time but also to be quantified absolutely based on their known ionproducts and reaction rate coefficients. The use of different chemical ionizationagents provides multiple independent quantitative measurements of each targetcompound, greatly enhancing the specificity of the technique compared to otherreal-time MS technologies.
In this paper, several applications of SIFT-MS to the foodindustry will be demonstrated. VOCs are often the compounds responsible forimparting flavor and aroma to food and beverage. Hence, there is a wideningbody of research in areas such as aroma characterization, flavor release, anddetection of off-flavors or off-aromas.
Chocolate and cheese are both challenging food for analysisusing existing real-time mass spectrometry techniques due to their very complex headspaces. In this paper, we will present results that demonstrate the capabilitiesof SIFT-MS for detection of important aroma compounds in both chocolate andcheese. SIFT-MS proves to be very successful in detecting and quantifying, forexample, the characteristic pyrazines of chocolate and organosulfur compoundsof cheese.
The technology's potential as a rapid sensitive quality assurancetool will also be emphasized.			
Ethoxyquin (6-ethoxy-1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline-EQ) is a commonly usedantioxidant in food products and animal feed for preserving vitamins andlipids. EQ undergoes oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis at ambient conditionsresulting in degradation products. A number of such degradation products havebeen reported in the literature. Recently, a new EQ degradation product wasdiscovered during reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) analysis ofantioxidant formulations and animal feed samples. The antioxidant formulationanalysis involved acetonitrile extraction of the samples followed by separationof extracted components on a C18 RPLC column. The separated components were thendetected with a UV/Vis diode array detector (DAD). Water and acetonitrile wereused as the mobile phase with a linear gradient elution program. The mobile phaseflow rate was set at 1 mL min−1. The degradation product was formed duringpassage of EQ through certain C-18 columns. The extent of the degradation productformation was dependent on source and age of the column. The degradationproduct was isolated and characterized with UV and LC-ESI MS analysis. Analysisshowed that the degradation product results from catalytic hydrolysis of EQ onsilica surfaces.
Alpha hydroxy acids are important precursors of amino acidsin biological systems, and are naturally present in biological species. Thesemolecules are also used as feed supplements. Efficacy of a-hydroxy acids uptakeis important for nutritional studies, and method for determination of thechemical has been reported. However, the methodologies are tedious, requiring anumber of sample preparation steps. A simple approach has been developed for quantitativedetermination of 2-hydroxy-4-butanoic acid (HMB) and pantothenic acid in bloodserum and seawater samples. In the approach sample matrices seawater orbiological fluids were freeze-dried, and the dried residues were extracted withsolvents, such as ethanol or acetone. Solvent was then removed from theextracts under a gentle nitrogen stream; the sample was reconstituted insuitable media (water; methanol or water; acetonitrile mixtures). The extractswere then introduced into a liquid chromatography column for separation. Theseparated components were determined quantitatively with a UV absorption detectoror ES-MS operating the negative ion mode. Validation experiments with fortifiedsimulated seawater and bovine blood serum samples showed that analytes'recoveries were consistently within the 90–100% range.Analytes were readily monitored over 0.1–50 mg L−1concentrations' range. Analytes at concentrations down to μg L−1 could bedetermined through esterification of the extracted analytes followed by GC-EIMSanalysis.
In speciation analysis, it is important that the originalstate of the sample at the time of sampling be preserved until measurement.However, in complex biological matrices, many factors can cause an alterationof the natural species distribution, of which several can be found in theanalytical method.
In the presented work, a sample preparation with alkalinedigestion and aqueous phase derivatization has been applied. NaBEt4 was used toconvert inorganic (Hg2+) and methylmercury (MeHg+) into alkylated derivatives.
The volatile mercury compounds were separated on an HP-1GC-column, and element-selective detection was carried out with inductivelycoupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and microwave-induced plasma atomicemission spectroscopy (MIP-AES).
The presented data reveal unwanted species transformation inaqueous standards and fish tissue samples. The reduction of MeHg+ and Hg2+ to elemental mercury (Hg0) during the derivatization was observed, as well as transalkylation reactions duringstorage periods.
The interconversions could be detected and traced by means ofspecies-specific isotope dilution (IDMS) and single-standard spikingexperiments. However, of these two methods, only IDMS is able to correctobserved transformation reactions.
Automated chromatographic method development has recentlybecome a topic of considerable interest to the analytical chemistry world. Thedesign of effective chromatographic methods is a complex task involving theoften conflicting goals of separation robustness, resolution of all componentsof interest, and fast runtime. The chromatographer has an unprecedented arrayof tools available for this difficult task, including ultrahigh performanceliquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, unique new mobile phaseselectivities, chemometric component detection and tracking, automateddecision-making, and workflow and project management software.
While the method development toolset has advanced considerablyover the last few years, method development strategies have remained fairlystagnant. This paper will present new strategies for chromatographic methoddevelopment, which leverages these modern method development tools, resultingin increases in method development efficiency. The strategies shown aredesigned to increase the effectiveness and rigor of method development, whiledecreasing the amount of time during which users are required to manuallyreview method development data. A combination of screening and optimizationmethod development "waves" maximizes the selectivity spaceinvestigated without sacrificing effectiveness of chemometric peak tracking.Instrument control is leveraged to minimize the time required to configureinjection sequences. The approaches will be illustrated with several real-worldexamples.
CoronaTM charged aerosol detection in high-performanceliquid chromatography (HPLC) has recently become commercially availablealthough the detection mechanisms are not well understood. The goals of thisresearch were to gain (better understand this new detection method for HPLC methoddevelopment by determining the basic chromatographic parameters that have aneffect on this detector). These include the composition of the mobile phase and itsrelationship with the baseline signal, the determination of the amount ofmobile phase that is associated with detector charging, effects on analyteresponse and how it is affected by changes in mobile phase composition, theeffects of volatile mobile phase additives, and the determination of the actualamount of analyte that is being detected by the electrometer. In addition todeveloping a better understanding of charged aerosol detection, applicationswere examined, compared, and contrasted to current detection methods for HPLC,such as ultraviolet (UV) detection. The application that was chosen was pharmaceuticalcleaning validation, of which HPLC with charged aerosol detection proved to bean acceptable technique for trace-level analysis of drug substance on typicalpharmaceutical manufacturing equipment surfaces. HPLC-charged aerosol detectionwas also examined for general pharmaceutical analysis and the ability of thistechnique to be fully validated to the current International Conference onHarmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals forHuman Use (ICH) and United States Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines. Again,HPLC-charged aerosol detection proved itself as an acceptable technique, andseveral pharmaceutical assays for in-process control, impurities, and drugsubstance purity were validated.
Unknown compounds are often closely related to a leadcompound: degradation products, impurities, or metabolites. Traditionally, themass spectral dataset of that lead compound is used to work out thefragmentation pathways, and unknown compounds are then identified based on thechanges in the masses of various fragments. This approach works well, but itcan be very time-consuming.
Systematic bond disconnection has been used to assignaccurate mass fragments to known compounds. A similar approach can also be usedto assign subfragments of modular structures to specific molecularsubstructures of a lead compound. The heavy atom distribution of modularstructures, derived from the mass spectral data, is compared to the heavy atomdistribution of the molecular structures to find matches. (Heavy atoms areatoms of elements other than hydrogen.) Only the modular structures thatcorrelate with the molecular structures are saved, and a monochrome molecularstructure can then be color-coded with the same color scheme as the modularstructures. This makes the fragmentation easy to visualize.
By using the modular structures that match the lead compoundas templates, related unknown compounds can now be identified by comparingmodular structures to modular structures. The modular structures of the unknowncompound that best match the templates are saved and linked to the templatemodular structure that they most closely match. For correlating relatedcompounds to a lead compound of known structure (the template approach), thisapproach makes it very easy to visualize where changes have occurred.
Atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (AP-MALDI TOF-MS) is notorious forsensitivity to sample preparation. Specific ratios of salt analyte and matrixcombinations are needed to obtain an optimized spectrum. In synthetic polymerAP-MALDI analysis, both the salt and matrix are needed in order to obtainanalyte signal. In synthetic polymer analysis, optimized signal is necessarydue to the distribution of molecular masses present. This investigation usesthe synthetic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) to discover the optimal ratiofor analysis by AP-MALDI. PEG samples of varying molecular mass were used todetermine if the differences in the weight would impact the optimization. Ithas been determined that spectral intensity will vary depending on the ratiosof matrix, analyte, and salt which are utilized.
We are developing an online interface for MALDI of collectedbioaerosols that is coupled to an ion mobility time of flight massspectrometer. The detection of biological agents presents significantchallenges for analytical instrument technology due to the need for rapidanalysis coupled with the complex nature of potential sample contaminants.Biological warfare (BW) agents are typically dispersed as aerosol particles,and therefore detection instrumentation must be fast, sensitive, and selectivefor positive detection with minimal false alarms. Furthermore, portable instrumentsthat can function in harsh environments with minimal operator intervention arerequired.
We are developing bioaerosol ion mobility mass spectrometry(BIMMS) for real-time detection and analysis of collected bioaerosols.Particles are collected on a target that mechanically transports the particlesto a MALDI ion source. Ions are formed by 337 nm UV or 3 μm IR MALDI.Separation occurs in a 20 cm ion mobility cell at 10 torr helium buffer gas.Ions pass through a 0.5 mm orifice into a differentially pumped region beforebeing extracted into a 20 cm orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer foranalysis. Initial studies are focused on the detection and identification ofthe biological warfare simulants Bacillus subtilis (BG), Bacillusthuringiensis (BT), and Erwinia herbicola (EH) against a backgroundof dust, salt, and pollen. Mass spectra of collected bacteria show distincttrend lines associated with different components of bacteria and complexmixtures with little interference. These particular fingerprints can be usedfor the detection of BW agents in real time.
Recent exploration into nonmechanical valves hasdemonstrated that bicelle liquid crystal solutions can be used as a means fordirecting fluids in microfluidic channels. However, a systematic examination ofthe optimum phospholipid solution required an advanced field delivery platform.Using Peltier modules, rather than circulating water, and motorized magnetcontrol, rather than manual placement, has proven successful in automatingthese nonmechanical valves. This paper describes a simple, yet more effectiveand portable, platform.
The concept of capillary electrophoresis (CE) in chip formatcan be seen as one of the outstanding milestones in modern lab-on-chipdevelopment. Commercial devices are now available at the market. But,further efforts are essential to get broad acceptance of these “high-tech”products in the analytical lab. Cost reduction seems to be a central challenge,extending the topic of “Electrochemical detection: small is beautiful”to the economic dimension. Here, we present a new device to meet this goal byintroducing a chip-based CE system with electrical detection.
The device features the combination of two advantages: (i) substitutionof conventional CE glass chips by tailor-made polymer material chips which canbe mass-fabricated at low production costs, and (ii) electrical analytedetection by contactless conductivity measurement of high-frequency signals,which needs only a simple detector arrangement and low-cost measurement equipment.This avoids disadvantages of direct-contact electrochemical measurementsas well as sophisticated optical detection.
Technical parameters of the portable compact cost-efficientdevice and results of test measurements will be given. Applications will be demonstrated for the determination of organic acids in wine.
The combination of the 850 professional IC, the 858professional sample processor, and the MagIC Net software offers a variety ofsophisticated sample preparation techniques. One of these is automatedintelligent dilution.
In order to perform automated dilutions, the above-mentionedinstrument setup is additionally equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an 800Dosino. The latter aspirates a defined volume of a concentrated sample, andtransfers it to the mixing vessel. Subsequently, the diluent generallyultrapure water is dosed into the mixing vessel. After intensive stirring, theperistaltic pump of the sample changer transfers the sample to the injectionvalve of the ion chromatograph, where the sample constituents are separated anddetected. After the quantitation of the sample's constituents, the softwareverifies if the concentrations are within the calibration range. If this is thecase, the next sample will be analyzed. If not, the software, reanalyzes the sample after calculatingthe appropriate dilution factor.
This paper will give a description of the straightforwardanalytical setup, and will demonstrate the usefulness of the automatedintelligent dilution in a number of typical analytical chemistry applications.
Today's analytical chemist faces an increasing number ofsamples to be analyzed and a need to maximize throughput while still ensuringthat the highest quality in the resulting data is achieved. There is thereforean increasing need for automation during sample preparation. Many instrumentsare available that have been created to automate specific sample preparationtechniques. As a result, a number of different instruments are needed, and eachof these systems has its own controlling software.
A single robotic X-Y-Z coordinate autosampler commonly usedfor sample introduction in GC or HPLC can be used to perform a wide variety ofsample preparation techniques using a single instrument and controllingsoftware. The new Maestro software allows the user to control an expanded listof sample preparation techniques such as derivatization, saponification, esterification,analytical weighing, filtration, and solid phase extraction. In addition toease of use and intuitive windows-based programing, the software includes toolsto automate and optimize parameters assuring efficient sequence creation andmaximum sample throughput. The sampler can be configured as part of a GC or LCsystem, or can be configured as a benchtop workstation. In this paper, we discuss various samplepreparation techniques available when using the robotic autosampler inconjunction with the new software. Examples of automating techniques such assolid phase extraction and Twister solvent back-extraction for HPLC andsample weighing are shown.
A novel automated solid phase extraction (SPE) system with onlineinjection into LC- or GC-MS was evaluated for different food and environmentalsamples. All components of the system were attached to a standard laboratoryautosampler. Standard 1, 3 or 6 mL SPE cartridges which were shortened andequipped with a transport adapter could be used with the system. Solventtransfer was done via an autosampler syringe providing an accurately controlledflow resulting in very good repeatability and recovery. Concentration andderivatization steps were successfully automated. Each step of the process couldbe programed by software.
Some examples reveal the performance of the describedautomated SPE system. Malachite green and a metabolite could be analyzed infish by LC/Ion trap MS. Fish samples were extracted with acetonitrile/water,and the extract was cleaned up automatically by SPE followed by onlineinjection into LC-MS.
Aflatoxines were determined from food. The extracts werecleaned up via automated SPE with immunoaffinity cartridges. This was followedby automated derivatization of the analytes with bromine and injection of theresulting solution into LC/Ion trap MS.
A third application was the determination of 16 EPA PAH inenvironmental samples. Sample extracts (hexane) wereautomatically cleaned up over silica gel SPE cartridges followed by onlinelarge volume injection into GC/MS.
All described applications show good repeatability andrecovery. Automation of the SPE provides time savings, while limiting exposureof lab personnel to solvents and reagents. This makes the automated SPE avaluable tool for sample preparation in LC and GC analyses.
The ability to detect and quantitate drug metabolites in theearly drug discovery phase can be limited because of the small available samplesize and the complex biological matrix background. To overcome this limitation,nanoflow LC-MS is one approach that can be used to increase sensitivity.
HPLC-Chip is a new nanoflow separation system wherecomponents such as the spray emitter and enrichment and separation columns aredirectly integrated into the chip. Workflows such as sample enrichment arefully automated and performed directly on the chip. The use of HPLC-Chip forroutine nanoLC has been demonstrated for biomarker discovery [20] andglycan analysis [21]. It has also been applied to the routine high-sensitivitydetection of metabolites in various biofluids [22].
We will review a new chip design with a high-capacityenrichment column specifically developed for the analysis of a wide polarityrange of pharmaceutical small molecules. Retention time precision was betterthan 0.2% RSD on an Agilent 6410 QQQ HPLC chip system (see Figure 12). Typical pharmaceuticalcompounds were detected with sensitivities in the lower fg range absolute oncolumn. Linearity for quantitation was achieved over a wide concentration range.Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic analytes in a log P range from 0 to 4 werereproducibly enriched on the new small molecule chip. To demonstrate chipperformance for DMPK samples, imipramine was analyzed out of human serum.Despite the complex biological matrices, low fg levels were detected.
The study of cellular metabolism in rapid time scales is atthe forefront of metabolomics. The study of amino acid flux in subminute timescales would yield insight into rapid changes in cellular metabolism as awhole. To this end, we have developed a rapid, online, amino acid flux analyzer(AAFA). The AAFA consists of a microbioreactor, derivatization chamber, andmicellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) instrument with laser-inducedfluorescence (LIF) detection. The microbioreactor is continuously perifusedwith a volume of 3 μL containing a monolayer of 105-106 cells. The amino acids in the effluent enter the chamber where they are derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde/CN-resulting in being fluorescentlytagged. The derivatized effluent is separated by an online, computer-controlledMEKC instrument with LIF detection in order to quantify the concentration ofeach amino acid. Immediately after each electropherogram is collected, anotherinjection is automatically performed. By integrating each peak in successiveelectropherograms, a graph of amino acid concentration versus time can beconstructed for each amino acid. We have demonstrated the separation of 18amino acids in less than 30 seconds in cell media with separation efficienciesof up to 3 × 106 plates per meter and a signal-to-noise ratio of>104. Furthermore, we have shown that the AAFA can be run continuously for more than two hours with relative standard deviations as lowas 5.4%. This method would allow the observation of dynamic changes in aminoacid flux due to various agents which are known to alter cellular metabolism. Thisresearch was supported by Grant U01 AI061223 from the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Diseases.
Monitoring of drug effects onto consciousness is animportant issue in intensive care medicine and in anesthesia when sedation isto be tailored to patients' real needs. In contrast to volatile anesthetics,real-time monitoring of commonly used intravenous anesthetics like propofol isnot yet available. Conventional determination of blood concentrations still requiressophisticated and time-consuming techniques.
				Methods. We applied SPME GC-MS and real-time PTR-MS to assessblood and breath concentrations of propofol in lab animals (pigs) and in 14mechanically ventilated patients. Propofol concentrations were assessed afterbolus application and in steady state. Results. SPME GC/MS headspacemethods for determination of propofol from human blood and breath showed goodlinearity over the physiological range (0.1–20 μg/mL in bloodand 0.3–30 ppb/V inbreath) yielding an R2 > 0.99 and RSD < 10%. Correlation coefficientbetween arterial blood concentrations and breath concentrations was 0.88 forthe 14 mechanically ventilated patients. In ventilated pigs, PTR-MS real-timemeasurements demonstrated pronounced changes of propofol breath concentrationsduring the first minutes after injection of the drug. Conclusion. Drugconcentrations in human blood and breath can be measured fast and precisely bymeans of SPME GC-MS. PTR-MS real-time measurement of exhaled propofolconcentrations provides information on distribution effects in the body.
Good correlations of propofol blood and breathconcentrations indicate that monitoring of exhaled propofol in steady stateconditions may act as a promising noninvasive tool for assessing blood concentration and depth of anesthesia.
The importance of blood stains has risen as forensic researchershave increased information that can be extracted from even small blood.Landsteiner's initial pioneering work on the A-B-O blood typing system was in1901; later, other specific antigens (e.g., Rh factors) were discovered todiscriminate among blood types. DNA analysis has proven to be the mostconclusive piece of evidence used for forensic blood analysis. However, methodsfor locating and confirming the presence of blood at crime scenes have remainedrelatively unchanged.
Presently, catalytic methods of detection are the standardfor crime scene examination. Chemical detection methods involve toxicchemicals, such as luminol, which also may compromise DNA integrity. Real-timedetection of blood stains by infrared spectroscopy (IR) addresses many of theissues with chemical detection and reduces analysis time. Hemoglobin, the majorprotein in hematocrit, and albumin, the chief component in plasma, producedistinctive IR absorbance in the 1650−1540 cm−1 spectral range of the amide Iand amide II bands.
Multiple substrates (i.e., olefin, nylon, and polyesterpolymers coated with Scotchguard and other stain release treatments) weretested and doped with various concentrations of blood. The feasibility of usingspectroscopic detection for rapid visualization of blood on fabric surfaces wasevaluated using diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS).Discrimination of blood-stained substrates from clean surfaces was achievablein the overwhelming majority of cases. Multivariate statistical methods wereutilized to determine both the optimal spectral region for discriminationbetween sample and substrate as well as the limit of detection for the method.
Sorbent polymers have the ability to trap and concentrate avariety of hazardous analytes including chemical agents, toxic industrialchemicals, and explosives. These sorbent polymers are used for a variety of applicationsincluding sensor coatings, microfabricated preconcentrators, SPME fibers, andmembranes. In this paper, we have developed and optimized a hyperbranchedhydrogen bond acid sorbent polymer(poly(methyldi(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-trifluoromethyl-2-hydroxypent-4-enyl)silane;HCSA2). HCSA2 can form reversible but strong hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bondbasic analytes. Physical properties of this polymer were tailored according tothe application where HCSA2 was to be coated. Membranes and SPME fibers requirethe viscosity of the polymer to be higher to avoid flow of the polymer. Thethermal stability of HCSA2 was also improved for all applications to preventdegradation of the polymer as the analyte was desorbed. The absolute andcomparative sorptive properties of the HCSA2 polymer were determined by coatingand testing on several different sensor types including: inverse gaschromatography (IGC) columns, SPME fibers, and a microfabricated preconcentratordevice (cascde avalance sorbent polymer array (CASPAR)). The results presentedwill encompass HCSA2 physical characterization and the polymer coating responseto hydrogen bond basic and other analytes.
Method development is still considered the crucialbottleneck that impedes productivity in analytical laboratories. One major challengewith LC methods is the selection of the appropriate stationary phase material.The use of integrated sample preparation by online SPE multiplies the effort asit becomes necessary to discover the best combination of SPE column andanalytical LC column. Optimization of eluting conditions from the SPE column,transfer to the analytical column, and the subsequent analytical separation canbe excessively time-consuming in such a coupled analytical procedure.
We present a new integrated system that allows automatic andintuitive scouting of columns, eluents, and other important method parameterslike column temperature. Two six-position column selection valves areintegrated in the column compartment to provide highest flexibility forautomation. Intelligent software makes parameter permutation easy, withoutrequiring method changes. The application of this system to automaticallyscreen SPE phases for loading capacity and optimal eluting conditions isdepicted. It is used to optimize the enrichment of a wide range of antibioticsin aqueous matrices. In a second step, the antibiotics mixture is dissolved inthe optimal SPE eluting solvent, and injected into a selection of differentanalytical columns. A set of 6 separation columns is combined with the use ofdifferent organic eluent components, buffers, and temperatures for automaticscreening. Peaks can be tracked via UV/Vis spectra or mass comparison. Aspreadsheet-based reporting tool provides a peak resolution chart that providesan instant overview of the results and makes it easy to find the best methodconditions.
The synthesis of large and focused chemical libraries allowspharmaceutical companies to rapidly screen large numbers of compounds againstdisease targets. Active compounds resulting from these screens aretraditionally ranked based on their activity, binding, and/or specificity.Turning these hits into leads requires further analysis and optimization of thecompounds based upon their physicochemical and ADME characteristics. Thecritical factor to consider in physicochemical profiling is throughput. Thebottlenecks to throughput include MS method optimization for a large variety ofcompounds and data management for the large volume of data generated.
Currently, experiments including solubility, chemical andbiological stability, water/octanol partitioning, PAMPA, Caco-2, and protein binding are usedto generate physicochemical profiles of compounds in drug discovery. Themeasurement of physicochemical properties from these studies is easily enabledusing chromatographic separation and quantitation using LC/MS/MS/UV. While thesample analyses may be efficient, the processing of the data and theinterpretation of the results often require tedious and time-consuming manualmanipulation and calculation.
This paper describes an approach to solving these problemsby the use of a novel software package that allows for the design ofexperiments, data acquisition, and the processing as well as report generationin a fully automated manner.
To demonstrate the usage of this software package, we havedeveloped an automated UPLC/MS/MS protocol for data generation. The dataacquired from multiple assays were processed by a single processing method, allin an automated fashion. As a result, the physicochemical profiling process wassignificantly simplified and throughput was increased.
Quercetin, a well-known phytoestrogen, has been reported toexhibit anticancer, antitumor, and other therapeutic activities of significantpotency. Despite these useful therapeutic activities, quercetin has beenreported to have pro-oxidative and mutagenic activities on biomolecules aswell. To date, few studies have reported quercetin interactions with thedouble-stranded DNA since such interactions induce DNA strand scission that cancause DNA damage, and, consequently, mutation. In this work, we report thereal-time monitoring of quercetin oxidation behavior and interactions with thecalf-thymus DNA in physiological medium as bulk electrolysis progressed.Electrochemical, UV-Vis, and GC-MS/LC-MS results revealed the quercetin degradationproducts.The UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies showed the modes ofinteraction between quercetin and ctDNA in physiological medium.
This paper will focus on the investigatory and developmentalstudies pertaining to the chemical make-up, source identification, and processcontrol of particulate contamination in a manufacturing environment. The methoddeveloped and utilized for this analysis is an automated electron beam scannerwhich determines the size, shape, and elemental composition of individualparticulates. Unique to this technique are both a fully integratedelectron beam and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer and also a databasestorage and data analysis software suite designed specifically forquality-control and quality-assurance scientists. A series of samples wereanalyzed from a subassembly which was found to be susceptible to failure due toparticulate contamination. In particular, it was determined that both the size of the particles but also theidentification and elemental composition of the particles. The keyassembly failures occurr due to the tight tolerance of the assembly and also thehardness of particles that were observed. In addition to an overview of thetechnological breakthrough developed for this instrumentation, thispresentation will focus on the data and trend analysis software, as well as theimpact of the particulates on the manufacturing process.
Solid phase extraction (SPE) is often chosen as a samplepreparation method to remove matrix effects from the sample prior to analysis.Removal of these matrix effects drastically increases the signal-to-noise ratioof the compounds of interest. SPE is commonly employed with biological sampleswhere the matrix interferes with detection of the compound or drug of interest,and in the environmental field where trace analysis is required and therefore largeamounts of sample (water) are processed. Optimization of the SPE procedure cangreatly affect the recovery of the analyte of interest. There are four basicsteps in every SPE procedure, that is, conditioning, loading, washing, andelution, and evaluating each of these steps can offer increased recovery andtherefore enhanced performance. Manually performing the methoddevelopment/optimization of an SPE method can be quite tedious and time-consuming,and therefore may never come to fruition. The automated system presented hasthe capabilities of performing multiple solvent deliveries, “collectionfractionation,” analysis of each and every step in a solid phaseextraction process that affects recovery and precision without manualintervention; the end result is an SPE method that is more robust with enhancedrecovery.
Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has the potential toadvance the productivity of the forest biorefinery process by rapididentification of process bioproducts, including the liquid extract and woody biomass.The potential exists so that composition identification via NIRS can beperformed as an inline process control operation. Before this technology isapplied to the forest biorefinery process, an NIR spectral database of solidwood chips and liquid extract solutions must be collected, developed, andanalyzed. Along with spectral data, physical differences of the woody biomass,including surface color, grain size, and thickness, were considered. Theeffects of viscosity, the amount of liquid scanned, and the type of solventused in solution were also investigated.
After developing the database of spectra, partial least-squares(PLS) techniques were used in combination with selected pretreatments todevelop calibration models. The calibration models were tested by scanningactual wood chips and liquid extracts removed during a laboratory-scale biorefiningprocess.
Wood chip spectra prior to pretreatment showed mostvariation within the 1000–1350 nm range.Variation in the liquid extract spectra (high water content) was evident in thesame range. Significant differences were seen when a water spectrum wassubtracted from the liquid extract spectra. Initial calibrations based on knownwoody biomass components indicate positive validation results. These outcomesconfirm the possibility for identification of extract components via NIRS,leading to the development of techniques that can be further tested inindustry.
Many limitations on current biofuel cell technologies lie inthe geometry of the test cell used to ascertain their performance. Most workhas utilized cell designs which have large distances between cathode and anode,which limits the performance of the cell due to its inherent resistivity andtransport distances. Another concern is the practicality of the device and itsuse for sensing applications. Traditional test cells are bulky and incapable ofbeing combined in such a way to produce adequate power while maintainingpractical size. Microfluidic biofuel cells have demonstrated an immensepotential for developing a solution to many of the problems involved in theproduction of commercially viable biofuel cells. In this work, we describe anovel design for the incorporation of enzymatic biocathodes and bioanodes intoa system that is capable of serial power generation in an extremely small area.This has been accomplished through the immobilization of bilirubin oxidase andlactate dehydrogenase on the cathode and anode, respectively. This isaccomplished through the controlled modification of nafion polymer with alkylammonium bromide salts, which creates an ideal hydrophobic environment ofbuffered pH and tunable pore size for the encapsulation of each enzyme. Throughthis immobilization on a microelectrode substrate, we are able to utilizephotolithographic techniques to generate an electrode design andpolydimethylsiloxane channel structures to develop a hydrodynamic flow celldesign that is capable of running ten cells in series while allowing for simpleintroduction of fresh fuel/analyte through full automation.
Oil testing presents significant challenges for automatedliquid handling and sample preparation. Pipetting performance, cross-contamination,tip washing, and production of waste material vary widely with the range ofviscosities and contaminations observed in used oil. Liquid level detection (afactor which greatly impacts pipetting performance) is further complicated bythe nonionic nature of used oil, adding to the challenges of automating usedoil liquid handling.
As a solution to these challenges, PerkinElmer hasintroduced a new high-throughput JANUS automated workstation with ultrasonic liquidlevel detection. The new workstation is based on the JANUS extended deckplatform using an eight-tip Varispan arm. It can be integrated with many FTIRs,ICP-MS, MALDI-TOF, or viscometers for “walk-away” operation, byadding a second gripper arm. The innovative application of ultrasonictechnology for liquid level detection provides significant advances whenworking with nonionic samples, and it is not impacted by individual sampleviscosities, color, or external lighting (as observed with other liquid levelsensing technologies).
Disposable tips used with the JANUs' VersaTip technologyeliminate a potential source for cross-contamination between samples, as wellas the need for repeated tip washing (as required when using fixed-tip probes).Sample diluents (such as kerosene) are maintained in a closed-loop system,recycling all but what is being used for sample dilutions. System fluids arefully recovered, resulting in a minimized waste stream and potential costsavings.
Data represented in this paper will include fully automatedsample preparation of used oil samples. Accuracy and precision data (keroseneand several known oil types), throughput examples, as well as analyticalcomparisons of samples prepared using the JANUS automated workstation will bediscussed.
The amount and size distribution of wear particles inlubricating oil of machines are indicators of the current machine condition.Monitoring the wear particles during normal operation can help to identify theneed for maintenance and more important to prevent sudden failure of themachine.
The real-time measurement system under development at theInstitute of Measurement Techniques of Hamburg University of Technology isaimed to monitor the lubricating oil of gears in windmills or the oil ofcombustion engines on engine test stands. The principle of operation is toimage a thin layer of oil and count and classify contained wear particles.Therefore, a small continuous flow of oil is pumped through a bypass connectedto the oil circuit, and directed through a thin transparent flow cell. Imagesare taken using a bright light source, a magnification lens, and small digitalvideo camera. Algorithms have been developed to process and analyze the images.They are capable of compensating for variations in background brightness, differentiatingsolid particles from nonsolid particles (e.g., air bubbles), classifyingparticles by size, and generating a histogram of the particle sizedistribution.
Using the real-time measurement system, the detection ofsignificant changes in wear particle size distribution during normal machineoperation enables the operator to prevent sudden and fatal failure. Incombination with a machine component analysis, the measurement results canyield important information about wear mechanisms.
The octane rating of gasoline is a value that indicates howmuch a fuel can be compressed before it spontaneously ignites. This spontaneousignition is also known as engine knocking, and adversely affects engineperformance. The higher the octane rating of gasoline is, the higher theresistance to knock will be. As per definition, the octane rating of isooctane,a highly branched alkane that burns smoothly, is set to 100. The rate ofn-heptane, an unbranched alkane that strongly tends to premature ignition, isset to zero. An octane rating of 85 means that the fuel has the same knockingproperties as a mixture of 85% isooctane and 15% n-heptane.
There are different octane ratings like the research octanenumber (RON) or the motor octane number (MON). Both of them are determined byrunning the fuel through a test engine (like the CFR ASTM test engine) andcomparing the obtained results with those for mixtures of isooctane andn-heptane. The different numbers result in different working conditions of thetest engine. As the preparation of the solvent mixtures significantly affectsthe accuracy of the determination of the octane rating, precise preparations ofthe solvent mixtures are of paramount importance.
This communication describes how PC-controlled automaticdosing devices allow a straightforward, reproducible, and accurate preparationof solvent mixtures. Additionally, the manual handling with hazardous solventsis minimized, and operator safety is increased.
In general, trace metals' determination demands to employ apreconcentration methodology to allow using a simpler and less expensiveanalytical technique such as flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Cloud pointextraction is a preconcentration technique based on the phases' separationphenomena which occur when a solution of a nonionic or zwitterionic surfactantis heating to a characteristic temperature. Above this temperature, a surfactant-richphase of small volume and trapping hydrophobic substances, such as metallicchelates, separates from the bulk solution.
This work presents a method for the determination of copper,cadmium, and lead from natural waters using fast sequential flame atomicabsorption spectrometry (FS FAAS) after the cloud point extraction of thesemetals. The proposed method is based on metallic ions' extraction from micellarmedia of octylphenoxypolythoxy-ethanol (Triton X-114) after complexing themetals with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-(diethylamino)-phenol [5-Br-PADAP]. Thesimultaneous extraction procedure was optimized by response surface methodologyusing a Box-Behnken design and desirability function. Enrichment factors of30.7, 22.2, and 26.6, along with detection limits (3σB) of 4.3, 0.7, and 8.3 μg L−1for Cu, Cd, and Pb, respectively, were found. The precision expressed as the relative standard deviation was 2.1, 1.7, and 4.4% (5 μg L−1, n = 8) and 1.8,1.5, and 1.5 (10 μg L−1, n = 8) for Cu, Cd, and Pb, respectively. The accuracywas evaluated through the analysis of the certified reference material NIST1643d (trace metals in water). The developed method in this study was appliedto the determination of Cu, Cd, and Pb concentrations in natural water.
Various methods for speciation of mercury currently inexistence are complex and time-consuming. EPA Method 1630 for the analysis ofmethyl mercury in water (with modifications for sediments and tissues) is amanual method that works well for very knowledgeable and experienced chemists,but it is very susceptible to a number of issues for the less experienced. Thismanual method is also very labor-intensive. We have developed a new method andautomated instrumentation, based on the same chemistry as that of EPA Method1630, but that vastly improves data quality and efficiency.
Our new method and instrumentation incorporate a number ofnovel approaches, which will be discussed in detail along with performancemeasures of quality and throughput. This system utilizes a gas-pressurizeddelivery system for fluid handling, thereby eliminating peristaltic pumps andthe “sticky” tubing used in typical automated systems. This uniqueapproach minimizes carryover contamination, and removes a common maintenanceissue. The system also incorporates a multiple trap system—cycling trapsbetween the collection, drying, and desorption stages to maximize efficiency.The trap desorption mechanism uses infrared radiation to ballistically heat thetrap material and release the mercury species extremely rapidly. This rapidrelease allows for much easier GC separation with improved peak separation.
The system has been extensively tested on a variety ofsample matrices, including a wide range of water, sediment, and tissue samples.Utilizing CVAFS, this system has significant improvements in detection limits,precision, linear range, and throughput.
Mercury is naturally present in aquatic systems in very lowconcentrations. Due to the long range atmospheric transport and deposition ofanthropogenic mercury, elevated concentrations of mercury are found even inremote freshwater system although no direct local contamination sources arepresent. It has been long recognized that mercury is one of the most hazardoustoxicants to human and the environment. To protect people and the environmentfrom the mercury, governments and regulatory agencies are introducing ever morestringent guidelines. As a result, analysts are challenged to achieve the evergreater sensitivity. The USEPA approved methods 245.7 and 1631 for thedetermination of low-level total mercury in water. Both methods are based onvapor generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CV-AFS). In this work, acomparison between performing these two EPA methods with PSA Millennium MerlinSystem is presented. The methodology, operation procedure, analyticalsensitivity, and the quality control criteria are compared in detail.
As part of the methods' update rule which was published on 12thMarch in the Federal Register, EPA method 245.7 was approved for thedetermination of mercury in wastewater. Method 245.7 (mercury in water by coldvapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry) provides better sensitivity andprecision while requiring less sample preparation than the older cold vaporatomic absorption methods (245.1, 7470, etc.). Laboratories that measure mercuryin wastewater will find that method 245.7 enables them to measure mercury tolower levels with less time and effort than ever before.
Method 245.7 was developed to satisfy the significantlylower detection limits required by recent amendments to the Clean Water Act.The method has a reporting limit of 5 parts per trillion (ppt), satisfyinganalytical requirements for most mercury water quality criteria. To put this inperspective, 12 ppt are the lowest water quality criterion for mercury outsidethe Great Lakes states.
Cold vapor atomic fluorescence and earlier cold vapor atomicabsorption methodology will be compared in terms of sample collection andpreparation, analysis time, detection limits, and quality control.
EPA 1664A utilizes a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) methodfor the analysis of oil and grease water samples. The EPA method also allowssolid phase extraction (SPE) if the laboratory satisfies the methodrequirements. New instruments have been produced to accomplish SPE by 1664A.However, those instruments are not fully automated, require intensive analysttime, have hidden costs, and are expensive.
Laboratory demand for better SPE instrumentation is growing.In response, we have created a virtually labor-free instrument. The chemistneeds to screw a patented filter cartridge onto the sample, and attach it tothe instrument, after which the chemist starts the analysis via a touch screen.Upon initialization, the instrument's balance will calibrate itself and storethe data. After calibration is complete, the instrument will tare out thesolute recovery container while methanol is applied to the filter. Once thecomputer-controlled filter activation cycle is complete, the methanol is purgedand the sample is extracted. Hexane will then rinse the bottle and release thesolute from the filter. The collected solute (extract) is robotically moved toan intrinsically safe heating area to evaporate the hexane. After evaporation,the extract moves to a desiccator and equilibrates. Again, the computercontrols the equilibration cycle, after which the extract is weighed as per themethod. Results are then calculated, stored internally, and can be exported toa printer, network, or LIM. Analysis of 40 water samples a day is possible.
Understanding how drugs interact with cells is ongoingresearch that attracts a significant attention. However, the use of cells forthis purpose is not always practical; thus, gemini surfactants can be used tohelp us understand the drug-cell interaction at a deeper level because thesesurfactants can form aggregates (i.e., vesicles) that mimic the cell membranesabove a certain concentration called critical aggregation concentration (CAC).Gemini surfactants are a new class of surfactants that are made up of twomonomeric surfactants connected to each other by a spacer group. In the presentresearch, two novel gemini surfactants (1,1′-Didodecyl-1,1′-but-2-yne-1,4-diyl-bis-pyrrolidiniumdibromide (I-12) and1,1′-Ditetradecyl-1,1′-but-2-yne-1,4-diyl-bis-pyrrolidinium dibromide (I-14))as well as their counterpart conventional monomeric surfactants werecharacterized and utilized as pseudostationary phases in capillaryelectrophoresis (CE) to test how compounds with different chemical propertiessuch as hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond forming capacity interact with thevesicles. More than 30 benzene derivatives with varying differences in hydrogenbond formation properties were used as standard analytes to test the separationpower of aforementioned novel surfactants. To optimize the CE separation conditions,several parameters such as surfactant and buffer concentrations, temperature,and separation were systematically studied. The surfactant type and temperaturewere found to have a significant effect on the separation. In addition, solute pseudostationaryphase interactions were also examined by determining Gibbs free energy,enthalpy, and entropy values.
Lignin is the second most abundant organic substance onearth, after cellulose, and plays a central role in the natural ecologicalcycle of plants. The lignin macromolecule is comprised of a number of ether-and carbon-linked methoxyphenols. Due to the complexity of the lignin sample,capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) seems to be an idealtechnique for the analysis of charged and uncharged components of lignin.Thirty-five lignin standards were used to investigate the optimization of CE-MSconditions. The optimized CZE-ESI-MS conditions were mobile phase containing20 mM ammonium carbonate, pH 9.5; sheath liquid containing 80/20 MeOH/H2Odelivered at 5 μL/min; spray chamber set to drying gas flow of 5 mL/min,nebulizer pressure of 5 psi, and drying gas temperature of 150°C.Further studies are underway to analyze lignin via micellar electrokineticchromatography (MEKC) coupled to MS, using molecular micelles. After optimizingthe peak capacity of lignin standards, the method will be applied for theidentification of lignin in sour orange tree.
Microfluidics and nanofluidics offer potential advantages inperformance, reagent consumption, and size for many applications. However,their potential has seldom been realized, and the impact of miniaturizationtechnologies remains largely a future vision. We will describe a newmicrofluidic and nanofluidic platform developed at MBI, Apollo 100, which automatesfluorescent DNA sequencing sample preparation by integrating nanoliter scalecycle sequencing and bead-based cleanup on-chip.
The Apollo 100 is based upon our patented NanoBioProcessortechnology that creates on-chip MOV minivalves, pumps, and routers with simplecontrol of their operation using full-scale pneumatics. The Apollo 100 usesfull-scale commercial robotics to load and unload NanoBioProcessor microchips.The user will input standard microtiter plates with DNA templates and receiveback ready-to-inject microtiter plates with samples ready for capillary arrayelectrophoresis analysis, saving reagent and personnel costs.
At the heart of the system, a microchip device performsmultichannel nanoscale cycle sequencing reactions and cleanup. The microchipuses the on-chip MOV valves, pumps, and routers to mix samples and reagents,and to move beads, reagents, and wash solutions. The NanoBioProcessor microchipand the robot are controlled by MBI's DevLink software. Results of integratednanoscale cycle sequencing and cleanup with read lengths over 1000 bases willbe presented.
The future applications of the Apollo system in thedevelopment of genomic, biodefense, forensic, and other systems will bediscussed as well as how on-chip valves, pumps, and routers can enable manynext-generation, modular, microfluidic devices for analysis of liquids. Theoverall strategies, designs, and results will be presented to illustrate how toharness the power of microfluidics to create widely applicable modular samplepreparation and platforms for both portable and laboratory analyses.
Automated sample management has long been a realization forthe liquid handling sector. Only until recent improvements in the technology ofpowder aspiration and deposition has the feasibility of powder samplemanagement been a realization.
The system under development will push the boundaries of drypowder automated sample handling by incorporating a multiparameter samplingautomation process. A robotic XYZ platform with dual Z drives will select from8 precalibrated powder pipettes, with the secondary Z drive moving samplesabout the internal robotic plane. The application requires the system to selecta sample amid a library of 96-well sample boxes. The sorting will beaccomplished via a carousel and bar code reading system. As some vials havepress on caps and others have screw caps, the XYZ robot will move the selectedsamples to the correct zone within the robot plane to automatically decap andcap the vials. A balance incorporated into the same robotic plane will tare andweight-check each vial for the accuracy of the deposited dry powder.
The project presentation will prove the feasibility of drypowder automated sample handing for this and other prospective projects. Adetailed accounting of the precision and accuracy of the sample handling datawill be presented along with project highlights and an operational overview.
Intestinal ischaemia is a serious complication of manysurgical procedures. We have used online rapid sampling microdialysis (rsMD) todetect ischemia in the human bowel. Our approach has been to place the probe inthe bowel wall and analyze the dialysate online.
We have developed an online rsMD technique for monitoringmetabolites in the human bowel during gastrointestinal surgery. This analyzes the dialysate glucose and lactate electrochemically at high time resolution (typically30 seconds). The system was adapted from the previous biosensor system used tomonitor neurochemicals in the human brain during surgery [23]. The methodconsists of a flow injection analysis (FIA) system coupled to an enzyme-basedamperometric detector.
Dialysate levels in the human bowel stabilized within 12minutes of probe implantation, for glucose (2.77 ± 0.57 mM, n = 7) and lactate(0.77 ± 0.17 mM, n = 7). After arterial resection glucose showed a small decrease at10 minutes (−0.261 ± 0.085 mM, P = .0175, n = 7), recover to preresectionvalues by 17 minutes to then decrease dramatically to −1.89 ± 0.39 mM (P = .0135, n = 6). Lactate levels arose in a constant manner to reach the value of 1.47 ± 0.53 mM (P = .0331, n = 7). Results from anastomosis microdialysis monitoring in animal models will be compared with the human data.
EcoSEC, a new sophisticated GPC/SEC instrument, was developedfor semimicro and high-throughput SEC measurements. The equipment consists ofan online degasser, autosampler, temperature-controlled pumping system, columnoven, refractive-index (RI) detector, and optional UV detector. All units mount in a chassis and are computer-controlled.
We evaluated the fundamental characteristics of this newGPC/SEC equipment, and the results will be reported. We investigated theprecision and the reproducibility of flow rate, the precision of temperaturecontrol in the pumping unit, column oven and RI detector, the baselinestability against external temperature change, the sensitivity of the RIdetector, and other system characteristics. Furthermore, the precision and thereproducibility of molecular mass and molecular mass distribution wereevaluated using semimicro TSK-GEL SuperMultipore columns and PStQuickpolystyrene calibration markers.
The results demonstrate that the new GPC/SEC instrument wassuitable for high-throughput SEC as well as for semimicro SEC applications.Moreover, the instrument, in combination with TSK-GEL SuperMultiporeHZ seriescolumns and PStQuick calibration standards, showed a high level of robustnessin terms of site-to-site reproducibility of molecular mass measurement. TheEcoSEC instrument, equipped with a TSKgel SuperMultiporeHZ-H column, wasapplied to the high-throughput analysis of several important industrial polymersamples.
Size-based separation methods are universally accepted forpolymer mixtures, particularly when analytes differ greatly in size. However,this technique lacks selectivity when analytes have similar molecular weights.Therefore, it is advantageous to develop a chemically based separation methodto allow improved selectivity for the analyte of interest by exploiting thechemical differences of the analytes.
Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated the use ofcapillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber columns for the reversed-phase (RP)separation of proteins. Previously, C-CP fiber columns have been used toseparate a suite of 4 proteins in less than 4 minutes at a flow rate of 7 mL/min [24]. The C-CP fiber format facilitates separations based on chemical interactions without contributions from size exclusion phenomena; therefore it was hypothesized that this technique could be adapted to separations involvingsynthetic macromolecules (i.e., polymers). Due to the structural and syntheticdifferences between proteins and polymers, it is necessary to evaluate thechromatographic performance of the C-CP fiber columns in conjunction withpolymers.
Our laboratory has separated two water-soluble polymers (poly(4-vinylpyridinehydrochloride) and glycolic acid ethoxylate 4-nonylphenyl ether) which couldnot be separated by SEC. The initial separation was done under gradientconditions at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. After an evaluation of varyingseparation conditions, an optimum separation was achieved using water andacetonitrile (ACN) both with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a 20% gradientand a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
As laboratories start to consider replacing theirpaper-based processes with an electronic laboratory notebook, they are oftensurprised at how many paper forms their organization actually uses. In manycases, they discover that there are dozens of forms with multiple pages andmultiple variations that are widely distributed throughout the enterprise.
Converting every single variation of every paper form to anelectronic document can appear to be a daunting task.
Our presentation will help organizations manage theirprocess of moving away from paper by providing guidelines and insight intodetermining which processes should be a priority for conversion,identifying the levels of automation that can be incorporated into ELN forms,identifying points of integration between the ELN and existing systems,different processes for converting from paper.			
determining which processes should be a priority for conversion,
identifying the levels of automation that can be incorporated into ELN forms,
identifying points of integration between the ELN and existing systems,
different processes for converting from paper.
Organizations will learn how to turn the conversion processinto an opportunity to assess the forms they are using, consolidate forms thatshare common characteristics and formats, and prioritize forms within theconversion process.
With this information, they will be better prepared tolaunch an ELN project that will introduce maximum benefits with minimal impacton the workplace both during the transition process and once the new system isin place.
Introducing a standardized enterprise-wide solution canlower the total cost of ownership (TCO) for laboratory information management systems(LIMSs). Electronic notebooks (ELNs) can improve the personal productivity ofanalysts working in research and quality-control laboratories. Data managementand data warehouse systems provide ready access to information, and can helpreduce search time and duplication of effort by knowledge workers. Providingintegrated analytical tool kits and training for scientists can reduce some ofthe chaos, support costs for research, and provide new opportunities forsharing and building on innovative ideas.
We intuitively know that there is value in implementingthese laboratory informatics solutions. These solutions help companies in allindustries to produce better products with shorter development cycle times andat lower cost. However, business decisions to acquire them have to be based onthe review of a business case including a cost justification.
This presentation will present ideas and a model forcalculating the benefits for laboratory informatics solutions. The model willinclude rules of thumb based on industry experience for projecting productivityimprovements resulting from the introduction of technology to replace functionstypically performed manually like data entry, data access, or compilation ofreports. However, projections of productivity improvement are only part of thestory. These need to be translated into actual benefits that are measurable bythe corporation in terms of speed, productivity, or cost. The author willdescribe strategies for accomplishing this. These will be supported byexamples.
This will be a valuable presentation for anyone involved inlooking at the impact of the introduction of laboratory informatics technology,whether developing a business case or looking at benefits being captured bysystems that have been implemented.
Most electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) have beendesigned to accommodate R&D requirements, where variety and flexibility arethe name of the game.
For laboratories that are performing routine analyses on aregular and ongoing basis, there is a need for an ELN that does much more thansimply recording results and observations. In this environment, there is anopportunity for the ELN to become a proactive component controlling theanalytical process and ensuring that every aspect of an SOP is being fulfilled.
Creating an ELN for this environment requires looking beyondthe basics and considering all of the factors that are part of ensuringconformance to an SOP. These factors include confirming analysts'qualifications, completing instrument calibrations, confirming proper use ofreagents, solutions and chemicals, automating calculations and limit checks, aswell as ensuring step-by-step adherence to the SOP process.
Of course all of these factors have to be considered rightat the bench level, as the analysis is taking place.
Our presentation will show how starting out with these requirementsin mind results in an electronic laboratory notebook that addresses each ofthese factors, in real time, ensuring that every routine procedure fulfills allaspects of SOP requirements.
In today's laboratory, it is common to be involved in manyaspects of the physical/chemical analysis of materials. Having the ability tokeep track of all of these disparate data can be a major challenge whether weare generating all of the data ourselves or they are coming from severaldepartments. In addition, with all of these different data, the possibility ofmisplacing something is much higher than we would like to admit. This talk willlook at a tool that can be used to manage, analyze, annotate, and createreports from data sources as diverse as TGA, DSC, XRPD, optical spectroscopy,chromatography, Mass Spec, NMR, chemical structures, and metadata. Having allof the data available to review and share across an organization improves thedecision-making process and allows great science to be achieved.
A microfluidic device has been developed that combinescontinuous plug generation, reagent mixing, online fluorescent derivatization,and plug fusion to an aqueous stream for high-efficiency capillary electrophoresis(CE) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection of amino acids (AAs).Hydrophobic and hydrophilic patterned channels were employed to assist inaqueous phase breakup at a T-junction, interplug chemical isolation, and plugfusion at a virtual wall. Differential glass etching was also employed togenerate high fluidic resistance electrophoresis channels with 8.5 μm depth andlow-resistance droplet breakup and mixing channels with 80 μm depth. The formerenabled high-efficiency electrophoresis, while the latter was useful forgenerating plugs with volumes and temporal intervals ranging between 7.8–28.2 nL and 0.6–10 seconds,respectively. Online fluorescent conjugation of amino acids was performed inplugs using multiple derivatization chemistries including fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC) and naphthalene 2,3,dicarboxylaldehyde (NDA). Reagentswere combined laminarly immediately prior to plug breakup at a T-junction.Turbulent mixing of NDA, CN-, and AAs was performed in plugs for 1-2 minutes priorto droplet fusion. Kinetics of the fluorogenic NDA reaction were recorded overthe length of the reaction channel, and were found to reach completion at ~65seconds after initial mixing. Plug fusion into a continuous flow stream wasdemonstrated using a parallel current fusion technique. Following fusion,capillary electrophoresis of fluorescein, rhodamine 110, FITC-AA, and NDA-AAconjugates was performed with high efficiencies.
A digital microfluidic device was applied to a variety ofenzymatic analyses. The digital approach to microfluidics manipulates samplesand reagents in the form of discrete droplets, as opposed to the streams offluid used in channel microfluidics. This approach is more easily reconfiguredthan a channel device, and the flexibility of these devices makes them suitablefor a wide variety of applications. Alkaline phosphatase was chosen as a modelenzyme, and used to convert fluorescein diphosphate into fluorescein. Dropletsof alkaline phosphatase and fluorescein diphosphate were merged and mixed onthe device, resulting in a 140 nL stopped-flow reaction chamber in which thefluorescent product was detected by a fluorescence plate reader. Substratequantitation was achieved with a linear range of 2 orders of magnitude and adetection limit of approximately 7.0 × 10−20 mol. Addition of asmall amount of a nonionic surfactant to the reaction buffer was shown toreduce the adsorption of enzyme to the device surface and extend the lifetimeof the device without affecting the enzyme activity. Analyses of the enzymekinetics and the effects of inhibition with inorganic phosphate were performed,and Km and kcat values of 1.35 μM and 120 s−1 agreed with those obtained in a conventional 384-well plate under the sameconditions (1.85 μM and 155 s−1). A multiplexed device was alsodeveloped to perform 6 simultaneous determinations in an effort to reduceanalysis times and variation among replicates. It was concluded that thedigital microfluidic format is able to perform detailed and reproducible assaysof substrate concentrations and enzyme activity in much smaller reactionvolumes and with higher sensitivity than conventional methods.
Temporal resolution is a key figure of merit for in vivoexperiments. With microdialysis sampling, temporal resolution is primarilylimited by the band broadening of sample plugs as they flow from the sampling probeto the analysis system due to parabolic flow and diffusion. This problem isespecially evident when sampling flow rate is low (10–300 nL/min). Tosolve this problem, a segmented flow system was developed, in which the aqueoussample stream emerging from a microdialysis probe was converted to separatedroplets, and transported in an immiscible oil phase, for example, perfluorodecalin.A T-junction on a PDMS-based chip was used for droplet generation. Relationsbetween flow rate, droplet volume, and time interval were studied, which werecompared with an existing model. To test the ability of this system to improvetemporal resolution, a homemade microdialysis probe was coupled to the chip,and fluorescein was sampled at a flow rate of 200 nL/min. After generation,droplets were transferred to a capillary rendered hydrophobic by derivatizationwith octadecyltrichlorosilane. Droplets were detected by laser-induced fluorescence(LIF) both immediately after droplets were formed and at approximately 40 cmdownstream. As fluorescein concentration was changed, the response time for bothon-chip and on-capillary detection processes was recorded and the resultingplots showed that they were exactly the same. In comparison, for continuousflow, deterioration in temporal resolution was observed at downstream. Severaloptimizations in experimental condition were conducted to further shortenresponse time. Finally, this system was applied to detect glucose concentrationchange in rat brain. A triple-branch inlet channel was used this time to mixboth enzyme and dye with glucose sample stream before droplets were formed. Reactionsbetween glucose and derivatizing reagents took place within droplets as theyflowed from the T-junction to the detection window on the collection capillary.
Pharmaceutical granules pose new QA/QC challenges to theanalytical laboratory because their formulation is often not as well understoodas the average pressed tablet. Size and weight, in combination with dosage,often suffice to monitor quality, but are not very helpful for troubleshootingperformance issues. In this presentation, we discuss two approaches to measureboth chemistry and morphology in pharmaceutical granule formulations orpregranulation samples. First, we describe a method for the simultaneousmeasurement of size, shape, and chemical composition of hundreds of granulesusing near infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI). Tens to hundreds of granules arespread in the field of view (FOV) for data acquisition, and the chemistry ofeach granule is acquired, with a spatial resolution depending on the selectedFOV. Chemometrics analysis is performed on the dataset to generate contrastrelevant to the chemistry of the samples, and the morphology is investigatedwith respect to the chemistry. The second approach described is primarily amorphological measurement performed with an automated microscope equipped witha single-point Raman spectrometer. With this instrument, the morphologicalfeatures of hundreds of thousands of granules are measured and the chemicalinformation (Raman spectrum) is automatically acquired only from discretegranules selected on the basis of their morphology. This presentation focuseson results showing how these techniques may be used for root-cause analysis ofdissolution failure and blend heterogeneity. They indicate that the performance ofthe unit dose shows dependency on the different chemistries and morphologies ofindividual granules rather than on the average of all granules in a batch.
The use of pattern recognition algorithms in digital imageprocessing is not a new phenomenon. Research and development of algorithms forpattern recognition have been going on for many years, driven initially byapplications in the intelligence community for analysis of reconnaissanceimagery. Later on, the techniques were successfully applied to other fields,the most prominent being medical imaging. However, in most cases the algorithmswere developed for looking at static images, where an entire image isbeing searched to try to locate one particular object within it.
This paper will discuss applying the principles of patternrecognition in a new way, to characterize particles in a moving fluid in“real time,” with the objective being the determination of theconcentration of multiple different particle types in a heterogeneous solution.This technique has the potential to greatly advance the sensitivity ofmonitoring systems in a process environment, by providing much more informationon the state of the process in real time. The availability of this informationwill permit a much tighter “feedback loop” for quality monitoring,and therefore can yield significant cost savings by being able to proactively adjust process variables.
A brief overview of pattern recognition theory will befollowed by a discussion of how these well-developed techniques can be appliedto monitor particle concentrations for multiple particle types within aheterogeneous fluid. A specific application will be detailed showing resultsobtained, and suggestions will be made as to other areas where this techniquemay be applied.
Polymer ChAR has developed a fully automatedcross-fractionation apparatus in a benchtop instrument, called CFC. It isintended to measure the interdependence between molecular weight distributionand chemical composition distribution in polyolefins in a single experiment,under full computer control. The infrared detector is used to obtain the MWD ofeach fraction and the 3D surface plot in temperature, and Log Mw axis isgenerated with these results. Also other 2D plots are offered like the MWDprofile with composition dependence as well as the composition profile withmolar mass dependence for the whole sample.
CFC is capable of analyzing up to 5 consecutive samplesautomatically, and incorporates a subambient option down to −20°C. Two samplesa day can be analyzed at standard conditions (see Figure 13).
The virtual instrumentation software provides instrumentcontrol and monitoring of the whole process and signals generated. The systemincludes remote control access for easy diagnosis and software upgrades.
The physical and chemical performances of most polymericmaterials gradually degrade due to external effects such as heating,photoradiation, oxidative atmosphere, and mechanical stress. During thedegradation process, not only the decomposed compounds formed from the samplebut also the structural alternation of the samples has been important target toanalyze. By getting this information, it would be possible to prepare theadvanced materials by modifying their molecular structures and/or selectingappropriate additives. For these analyses, a new analytical method has to bedeveloped.
A new analytical instrument using an online ultraviolet (UV)radiator combined with the multifunctional microfurnace pyrolyzer (double-shotpyrolyzer, Frontier Lab) with capillary column GC/MS will be described. A UVbeam was spotted on a small amount of polymer sample set in the pyrolyzerthrough an optical fiber cable. The evolved gas from the irradiated polymersample was analyzed by GC online, and then the residual polymer sample waspyrolyzed in the pyrolyzer to give a specific pyrogram. Based on bothinformation sets obtained, the deterioration mechanism of the polymericmaterial during irradiation and the effect of additives such as photostabilizerand UV-absorber can be evaluated using sub-milli-gram order of polymer samplewith relatively short test period compared with that by conventional techniquesuch as a weather meter. Here the basic performance of this system was examinedusing typical polymer materials such as polystyrene, polypropylene andpolycarbonate. These examples clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the onlineUV/pyrolysis-GC/MS system when characterizing the photo/thermal/oxidative-degradationof polymers.
Formulation studies of new products involved in the finechemicals or specialty chemicals fields have motivated our company to design anoverhead stirrer. This unique stirring module has 8 reactors, typically 20 or30 mL glass vials, in which 8 rotating blades allow perfect mixing of thedifferent products. It has several advantages compared to traditional vortexersor magnetic stirrers, especially when high or increasing viscosities areinvolved in a chemical reaction process as the overhead stirrer increases theturbulence and keeps the contents moving. Each reactor can be filled throughcross-slitted septum by our special probes or disposable tips, while theWinLISSY software digitally controls the mixing. The pipetting channel isintegral to the mixer ensuring quick and efficient mixing of reagents which aredelivered to the heart of the reaction. A temperature-controlled carrier isavailable for heating of the reactions and a reflux option fits neatly on top.
Horiba has developed and is selling an in situ monitor forcombustion measurement applications. The INM-700 simultaneously measures NOxand O2 using a novel zirconium oxide detector. The in situ probe geometryrequires little of the setup time for, sample conditioning, and maintenance that is requiredfor systems employing extractive sampling, thus offering reduced initial costand cost of ownership. This paper outlines the successful testing of a newapproach for in situ, simultaneous NOx and O2 analysis. The sensor technologydescribed was demonstrated for a coal-fired power plant application.
Accurately measuring the mercury content of liquidhydrocarbons, such as naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, light oils, crude oils, andpetroleum condensates, can be a very daunting task. Often the mercuryconcentrations of hydrocarbon samples can be in the low to subpart per billionrange, while the diversity and complexity of these samples have few rivals.Conventional analysis techniques involve a hazardous and tedious acidicdigestion that consumes several hours of the analysts' laboratory time, andhave been known to produce over half of the errors generated during any sampleanalysis. One known technique for eliminating the digestion process for mercuryanalysis is the use of high-temperature combustion to decompose the sample intoa gaseous state. This thermal decomposition of the sample, accompanied by goldamalgamation and atomic spectroscopy, is commonly referred to as “directmercury analysis.” In recent years, this technique has commonly been usedfor environmental samples; however Nippon Instruments Corporation has expertlyadapted it to the analysis of liquid hydrocarbons in the Model PE-1000 MercuryAnalyzer.
In this presentation, data will be provided to illustratethe high-quality results obtained through the use of Model PE-1000. Thecapabilities of this analyzer will be discussed in detail.
The thermal desorption technique is commonly known to beapplied to the monitoring of volatile organic pollutants in air; the numerousadvantages make it a successful alternative to the solvent extractiontechnique. The recent improvements in the TD instrumentation extendthe use of this technique to the analysis of compounds with a wider boiling pointrange.
This paper shows the application of a thermal desorber tothe environmental monitoring of both VOCs (volatile organic compounds) andSVOCs (semivolatile organic compounds). An automatic leak check ensures thecomplete integrity of each sample.
The typical target compounds are BTEX, chlorinatedhydrocarbons, pesticides, PAH, phenols, and phtalates. Thermal desorption is agood alternative to conventional extraction procedures, and allows thereduction of analysis times without loss of the precision.
There are several demands and requirements imposed on chemistsperforming volatile organic analysis in today's environmental laboratory. Thefirst and most important fact is that the analysis must be performed incompliance with USEPA methodologies. Next, there is a continued trend toachieve lower levels of detection. As the result of required low detectionlevels, water management and carryover reduction have become more of a concern.
This paper will present the optimum purge and trap systemparameters used to generate method 8260B data. The conditions utilized willprovide the necessary sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy compliant with themethod. In particular, the revolutionary advancement used to virtuallyeliminate carryover below the maximum contaminate level will be highlighted.Other technological advancements in a purge and trap system will also bedemonstrated. Analytical results including calibration factors, methoddetection limits, and reproducibility data in both water and soil matrices willbe shown.
Parabens are a group of chemicals used as preservatives inthe cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries for their bactericidal andfungicidal properties. Their efficacy as preservatives, in combination withtheir low cost and their long history of safe use, probably explains theirwidespread use.
However, a considerable interest in toxic effects of acontinuous exposition to low levels of these compounds has arisen after therecent discovery of parabens in tissue samples from human breast tumors. Aweak estrogenic activity for some parabens has been demonstrated by in vivo andin vitro tests.
Urban wastewaterconstitutes one of the main environmental sources of these species in the biosphere;therefore, it must be the first compartment to be investigated in order to knowthe levels of parabens and understand their fate in the aquatic media.
Available methods for the determination of parabens inwastewater consist of a solid phase extraction (SPE) as the concentrationtechnique, followed by a liquid (LC) or gas chromatographic (GC) analysis withmass spectrometry detection.
A new method based on solid phase microextraction-gaschromatography-flame ionization detection (SPME-GC-FID) can be proposed as ascreening tool to monitor paraben presence in the environment and/or food. Thenew Thermo TriPlus Autosampler enabled a completely automated development ofthe SPME method. A CW/DVB fiber was chosen as the best extracting coating, anda good chromatographic separation was achieved in only 23 minutes.
The proposed method is fast, economic, and suitable for thelarge number of samples in routine analysis.
Eutrophication, a detrimental increase in an ecosystem'smicrobial population due to an influx of nutrients, is a serious concern innatural water environments. The homeostatic balance of these ecological systemsdepends upon the presence of organic phosphates in lakes, streams, and ponds.Controlling these compounds requires increasingly accurate and consistentdetection over smaller and smaller concentrations.
Widely used methodologies for phosphorus analysis, such asUSEPA Method 365.4, require a digestion step using a mercury catalyst toconvert inorganic phosphates and polyphosphates into measurable orthophosphate.These Kjeldahl-style methodologies of sample preparation demand strict postdigestionwaste management to prevent exposure to dangerous mercury compounds. Moreover,these methods often limit the analyst to sample measurements of 10 ppb andhigher. Increased environmental awareness of the eutrophic effects ofphosphorus and the toxic effects of mercury exposure has driven state and localagencies to seek analytical methods that can detect phosphorus at low levelswithout incurring the risk and expense associated with hazardous mercurydigestions.
An automated continuous flow analysis method for phosphorusdetection at low ppb levels will be presented. This alternative methodologywill utilize manual persulfate digestions for sample preparation and injectedsegmented flow analysis (iSFA). Calibration data, linear range measurements,method detection limits (MDLs), and representative sample analyses will bereported.
With about 5% of the population between the ages of 15 and64 (~200 million people) using illicit drugs and thousands of drug intoxicationsper year in the western world alone, fast screening methods for drugs andpharmaceuticals are necessary for the detection of xenobiotics in forensicintoxication cases. Identi fication of these drugs in biological fluids iscurrently performed by a variety of analytical techniques including immunoassaytests, available only for a small number of substance classes, orchromatographic techniques such as GC/MS and LC/UV. Although these techniquesare well established and widely used, they suffer from many limitations,including laborious and time-consuming derivatization steps for the analysis ofnonvolatile and polar drugs by GC/MS. LC is ideally suited for polar compoundsbut UV detection lacks the necessary specificity and methods require long runtimesto minimize the potential for coelution. In addition, sensitivity of LC/UV islimited but newer drugs are used at lower therapeutic concentrations.
In recent years, LC/MS/MS has been increasingly used fortoxicological screening applications with mass spectral library searching toconfirm detected drugs.
A highly specific and sensitive screening and confirmatoryLC/MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous analysis of 300 compoundsrelevant in forensic toxicology, such as drugs of abuse, pharmaceuticals, and theirmetabolites using a QTRAP LC/MS/MS system. The method is built into Cliquid Drug Screen and Quant software for routine forensic toxicology. The newsoftware allows screening for unknown drugs in urine and blood samples withpreconfigured methods and automatic processing and reporting. Identification is provided using a comprehensive library of MS/MS spectra.
Methamphetamine is a powerfully addictive psychostimulantdrug that stimulates the central nervous system. The drug illegally circulatedin Japan is generally a form of white crystals, so-called “ice,” andthe purity is mostly very high. However, in recent years, we encountermethamphetamine seizures mixed with dimethyl sulfone, a common cutting agent.In this study, we present a method for simultaneous determination ofmethamphetamine and dimethyl sulfone in methamphetamine seizures by fast gaschromatography. A hundred milligrams of ground samples (seized crystals or powders)were weighed and dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water. A 0.5 mL portion of thesolution was added to 0.2 mL of 40% potassium carbonate solution and extractedwith dichloromethane containing diphenylmethane as an internal standard. Aftercentrifugation, a portion of the extracts was subjected to gas chromatographywith a flame ionization detector on a DB-17 capillary column (0.1 mm i.d. × 10 m, film thickness of 0.1 μm). The use of a narrow-bore column offered fast andcomplete separation of 3 substances within 2 minutes. Methamphetamine wascompletely recovered from sample solutions although the recovery of dimethylsulfone was 46%. The method was linear over the range investigated (0.02–2.4 mg/mL, which isequivalent to 1–120% in powderedsamples). Limits of detection were estimated to be at 0.003 mg/mL formethamphetamine and 0.01 mg/mL for dimethyl sulfone. The method wassubsequently applied to the analysis of methamphetamine seizures, and it wasfound that the contents of dimethyl sulfone ranged from 0% to 90%.
Worldwide, cocaine is the most widely abused recreationaldrug, and thus it is commonly encountered in many forensic and clinicaltoxicology cases. Cocaine (C) is extensively metabolized forming themetabolites benzoylecgonine (BZE), ecgonine methyl ester (EME), and ecgonine(E). Additionally, when cocaine is coingested with ethanol, cocaethylene (CE)is produced.
This automated method is unique in that it interfaces theSpark Holland Symbiosis to the Applied BioSystems 4000 Qtrap so that these twoinstruments function as a single unified system. A positive ion electrospraysolid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry(SPE-LC-MS-MS) method was developed for the analysis of C, BZE, CE, EME, and Ein urine and whole blood. The deuterated analogues of these analytes were usedas internal standards.
In developing this method, ten different solid phasecartridges were evaluated to determine the optimal SPE material for theextraction of all analytes from urine and whole blood. The results demonstratethat Hysphere MM anion cartridge extracted all five analytes and was used forthe validation of the method in both urine and whole blood. The GeminiC6-Phenyl was found to be optimal for all compounds studied. Likewise, severalmobile phase combinations were evaluated, but the one that was optimal was agradient from 100% of 0.1% formic acid in water to 90% of 0.1% formic acid inacetonitrile with a run time of 10 minutes. Two independent MS/MS transitionswere monitored for each analyte. The precursor's m/z product m/z values selected and monitored for all the analytes. The validation demonstrates that C, BZE, and CE werelinear within 4–1000 ng/mL, whileEME and E were linear within 10–1000 ng/mL inurine. Likewise, C, BZE, CE, and EME were linear within 4–500 ng/mL, whileE was linear within 10–500 ng/mL inblood. In this study, no known interferences were observed.
DEET is the active substance used in many insect repellents.It was designed for direct application to human skin to repel insects by the USArmy in 1946. It repels pests such as mosquitoes, sand flies, gnats, chiggers,ticks, deer flies, and fleas. In 1957, DEET was registered for use by thegeneral public. Annually, one third of USA population is estimated to useproducts containing DEET.
We identified several major metabolites of DEET in humanurine samples. Additionally, we have developed a sensitive, robust, andaccurate analytical method for quantifying DEET metabolites in human urine. Ourmethod uses an enzyme digestion and a simple solid phase extraction followedby a highly selective analysis with high-performance liquid chromatographyhigh-resolution tandem mass spectrometry using stable isotope-labeledstandards. The mass spectrometer was operated using atmospheric pressurechemical ionization in the multiple reaction monitoring mode.
The limits of detection (LOD) of our method were between 11 pg/mL and 228 pg/mL, and coefficients of variation were lower than 18%. Theextraction efficiency of the SPE method ranged from 78 to 112% for thedifferent analytes. Calibration plots exhibited linearity over the range from0.25 to 250 ng/mL. The use of the BETASYL Phenyl-Hexyl and BETASIL C18 columnallowed us to have a good chromatographic resolution which increased theselectivity and sensitivity of the method. The use of stable isotope analoguesas internal standards for most of these metabolites allows for the highestdegree of accuracy and precision.
Increasing sensitivity in the field of liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LCMS) is an ongoing process. Indeed, special applicationssuch as biomarker discovery or metabolomics studies involve complex biologicalmatrices that require excellent sensitivity (femtomole range), enhanced massaccuracy, and superior resolution. Optimizing the quality of mobile phasesolvents can contribute to improving the chromatographic or mass spectrometricproperties of the analyte. ThermoFisher Global Chemicals has developed a newsolvent grade that meets the stringent purity requirements of LCMS byaddressing the need for minimal organic contamination, minimal metal massadduct formation, and high ionization efficiency. Comparative chromatographicdata for pure solvents and neat chemicals (TFA and FA) were collected using asingle-quadrupole mass spectrometer and a ThermoFisher LTQ -FT hybrid linearion trap MS system. Our results will demonstrate that Optima LC/MS acetonitrile(A955), water (W6), and methanol (A456) have a low mass-to-noise level for bothpositive and negative modes in TIC, exceptionally low metal ion content whichcan form MS adducts that interfere with MS interpretation, and very low LC-UVbackground using diode array detector.
The advent of high-throughput synthesis and purification hascreated a need for more efficient ways to do reaction scouting, routedevelopment, and product profiling. Microflow HPLC, defined as havingchromatographic columns in the 0.3–0.5 mm range andflow rates in the 2–60 μL/min range,can significantly shorten the HPLC analysis time attributable to itscharacteristic rapid gradient mixing and fast column re-equilibration.Additionally, the substantial reduction in solvent usage and waste generationcan contribute to the increasingly important “green chemistry”effort. Using a novel microflow HPLC system, we have developed a robustshort-cycle time (<2 minutes) rapid gradient method for the analysis ofcrude synthesis products in discovery chemistry labs. Chromatographic columnsof different phases, particle sizes, and dimensions are evaluated on a set ofcompounds covering a wide range of lipophilicity. The capability of themicroflow HPLC method to deal with real-world “dirty” samples iscritically investigated. The results compare favorably to those obtained usinga conventional 4.6 mm column rapid gradient HPLC system. The benefits andissues of using a microflow HPLC in an open-access medicinal chemistryenvironment will be discussed.
Current trends in HPLC system development have embracedhigher pressures, higher temperatures, and lower flow rates to increaseanalytical throughput and separation efficiency. By combining recent advancesin microscale fluid delivery, small particle (<3 μm) stationary phases,high-temperature separations, and chip-based UV absorbance detection with afully integrated microflow gradient HPLC system, the overall performance has beenoptimized for short-cycle times, high resolution, and good detectionsensitivity.
It is widely accepted that microflow HPLC offers a number ofadvantages over conventional analytical HPLC. At low flow rates (<50 μL/min),the amount of time required to thoroughly mix mobile phases and re-equilibratethe column is dramatically reduced. This in turn results in a reduction ininjection-to-injection cycle times.
While sub 2 μm particle stationary phases offer highseparation efficiency (>150,000 N/m), at ambient temperatures, columnpressure becomes a limiting factor. In order to achieve high efficiency withouthaving to design system components to withstand ultrahigh pressures, we use sub3 μm particle columns at moderately high (>60°C) temperatures. Inthis way separation efficiency is improved with only modest increases in systempressures.
One critical aspect of system performance is the opticaldetection system. Clearly, reducing the flow cell's dimensions preserveschromatographic resolution. However, this change in the flow cell design isunavoidably accompanied by a reduction in light transmission which increasesshort-term noise. This reduction in signal-to-noise ratio can compromise thesystem's performance. To overcome this limitation, optical fibers andchip-based technology have been employed.
Results of our tests using a diverse set of pharmaceuticalapplications relevant to both drug discovery and drug development indicate thatthe system design optimization enables separation efficiencies approaching thoseof UHPLC systems without its requisite ultrahigh pressures. A selection ofthese results will be presented to illustrate overall system performance.
Large numbers of compounds are generated by synthesisstrategies based on combinatorial chemistry, with the consequent increase inthe size of compound libraries. This has resulted in a critical demand forhigh-throughput analytical techniques, both qualitative and quantitative, thatcan aid in the management and characterization of these libraries. For example,compound purity and aqueous solubility constitute critical properties that needto be determined during drug lead optimization. Conventional HPLC systems canbe employed for these determinations, but they suffer from their intrinsiclow-throughput nature when used in a serial mode. Micro parallel liquidchromatography systems allow for high-throughput chemical analysis withincreased sample capacity and data analysis capabilities while reducing sampleconsumption, solvent usage, and waste generation. In this presentation, we willdescribe the use of a micro parallel liquid chromatography system that allowsfor the concurrent determination of compound purity and solubility for up to 23samples simultaneously. The system employed in these determinations is equippedwith 24 parallel columns for liquid chromatography, each with its own sampleintroduction port and exit port for connection to detector/s of choice. For thedeterminations presented here, UV detectors were employed for all columns withthe 24th column being also connected to a mass spectrometer for massconfirmation. The micro parallel liquid chromatography system employed in thesedeterminations significantly improved the overall time required for theindividual determinations with the added advantage of reduced sampleconsumption, solvent usage, and waste generation. The results discussed in thispresentation demonstrate the advantages of employing a micro parallel liquidchromatography system with MS capability for high-throughput chemical analysis.
It is well known that high-resolution higher-speed analysiscan be achieved using longer column with smaller particle size media, maintaininghigher flow rate. However, even with the optimized particle size media, suchanalysis will give higher back-pressure to the system and the higher pressuresometimes compromises the quality of the analysis.
We studied those side effects of higher pressure, and optimizedthe system to improve the highquality of the data. Some considerations to the system are reported to demonstrate the quality of the system.
Pesticides are widely used by farmers to control pests,weeds, and molds that would otherwise decrease crop production. While this hassignificantly increased worldwide food productions, the pesticides posesignificant health and environmental risks. The restrictions for specificpesticides differ from one country to the next.
Since many different types of pesticides can be used on thesame food product, multiresidue screening approaches are used to look simultaneously formultiple classes of pesticide compounds. Considering that there aremore than 500 registered pesticides, no single analysis technique is capable ofscreening for all possible contaminates. However, gas chromatography (GC) isstill the most commonly used method for the majority of the pesticide classes.While analyte-specific detectors such as ECD or NPD may be used for screening,mass spectrometer (MS) detection must be employed to provide positiveconfirmation.
The current work demonstrates the use of two new and uniquephases which have been optimized for the analysis of all classes of pesticides.The phase chemistry improves separation and peak shape for the more polarpesticide compounds when compared to standard 5% phenyl columns. Selectivitydata is compared between a 5-milli-second-type phase and the two new columns.
Multipesticide residue screening is evaluated over 250different pesticides commonly analyzed from fruits and vegetables. The uniqueselectivity offered by the two phases improves resolution for multicomponentanalytes providing a more unique elution pattern which can be used to identifyclosely eluting analytes.
Real-world samples in various fields (e.g., petrochemical,food and flavor, and environmental) are often very complex. Resolution of allindividual compounds by means of GC separation can be challenging. Heart-cuttingtwo-dimensional GC (GC-GC) on dissimilarphases can significantly improve the resolution of complex samples. Modern GC-GC systemsusually employ deactivated miniature switching device based on Deans principle,electronic pneumatic control (EPC), cryogenic focusing device, and double GCovens. However, cryogenic focusing device and double ovens require high cost(instrument, cryogen, space, and electronic power consumption).
Recently, low thermal mass (LTM) GC based on the directresistive heating principle has been developed. The small mass of the LTM-GCprovides fast temperature programing rates combined with rapid cool-down forthe shortest possible analytical cycle times. Apower consumption is also only about 1% of conventional GC. An LTM-GC can bedirectly integrated with conventional GC instruments to allow full use ofconventional injectors, detectors, sampling systems, and software.
In this study, we used an LTM-GC for second-dimensionalseparation of GC-GC withindependent temperature control. This configuration allows efficientsecond-dimensional separation without cryogenic focusing and an additional GCoven. The potential of the system was illustrated by examples of GC-GC-MS and sequentialGC-GC-MS of complexsamples, for example, diesel oil, essential oil, and food extracts.
Environmental air samples typically comprise a complexmixture of low-concentration compounds requiring enrichment procedures andhigh-resolution chromatography for accurate analysis. The wide volatility andpolarity range of organic compounds present in the atmosphere requires adequatechromatographic resolution or selective detection.
A thermal desorber/fast gas chromatograph/mass spectrometercoupling has been developed as a transportable analyzer perform sensitive analysis in field online.
The objective with Fast-GC is to reduce analysis time without loss ofseparation efficiency. Provided specific fragment ions are available for eachco-eluting compound a mass spectrometric detector can cope with poor Fast-GC column separation. The thermal desorber is a system for online speciated measurement of multiple trace-level volatileorganic compounds in air. It combines automated and controlled-flow samplingwith cryogen-free concentration technology. The thermal desorber connects to aFast-GC/MSD and is designed for unattended operation in remote fieldlocations.
Contamination of materials intended for consumer consumptionmay be difficult to determine in complex matricies. Tobacco in the finishedproduct is a particularly challenging example, as it contains plant metabolitesfrom the tobacco leaf as well as degradation products of the metabolitesresulting from aging of tobacco and processing. While target analyticaltechniques can reliably identify many compounds, the reliability depends on sufficientseparation of components in the mixture for the particular analytical technique.Analyses are limited, to thetarget list of compounds. With adequate separation and capability to rapidlyevaluate the separated compounds, screening is possible, but automation isrequired in complex systems such as tobacco. The application of GC × GC-TOFMS andautomated spectral searching for spectral features associated withcontamination combined with target analysis takes advantage of the high peak capacityafforded by GC × GC techniques. In addition it makes use of the full-scan spectra from components atlow concentration, and automated searching of the peak table for suspectcontaminants. This work shows the application of this technique to tobacco.
Gas chromatography (GC) is a commonly used method for thestudy of volatile and semivolatile compounds in complex mixtures. GC-TOFMSusing an electron ionization (EI) source produces spectra with highlyreproducible fragmentation patterns that can be automatically compared againststandard libraries for the identification of sample components. Through the useof chemical ionization (CI), a relatively soft ionization technique, themolecular ion is preserved with minor fragmentation making it complimentary toEI and allowing the simple determination of the analyte molecular weight.The LECO GC-TruTOF-HT MS system features easily interchangeable ion sourcesallowing analysis of a sample in either EI or CI mode. The ion source isisolated from the TOF mass analyzer, which allows for a fast turnaround whenthe ion source is changed.
In this presentation, we will give a brief introduction tothe TruTOF HT system including performance characteristics. The power of thissystem will be demonstrated by showing a complete characterization of a seriesof gasoline-range hydrocarbons using GC-TOFMS in both EI and CI modes. Structuralcharacteristics revealed by the EI spectra combined with molecular ionmeasurements seen in the CI spectra aid in the overall sample componentidentification. The automated peak-find and deconvolution features of ChromaTOFsoftware in both EI and CI modes use of high-speed GC enables techniquesto further increase sample throughput. Sample analysis in both EI and CI modesis shown to be complete in a short time.
A new kinetic calibration was developed using dominant pre-equilibriumdesorption by solid phase microextracton (SPME). The calibration was based onisotropism between absorption and desorption, which was proved theoreticallyand experimentally in an aqueous solution and semisolid matrix. It thereforeallows for the calibration of absorption using desorption to compensate matrixeffects. Moreover, concentration profiles are initially proposed to verifyisotropism between absorption and desorption, and also provide a linearapproach to obtain time constants for the purpose of quantitative analysis.This linear approach is more convenient, robust, and accurate than the nonlinearone with the previously used time profiles. Furthermore, this method employsthe target analytes as the internal standards, so radioactive or deuteratedinternal standards are not necessary compared to the previously reportedtechnique. In addition, dominant pre-equilibrium desorption utilizes thepre-equilibrium approach and offers a shorter sample preparation time, which istypically suitable for in vivo sampling. This kinetic calibration method wassuccessfully applied to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons' (PAHs) samplepreparation in a flow-through system and in vivo pesticide sampling in a jadeplant (Crassula ovata).
The potential health hazards that arise from chemicalpollutants in water have been an increasing concern to the water industry andenvironmental research. Online analysis of pollutants, most frequently organicherbicides and trace metals, is a pathway to real-time monitoring of waterquality. Due to the low concentration of these pollutants in water, samplepreparation demands the development of effective sampling tools. Currently we have designed and fabricated an automatic water sampling system for concentration of chemicalpollutants in water using solid phase extraction (SPE) technique. The setup andoperation procedures are described and applications are discussed. Thedescribed water sampling system has various applications in online preconcentrationof chemical pollutants prior to separation and detection with chromatographicand spectroscopic analyzers, for example, CE, HPLC, and LC-MS as well asbiosensors and imaging techniques. By selecting a correct SPE cartridge,this system applies to organic herbicides and pesticides, trace heavy metalions, and biochemical toxins in tap water, industry water, and natural waters.
This paper is being submitted for the symposium, achievements,and challenges in mass spectrometry. Chemicals dispersed by accidental,deliberate, or weather-related events must be rapidly identified to assesshealth risks. Mass spectra from high levels of analytes obtained using rapid,open-air ionization by a direct analysis in real-time (DART) ion source oftencontain precursor, oxide, adduct, and/or dimeric ions. Ion compositions must bedetermined and ion correlations must be made to understand composite massspectra and enhance confidence in tentative identifications. These tasks are performedrapidly by an in-house ion correlation program (ICP) that considers exactmasses and relative isotopic abundances measured by a JEOL AccuTOFtime-of-flight mass spectrometer. ASCII files provided by the data systemacquired at three CID voltages are imported into the ICP. Possible precursorions and related oxidized ions, ammonium adducts, protonated dimers, andammoniated dimers are found in the lowest CID voltage mass spectrum. At theintermediate CID voltage, dimeric ions are fragmented, while possible precursorions remain and are confirmed as such. Product ions are gleaned from thehighest CID voltage spectrum. Starting with the highest-mass precursor ion, alllower-mass ions that are not precursor ions are checked to see if they areprecursor ion subunits. When multiple compounds are present with differentcollections of heteroatoms, some product ions will and some will not correlatewith each precursor ion. Examples of mass spectra deconvolution will bedemonstrated for data acquired with the DART/TOFMS.

Accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) is a rapid samplepreparation technique that uses common organic solvents to extract solid orsemisolid samples. Using ASE, pressurized solvents are heated at or above theirboiling points. The use of hot pressurized solvents has many favorableextraction properties compared to traditional extraction techniques such asSoxhlet or sonication. For example, as temperature increases the solutionviscosity is reduced, resulting in less resistance to mass transfer as analytesdiffuse between solid and liquid phases. It is well known that diffusioncoefficients and analyte solubility increase with temperature. The effect ofreduced solution viscosity, higher analyte solubility, and increased diffusionaccelerates the extraction process resulting in rapid and efficient samplepreparation. ASE has been applied to many different analytes and numerousmatrices. In general, ASE methods are complete in 15–25 minutes andconsume 20–40 mL of solventper extraction. ASE is fully automated and can facilitate inline cleanup ofsome samples using resins and sorbents to retain some coextractables. ASE canbe used for environmental applications such as the extraction of pesticides,PAH's PCB's, TPH, dioxins, phenols, and phenolic herbicides in environmentalmatrices.
Due to the polar nature of phenols and phenoxy herbicides,the extraction and the commensurate recovery for analytical determination ofthese compounds can be challenging. Often acidic pretreatment of samples isrequired for efficient extraction of these compounds. A discussion of pretreatmenttechniques prior to ASE, to improve the recoveries of phenols andphenoxy herbicides will be presented.
Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) represent one of the majorcomponents associated with unpleasant odors coming from several liquid sourcessuch as wastewater treatment plants. As odor can be detected even at very lowconcentrations in the source, a preconcentration step of VFAs is required inorder to achieve trace-level quantitative analysis. The present work focuses onsolid phase microextraction (SPME), a recent preconcentration technique, and onthe effect of several parameters on extraction efficiency (fiber type, exposuretime, analyte concentration, salt content, pH, and temperature). Six shortchain VFAs were selected as model compounds (acetic, butyric, propionic,isopropionic, valeric, and isovaleric acids). After headspace extraction ofdifferent water matrixes, analysis of VFAs was carried out by gaschromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector. Optimization of thepreconcentration conditions was realized for every single compound. Moreover,different mixtures of the 6 VFAs were analyzed, in order to establish theconcentration conditions where a satisfactory linearity can be guaranteedwithout the competition phenomena known to occur during the SPME step,particularly for adsorptive fibers.
The performance-based requirements of method make it ademanding analytical procedure and not a simple replacement for the Freonprocedure. There are many quality control requirements that must be achieved inorder to meet the method parameters. A fully automated alternative to expensivelabor-intensive LYLE methods for extracting oil and grease from aqueous samplesis available.
One simple way to achieve compliance quickly is to use SPAand completely automate the process. Solutions are available that can handle upto three samples simultaneously; the water sample is kept in the originalsample container and is loaded directly onto either extractor unit. Theoperator initiates the run, and approximately 20 minutes later (based on thesize of the SPA disk used and the cleanliness of the sample) the sample isautomatically processed; the extract is then ready for the next step.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is placingincreasing pressure on coal-fired power plants to reduce mercury emissions by70% by the year 2018. EPA 30B describes various techniques for sample prep andanalysis of mercury as a reference method for Hg CEM's and sorbent trap monitoringsystems used in coal-fired boilers. Traditional techniques like wet chemistrydigestion/reduction followed by spectroscopic analysis are time-consuming,costly, and operator-dependent. The alternative technique of thermaldecomposition, amalgamation, and atomic absorption spectroscopy requires noacid digestion and delivers results in approximately 5 minutes. Direct analysisof mercury using this technique has also been specified in ASTM Method D6722-01for the analysis of mercury (Hg) in coal and coal combustion residues. Currentand proposed methodologies will be discussed with sorbent trap and other coal-relatedsample data presented from analyses using the Milestone DMA-80 direct mercury analyzer.
The analysis of basic, acidic, and neutral drugs of abuse inurine is accomplished with a single small volume sample solution using amixed-mode disposable pipette extraction (DPX) product. The extraction ofacidic and neutral drugs is accomplished using reversed-phase and hydrophobicmechanisms, and the extraction of basic drugs is performed utilizing cationexchange. The recoveries of several basic drugs such as tricyclicantidepressants, PCP, opiates, and meperidine are between 80–100%. Therecoveries of the acidic and neutral drugs, such as barbiturates, glutethimide,and COOH-THC, are greater than 80%. By combining the two modes, comprehensivescreening is readily accomplished from single small volume samples which haverelevance in toxicological analyses of saliva and sweat.
The main advantages of DPX technology are that the extractionsare very rapid; negligible solvent waste is generated, and the extractions canbe fully automated and coupled to chromatographic injections. Using a GerstelMPS-2 instrument, the DPX extractions can be performed offline or “inline”with a GC or HPLC instrument. This study includes both applications ofautomated DPX extractions. It is found that the extractions can be performedduring the time required for chromatographic analysis, and therefore throughputcan be optimized by performing the analyses “inline” withchromatographic instrumentation. In this study, the comprehensive analysis of just0.2 mL of urine samples is performed “inline” with GC/MS (AgilentTechnologies 6890 with 5973 MSD) with runtimes of less than 10 minutes.
Laboratories in a variety of industries areunder increasing pressure to ensure compliance with an ever growing number ofnational and international regulations. Some of the better known compliancestandards include NELAC, HACCP, EPA, USDA, FDA, CFR 21 Part 11, ISO,Sarbanes-Oxley, and GLP. To help manage the challenges of maintainingcompliance, organizations are turning to laboratory information managementsystem (LIMS) as their “secret weapon.”
Understanding the regulations and putting in place a provenprocess to maintain compliance are critical because the implications ofbecoming noncompliant can be very costly. This is especially true forlaboratories in highly regulated industries like food and beverage:pharmaceutical and environmental (water quality). Many organizations have foundthat a well-designed LIMS can actually provide the foundation for a successfulregulatory compliance process.
This paper will focus on the many benefits that a laboratoryinformation management system (LIMS) can provide to specifically help anorganization maintain regulatory compliance. This includes automating many ofthe laboratory activities to eliminate potential data transcription errors. TheLIMS can also provide audit tracking capabilities that will identify the sourceof noncompliance, while providing real-time alerts to warn the organization whenresults exceed prespecified limits. In this way, the LIMS is providing avaluable monitoring service and helps to ensure regulatory compliance.
As a laboratory grows, being more efficient and productivebecomes an integral part in success and continued growth. Most laboratorieshave already taken the first steps in automating their laboratory processes byimplementing a laboratory information management system (LIMS). Somelaboratories have even taken further steps to enhance their LIMS by includingfunctions such as instrument integration, bar code solutions, access to datavia the Internet, and autoemailing and faxing of reports.
The introduction of a mobile device is ideal for industriesrequiring field data collection. The ability to prelog samples and accesssample and client information is no longer confined to the laboratory alone. Amobile device provides laboratory personnel access to this information at theirfingertips. This contributes to laboratory productivity by providing paperlessprocesses and eliminating transcription errors.
This presentation will review how using a mobile device canfurther increase productivity and enhance laboratory processes.
In organic chemistry, carbonyl groups are functional groupsconsisting of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom. Carbonyl groupsfound within aldehyde and ketone compounds are known by the oleochemicalindustry to pose many problems during the processing of alcohols, most notablybecause of their potential to contribute unwanted color. Alcohols can createaldehydes in the presence of heat, oxygen, and a catalyst, which can all bepresent during the alcohol distillation process. Numerous companies in theindustry have methods to try to control the amount of aldehydes being produced,but the carbonyl content of the alcohol is still tested to ensure low levels.
The goal of this automated method was to meet the stricttiming criteria for reagent addition, heating, and cooling, while at the sametime maintaining good accuracy and precision. This method also helps to free upoperator time as the automated system controls all sample preparation andanalysis without user intervention.
The method is performed by adding an excess amount of2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) to hot alcohol samples in an acidic medium.The carbonyl present in the sample will react with the DNPH to form hydrazoneand water. An excess of base is then added to decompose any excess DNPH andform a quinoidal ion. After cooling the solution, the sample is then measuredin a spectrophotometer at 530 nm, and compared to a standard curve.
This method conforms to ASTM E 411—standard testmethod for trace quantities of carbonyl compounds with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine.Further detail on the advantages of the automated system and the methodprocedure, along with statistical data for various alcohol samples, will bediscussed.
The density variations within a material can affect thematerial's performance. Mapping the density variations with a sample can bedifficult and time-consuming.
This presentation will demonstrate the ability oftime-domain Terahertz (TD-THz) to make such measurements on a range ofmaterials (e.g., foam, paper, and wood products). The method employed uses essentiallysingle-cycle pulses (1 ps width) of EM radiation to probe the sample. The EMpulse will reflect off interfaces with differing refraction indices. Measuringof the time of flight from the first surface of a sample and from the substrateon which the sample is sitting allows the thickness of the material to beprecisely measured. The time-of-flight delay of the pulse through the materialhas been demonstrated to be highly correlated to a material's mass (for manyvarious materials). These two measurements allow the precise determination ofdensity.
The THz pulse can be focused to relatively small spots (1 mmor less), and thus mapping the density variations within a material isstraightforward.
TD-THz instrumentation can make noncontact measurements atlarge standoff distances (reflection sensor has working distances adjustablefrom less than 1 cm up to 100 cm). Measurements are made in real time, withtypical waveform acquisition rates of 100 Hz. Higher-speed operation has beendemonstrated. The sensor heads are connected to the instrument with fiber opticand electrical umbilicals. Thus, the heads can be moved to map an object or canbe placed in remote location(s) for online measurements. Multiplexing of 8sensor heads from the instrument has been demonstrated.
Real-time monitoring of organic reactions and otherpharmaceutical processes can provide very valuable information. Exampleinformation includes reaction kinetics progress, mechanisms, impurityformation, reaction optimization, and dissolution rates. Despite the need,there are presently few attractive options for monitoring pharmaceutical processes.FTIR probes have been available for some time, but the technique's limitedspecificity severely limits its application to a small fraction of processes.HPLC is a much more universal technique than FTIR; however this requires verytime-consuming human intervention for sample withdrawal and dilution. Thismanual process is also prone to human error.
We have developed a system that automates the sampling anddilution process and allows unattended monitoring of pharmaceutical processesby HPLC. The system includes a sampling and dilution module, an HPLC and systemsoftware. The system is contained on a compact cart for portability. Real-worldprocesses can be monitored with sample volumes of tens of microliters. Thesystem is capable of sampling from reactions with a moderate amount ofparticulates and up to 100 psi of pressure.
The authors will describe real-time monitoring of reactionprogress from organic reactors using an inline autosampler and dilution devicecoupled to an HPLC. Analytical figures of merit for the system will bediscussed.
Saponification is a common test procedure in theoleochemical industry. Oils, usually in the form of triglycerides, are brokendown into methyl esters, which are then hydrogenated into alcohols. Thesealcohols are then typically sulfated in order to be converted to surfactants.The presence of esters in the alcohol affects the sulfation process, and istherefore undesirable. Saponification value is a measure of the number ofmilligrams of potassium hydroxide required to saponify one gram of fat, whichis a good indication of the amount of esters present in the sample.
This automated method was developed to help free up operatortime and to improve the accuracy and precision of the manual method. In orderto improve the reproducibility of results, a new covering/uncovering system wasdeveloped for use in this method, including the automatic pickup and drop-offof lids by using an electromagnet. The new automated method also helps to eliminateoperator error, particularly during the delivery of the extremely criticalsodium hydroxide solution. In addition, accuracy is improved by using apotentiometric endpoint rather than the subjective color change endpoint in the manual method.
The method involves the addition of 50 mL of ethanolicsodium hydroxide to blanks and fat samples, and heating for one hour thenthe remaining base is back-titrated with hydrochloric acid. The difference between the blankand the samples is directly proportional to the amount of ester in the samples.
This method was originally developed for the oleochemicalindustry, but it may also be used by the petrochemical industry to test thequality of engine oils following ASTM D94: standard test methods forsaponification number of petroleum products. Further detail on the advantagesof the automated system and the method procedure, along with statistical datafor various fat samples, will be discussed.
Atmospheric aerosols can negatively affect both theenvironment and health, and therefore aerosol composition needs to be routinelymonitored. Water-soluble inorganic ions are currently monitored using theparticle-into-liquid sampler coupled to ion chromatography (PILS-IC). PILS-ICgives a seven-minute temporal resolution with detection limits near 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter of air for nitrate and sulfate. However, a less expensive,faster, and more portable system is desirable. Here, we describe the coupling ofmicrochip capillary electrophoresis (MCE) to a water-based condensationparticle counter (WCPC) for rapid and continuous monitoring of anions inaerosols. To achieve a working system, several obstacles were overcome. Aworking interface between MCE and the WCPC was developed. A membrane containingsample reservoir was included to filter insoluble aerosols and to inhibitsampling-induced hydrodynamic flow. A flushing system was designed to clean andreplenish the sample reservoir, and the electrophoresis separation chemistrywas optimized to operate continuously for extended times. In-field performanceof the integrated system was tested with atmospheric aerosols. Inorganic anionscan be analyzed in less than a minute with detection limits similar to thePILS-IC, but with improved portability and cost. Continuous monitoring oforganic acids was not previously possible, but it is feasible with WCPC-MCE.Coupling microfluidic devices to aerosol sampling technology proves successfulfor analyzing water-soluble anions, and can be extended to other portions ofaerosols such as cations and carbohydrates. The reduced cost and size relativeto current technology will alllow a greater deployment of monitoring stationsor the development of portable analyzers may be feasible (see Figure 14).
Derivatization of an analyte prior to analysis can stabilizethe molecule, improve extraction efficiency and separation characteristics, andenhance detection sensitivity. All of these advantages are important for theanalysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) as a biomarker of oxidative stress inbiological samples. Conventionally, however, the derivatization process iscumbersome, resulting in a significant lengthening of total sample preparationtime, reduced analytical precision, and limited options for automation.
We have addressed these challenges for the solid phaseanalytical derivatization of MDA from small volume tissue homogenate samples,employing the fluorescent derivatization reagent dansyl hydrazine andchromatographic separation. This was achieved by an automated column-switchingtechnique where the online derivatization was conducted in a sample preparationcartridge packed with Amberlite XAD-2 resin, followed by elution of the productto an analytical LC column and fluorescence detection. The limit of detectionfrom tissue homogenate samples was 0.02 μg/mL. The method was linear (r2 > 0.999) with precision <5% relative standard deviation from the limitof quantification (0.06 μg/mL) to at least 35 μg/mL. The sample preparationcartridge was stable for several hundred analyses with a pressure limit of 700 psi.
The method was applied for the analysis of a small volume (30 μL) of mouse liver tissue homogenate samples. Endogenous levels of MDA in thetissues ranged between 20–40 nmol/g tissues(ca. 0.1–0.2 μg/mLhomogenate). As there was nosuitable method for MDA analysis to validate the developed method, the datawere compared to those for isoprostanes, with favourable results. Isoprostanes analysis provides anadditional marker of oxidative stress. Compared to conventional MDA analyses, the current method has advantagesin automation, selectivity, precision, and sensitivity for analysis from smallsample volumes.
The electrical transformer is a necessary link in theconsumers' power distribution use. The performance of the transformers dependson the condition of the dielectric fluid (usually mineral oil). The dielectricfluid is used for the purpose of insulation and as a cooling medium for thetransformer. In an attempt to minimize the detrimental actions of oxygen duringoperation, the oxidation inhibitor 2,6 Di-tertiary Butyl p Cresol (DBPC) isadded to the mineral oil at about 0.3 weight percent (wt%). Over time, theinhibitor is used up and it becomes necessary to analyze the oil for theremaining DBPC adjust the level to the optimum value of0.3 wt%. This can be accomplished quantitatively with infrared spectroscopy.The absorbance of a solution of the DBPC inhibitor in the mineral oil adheresto Beer-Lambert law which states that the absorbance is a function of theconcentration. Deviations from linearity can be determined by obtainingabsorbance values from known amounts of inhibitor in mineral oil and bycreating a calibration table. Dielectric fluid is typically sampled in thefield by a service technician, and delivered to a remote laboratory foranalysis.
A study was undertaken to determine whether a portable infraredinstrument could be used to analyze the dielectric fluid at the field location.Several transformer dielectric fluid customer samples (used mineral oil) withDBPC inhibitor content, previously analyzed with a laboratory bench top FT-IRby ASTM Method D-2668, were selected for this study. These samples were run onportable infrared spectrophotometers with a mineral oil blank and a one-pointDBPC standard. A comparison of the results of the portable IR analyzers to thebench top FT-IR spectrophotometer revealed very good agreement of 0.02–0.05 wt% betweenthe two instruments. All the reagents used in the procedure are common andreadily available to test personnel.
Precious metals analysis is of prime importance to manufacturersfor the control of quality at all stages from raw material through work in progressto life-expired articles or scrap. Its many applications include chemicalcatalysts, residues, bullions, and plating solutions in addition to analysis ofthe purity of the high precious metal or alloy.
Traditionally, ICP has been used to maintain the QA but the QC routinesare often cumbersome and use time-consuming digestion and analysis routines. The useof microwave digestion greatly reduces the sample preparation time, while theuse of cutting-edge technology and method development tools now allows rapidanalysis of precious metals with high precision.
This paper will look at the effectiveness of the new modelsfor this application, looking at stability, sensitivity, and precision usingICP.
Measurements of mercury in ambient air are assuming greaterimportance, because of increasing health concerns and legislative requirements.The general public and the environment can be exposed to mercury originatingfrom natural, domestic, or industrial processes. Coal-burning power plants arethe largest anthropogenic source of mercury emissions to the air. Burninghazardous wastes, the chlor-alkali industry, crematoria, breaking mercuryproducts, and spilling mercury, as well as the improper treatment and disposalof products or wastes containing mercury, can also release it into theenvironment.
In this paper, we will describe automated onlineinstrumentation based on amalgamation with atomic fluorescence spectrometry. Aknown volume of ambient air at a controlled flow rate is passed over a gold impregnatedsilica trap. Total gaseous is preconcentrated on the gold substrate byamalgamation. After the collection period, the Hg is thermally desorbed andsubsequently delivered to the atomic fluorescence spectrometer specificallydesigned to detect Hg. The analytical performance of the system will bepresented along with data from rural, coastal, and urban industrial sites fromseveral European countries.
The clean air mercury rule provides a regulatory regime forthe control of mercury emissions from coal-fired utilities in USA. The rulerequires the installation of continuous emission monitoring systems at themajority of such utilities, and provides a detailed regime of tests to validatedata from the emissions' monitoring system. Elemental and oxidized mercurycalibration gases traceable to national standards are required for thevalidation tests.
The P S Analytical continuous emission monitoring system hasbeen used to monitor gas phase mercury concentrations in coal-fired utilitystack gas. The instrument consists of a sampling probe, heated sample transferline, sample conditioning system, analyzer, and calibration modules.
The sampling probe extracts sample from the stack, separatesthe gaseous sample from fly ash, and delivers the diluted sample to the sampleconditioner via the heated sample line. The sample is conditioned to convertall mercury in the sample to elemental mercury, and is delivered to the analyzerwithout the need for water injection. Mercury in the sample is determined byamalgamation coupled with atomic fluorescence in the Sir Galahad analyser,providing a method detection limit of less than 0.01 μg m3.
A calibration gas generator and a delivery manifold system areincorporated to deliver known-concentration calibration gases to the samplingsystem for system integrity validation tests.
The various components of the PSA Hg CEM will be described,and results of recent field experience of the system and compliance with theregulatory tests will be presented.
Mercury has been recognized as an environmental risk formany years. Environmental organizations, governments, researchers, andconcerned citizens throughout the world continue striving to understand the role of mercury and its impact upon ecosystems. Mercury is mobile, persistent, and bioaccumulative,rendered as a global concern that will not go away. As such, there is a need tomeasure mercury concentration in many types of samples including air, water,soil, fish, fowl, mammals, foods, and fuels to name just a few. Until recently,the sample preparation and instrument calibration for mercury determinationsvaried with sample matrix resulting in dedicated methodology for each type ofsample analyzed. Using the thermal decomposition technique, the analyst canlook at a variety of samples without modifying methodology.
Recent changes to the thermal decomposition technique andenvironmental monitoring regulations will be described. Analytical performanceusing thermal decomposition will be presented and compared with earlier coldvapor atomic absorption methods.
Raman spectroscopy has long been used in semiconductorresearch, mostly for silicon studies and then for alloyed materials. It hasbeen proved useful to measure strain on patterned Si wafers, or look at the stoichiometry of alloys. Raman spectroscopy has evolved from a complex analysistechnique, reserved to research and development only, to a user-friendly toolavailable to the industry. HORIBA Jo binYvon presents how Raman spectroscopy has become a very powerful tool nowavailable for inline monitoring of the strain in strained silicon blanketwafers as well as devices in patterned wafers. It can also help monitor theinfluence of FEOL processes on the stress and ensure the quality of therealized devices. It can also be used to verify the crystalline quality and to detectand review defects and dislocations. The most recent papers published on strainedsilicon research are reviewed to identify and stress the measurementchallenges relative to this new generation of engineered wafers and to assessthe technical and physical limitations. Finally, requirements for a tool formanufacturing are reviewed, and the latest technological developments show howthey bring manufacturers' expectations to a reality and to measure submicronfeatures.
This presentation focuses on undergraduate researchinvolving quantitation of mercury in hair from female adults of child-bearingage (20–40 years) and thecorrelation of the results with mercury contamination from hair dyes, andpossible effects of this source of mercury contamination on reproductivecapabilities of females in the aforementioned age group. Mercury is currentlyof intense interest because of its high toxicity at sub-micro-gram per-gramconcentrations and its abundance in Earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere dueto natural and human sources. Human hair yields a more permanent record ofheavy metal contamination than such samples as blood and urine. In this study,the authors focused on possible mercury contamination from hair dyes. Hairsamples were collected from at least 20 anonymous subjects. Samples weredigested using microwave techniques, and analyzed for mercury by cold vaporatomic absorption spectrometry. Statistical analysis of the data using a SPSS statistical software package. Experimental aspects, resultsobtained, and future directions for this project will be discussed.
A near infrared (NIR) spectral collection scheme, employingdirect transmission through Teflon tubing, has been recently studied for themeasurement of etchant solution. Alternatively Raman spectroscopy can be usedfor the same purpose since it could provide more selective and diverse spectralinformation compared to NIR spectroscopy, especially for the components inetchant solutions, such as H2O2 and inorganic acids. ForRaman measurement, we have developed a novel Raman collection scheme, usingTeflon (PFA: perfluoroalkoxy fluorocarbon) tubing as an effective andsynchronous external standard. Therefore, the resulting spectrum is the sum ofspectral features from the sample and the Teflon tubing, which allows thenonoverlapping Teflon bands to be used to correct variations in the Ramanintensity. We also built a pilot-scale chemical wet station that can simulate areal cleaning bench and generate continuous flow, and Raman spectra were thendirectly collected from online samples. We used a Metal Aluminum Etchant (MAE)solution (composed of H3PO4, HNO3, CH3COOH,and water)—one of the mostfrequently utilized etchants—for this study.PLS calibration models were built for each component, and their onlineprediction selectivities were evaluated by spiking individual components into asample mixture. Additionally, NIR spectra were simultaneously collected with Raman measurement for comparison. NIR discrimination between H3PO4 and HNO3 features was somewhat difficult, while Raman spectralfeatures were distinct for these compounds. Overall, Raman spectroscopy alsowould be a simple and selective tool for the monitoring of diverse etchantsolutions.
Modern mobility spectrometers have arisen as handheld ruggedinstruments through interests in military preparedness and commercial aviationsecurity. The principles of ion formation and characterization in air atambient pressure were compatible with some of the attractive features ofmobility-based instruments portability, comparatively cost of ownership oroperation, low detection limits for certain important chemicals, and fastresponse. Twenty-five years after the introduction of the first generation ofin-field ion mobility analyzers, this technology increasingly accepted inindustrial or medical applications is occurring. A survey of these usesillustrates the strengths of this measurement method and the fundamental ortechnical barriers that limit expanded civilian uses. Often these are found inthe same facet such as the ionization step where gas phase ion chemistry atambient pressure establishes advantages of sensitivity and disadvantages, onoccasions, of matrix interferences. The growth of small and fast gaschromatographs improves analytical integrity. Other prefractionation methodscan aid the analytical reliability in the first step of analytical response, ionformation. Ion characterization with relatively low resolution devices is beingrefined through tandem analyzers based on mobility or differential mobilitywith little increase in size, weight, or power consumption. Current trends andfuture directions in both technology and applications will be described.
A driving force in moving GC-MS from the laboratory to thefield was the requirement for faster analysis and turnaround times inenvironmental analysis. Initial instruments represented ruggidized versions oflab GC/MS. Because trained environmental chemists were typically the instrumentoperators, sample collection/preparation and analysis methods were transferredfrom the lab to the field. A lesson learned from this experience is that “whatworks in the lab does not always work in the field.”
Researchers and manufacturers have succeeded in designing anew generation of truly portable GC-MS systems. Miniature ion traps underdevelopment provide smaller/lighter systems, with faster analysis times. After9/11, GC-MS found widespread use in homeland security applications. Operatorsare now often “hazmat technicians,” emergency responders, and/or 18-year-old marines.These operators are being tasked to understand the capabilities and limitationsassociated with using a GC/MS for a wide range of samples. Simplified samplingprocedures and flexibility in sampling methods are required.
Getting the “right sample” into the instruments isas important as the technology in the instrument. Solid phase micro extraction(SPME) offers a solution for sampling a wide range of chemicals without samplepreparation. Micro concentrators can be used for volatiles in air, withheadspace sampling for extraction of VOCs from soil or water. Modular designedsample inlet systems that support SPME and air sampling are part of thesolution. Innovation is still required, which lessens the skill requirements of operatorsfor sampling.
Monolithic silica-based columns (Chromolith) are becoming awell-accepted alternative to particulate-based traditional HPLC columns becauseof their high sample throughput with low back-pressure and their ruggedness tosample contaminants. The columns are manufactured in a proprietary and well-controlledenvironment.
As with all chromatography columns, the sorbent has to becharacterized in order to obtain reproducible results at the end-user's site. Withtraditional sorbents the characterization is made batchwise.
With monolithic columns, another approach is necessarybecause of the manufacturing process. All columns have to be testedindividually.
As no commercial system was available to fulfill all needs, testequipment was developed to evaluate up to 8 columns with up to 6 different eluentsystems for selectivity testing (see Figure 15). The paper discusses the basic manufacturingprocess for monolithic columns, the construction limitations of test equipmentand software development including calculation ofchromatographic parameters for a fully independent testing. Results will be presented for reproducibilitystudies as well as statistical data.

Are you achieving high throughput? How many samples can yourlab analyze per hour or per day? Today's drug discovery labs are charged withmoving thousands of samples through HPLC and MS screening processes. If yourlab is operating 24 × 7 to keep up with the throughput demand, every secondcounts. Not only must the runtime of a single analysis be shortened, but thetotal cycle time of the injection sequence and runtime need to be optimized, toachieve high throughput. Solvent management automation and real-timediagnostics allow you to increase sample throughput and maximize system uptimewhile meeting the need to produce reliable results and identify leads. Thisautomation and diagnostics can be achieved by installing an inline real-timeflow measurement device into the solvent management system.
By incorporating an inline flow metering device in thesolvent management system, it is possible to improve the accuracy of yoursystem and at the same time be able to diagnose the heath of the HPLC pump.This will help you manage the maintenance schedule for the system, and overtime should allow you to increase the time interval between maintenance cycles.You will also see real time if the pump is causing any flow pulsations. Ifpulsations are a problem you can modify the system to minimize the pulsationswith changes to the pump and/or the installation of a pulse dampener. In the next-generationsystems, it is possible to use the output from the flow measurement device in aflow control feedback loop with the pump to completely eliminate thepulsations. Some flow metering devices will also provide additional benefitssuch as real-time fluid density, concentration, or microbubble/two-phase flowindication.
If your goal is reducing maintenance or increasingthroughput, uptime, or quality, the installation of an inline flow measurementdevice into your system will help you achieve that goal.
Wavelength selection has always been an important part ofquantitative near infrared (NIR) analysis because of the overlapping nature ofNIR spectra and the resulting need for multivariate calibration models. Evenwhen full-spectrum factor-based techniques such as principal component analysis(PCA) or partial least-squares (PLS) are used, improved results are typicallyobtained when wavelength selection is performed prior to submitting the data tothe PCA or PLS algorithms. Effective wavelength selection can result in modelswith fewer factors, which are easier to deploy and maintain and are less likelyto be adversely affected by unmodeled interferences. In this work, a recentlyproposed global optimization method, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is usedto implement an automated wavelength selection procedure for use in buildingmultivariate calibration models based on PLS regression. Compared to sometraditional optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GA), PSO iseasy to implement and there are few parameters to adjust. The measurement ofglucose in a six-component biological matrix. NIR spectroscopy over anextended time period is employed to develop this protocol. In this work, PSO isused to optimize the NIR wavelengths supplied to the PLS calculation, theposition and width of a preprocessing bandpass digital filter, and the numberof latent variables employed in building the calibration model. The resultsobtained with the PSO method are compared to analogous results obtained with aGA-based procedure. The stability of glucose predictions over time will be ofparticular emphasis in evaluating the success of the methodology.
Multivariate algorithmic approaches seen in the chemometricliterature are applied to solve various problems, including patternrecognition, classification, and quantification. In most cases, a single algorithm(or, at most, 2) is used to demonstrate success (or, sometimes, failure) for aparticular application. Invariably, a single implementation of the algorithm isused, whether it is from a commercial software package or from a customdeveloped platform.
This study was developed to compare both algorithms andimplementations commonly used in chemometric work. To serve this purpose,French virgin olive oils samples were collected. Fatty acids and triacylglycerols weredeterminated by chromatography. To support the evaluation of pattern recognitionmethods, the registration denomination of origins (RDOs) was recorded; then,discrimination of different oils was attempted by several methods: PCA, KNN,SIMCA, and PLS-DA.
Performance of the various chemometric algorithms wasevaluated using three common software packages: PLS Toolbox (EigenvectorResearch), Pirouette (Infometrix), and Unscrambler (CAMO).
Nitrogen compounds are a serious issue for Cape Cod (Mass, USA)in part because of the large number of septic systems and runoffs of fertilizersfrom lawns. As a result, denitrification is of great concern on the Cape. The water testing laboratories in Barnstable County run samples for all 15 towns on Cape Cod.Typically, the nitrogen samples are run by ion chromatography (IC).
It would be useful to have a rapid and portable method formeasuring NH3, NO2−, and NO3−				 in the field. The colorimetric methods forthese nitrogen compounds are cumbersome and are not easily adaptable to fieldwork.
Ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) for environmental analysisof ammonia in discharges have been approved by EPA for >30 years. Recently,the EPA approved the nitrate and nitrite electrodes for the measurement of NO3−			 and NO2−				 in water. We will be using ISEs from PIDAnalyzers for this study. The potential will be determined with the PID Model104 water quality analyzer following the addition of the appropriate buffersolution.
Water samples will be collected from selected sites on theCape, analyzed by a standard method (IC) by the Barnstable County Water Labs,and then analyzed using PID Analyzers ISEs for 				NH3, NO2−, and NO3−. If high-nitrogenareas are located during the initial sampling, additional testing will occur inthese areas. For high-nitrogen areas, the sites will be tested in the fieldusing PID Analyzers ISEs, and then samples will be collected and returned tothe lab for testing by IC.
We will compare the methods by IC and ISE, determine whetherany interferences are found, and evaluate the ease of use of the ISE methods inthe field.
Chlorination is commonly used to disinfect drinking water inUSA. However, it reacts with natural organic matter (NOM) in the water, forminga range of disinfection by-products (DBPs) of public health concern. Thehalogenated by-products predominantly formed are the trihalomethanes (THMs) andhaloacetic acids (HAAs). The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)currently regulates five HAAs in drinking water: monochloroacetic acid (MCAA),dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), monobromoacetic acid(MBAA), and dibromoacetic acid (DBAA). The current maximum contaminant level(MCL) for the total concentration of these five HAAs (HAA5) is 0.060 mg/L. Fourunregulated HAAs can be present in drinking water: bromochloroacetic acid(BCAA), bromodichloroacetic acid (BDCAA), dibromochloroacetic acid (DBCAA), andtribromoacetic acid (TBAA). The HAA5 species and the four unregulated HAAs arecalled HAA9. Recently, iodinated HAAs have been also identified in drinkingwater.
An online automated method has been previously developed to analyzeHAA9 species using postcolumn reaction ion chromatography with nicotinamidefluorescence (PCR-IC). This gives method detection limits (MDL) of single μg/L,with good mean % recoveries and % relative standard deviations.
The goal of this work is to expand the PCR-IC method toinclude other haloacid analytes, such as iodoacetic acid and2,2-dichloropropionic acid (Dalapon). Additionally, internal standardizationwill be explored, initially using 2-bromobutanoic acid as a possible internalstandard for PCR-IC.
Optimization of analytical instrumentation is essential whenperforming ultra-trace-level analyses of persistent organic pollutants in humanserum. This research describes the analysis of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)in human serum using gas chromatography with mass-selective detection (GC/MSD)in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. In this study, human serum specimenswere initially spiked with PCB congeners and extracted by an automated solidphase extraction (SPE) system using silica-based C18 cartridges. The extractswere analyzed at two ion source temperatures, with 230°C being the default temperatureand 300°C being the maximum allowable one. The use of high ion sourcetemperature increased the abundance of high-mass ions, but alsoincreased response factors with an average of 10–20 folds. Tenreplicate fortifications of serum at three different levels of 0.5, 1, and 10 ng/g gave mean recoveries of 110, 108, and 85% with relative standard deviations(RSD) of 10.0, 5.4, and 7.0%, respectively. We will also demonstrate excellentlinearity between 0.5–100 ng/mL at anion source temperature of 300°C, as well as a calculated method of detectionlimit of 0.2 ng/g serum. We will present data obtained using analyticalstandards, serum spiked with 21 PCB congeners, and human serum specimens extractedby an automated solid phase extraction system.
Pharmaceutical coatings on tablets play a significant rolein product's function. They increase the tablets' longevity and keep themintact until they are completely swallowed. To accomplish these vitalfunctions, pharmaceutical coatings must be accurately prepared and preciselyapplied. Tablet coatings have been traditionally sprayed onto the product,while the tablets are constantly moving in a tumbler. Maintaining consistent coating thickness during this process is an important parameter for quality control. Applying a coating that is thinner than specifications shortens thetablet shelf life. On the other hand, applying a coating that is thicker thanspecifications alters tablets' release characteristics. To strike the balancebetween these two undesirable extremes, tablet manufacturers have implementedroutine measurements of coating's viscosity. The viscosity of the coatingmaterial directly affects the size of the droplets coming out of the spraynozzle, and determines the pattern of the sprays. Traditionally, viscositymeasurements have been carried out offline. Periodic samples are taken from theproduction line to an analytical laboratory where viscosity is measured.However, offline measurements interrupt production, engage valuable humanresources, and fail to provide adequate process feedback. In this paper, aviscosity feedback control system is introduced to improve the quality andproductivity of tablet coating solution. The system is modeled, analyzed, anddesigned. Experimental results describe the performance of the viscosityfeedback control system such as response speed, accuracy, and steady stateerror. The reference tracking accuracy of the viscosity feedback control systemis better than +/− 0.3% of a target viscosity using an inline viscometer whichhas resolution of 0.2% of reading and repeatability of 1% of reading. Viscometer'sunique construction does not use any rotating seals or bearings that can generateimpurities and contaminate the fluid. All wetted surfaces are made of Teflon. Aversion of the inline viscometer made out of titanium is also available forprocesses that use steam as the sterilizing agent. Pharmaceutical companies nowhave an effective and automated viscosity feedback control system that they candeploy for spray coating of tablets to improve productivity, repeatability, andoverall product quality. 
Simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) refers to thesimultaneous application of two or more thermoanalytical methods on one sampleat the same time (usually thermogravimetry and differential scanningcalorimetry). The benefits of such a system are obvious. Frequently, thematerial available for testing is costly or difficult to produce. Using STA,it is possible to get information on the transformation energetics and themass change on one sample in one run under identical conditions. Glasstransitions, melting behavior, evaporation of plasticizers, and decompositioncan, for example, be analyzed within one test run. Furthermore, such systemscan easily be coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) or a Fouriertransform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR) to analyze the gases evolving duringevaporation or decomposition reactions.
The technical details of the state-of-the-artsimultaneous thermal analyzers and the interfaces to evolved gas analysissystems are presented. The application of STA-QMS systems on different organic materials(tobacco, cleaning aids) is shown. Furthermore, an FT-IR system connected to anSTA was used to characterize the gas release during decomposition of cigarettefilters. The examples clearly show the possibilities and benefits of combinedsystems in the fields of materials research and quality control.
Over the past few decades, industry has increased itsefforts to introduce quality-control systems in all areas of production toimprove quality and efficiency of the entire process. Raw materials must beanalyzed and characterized to make sure that the composition and structure ofprocess materials remain unchanged. Thermal analysis methods such asthermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, or thermomechanicalanalysis are well-established fast analytical techniques for materialscharacterization, especially in the polymer, pharmaceutical, metal, and ceramicindustries.
In this case, however, one has to make sure that theinstrument offers reliable results which do not depend on the specificinstrumentation used. Therefore, international accepted standards areintroduced into the analytical techniques to ensure that the instrument fulfillsspecific requirements and that the tests are carried out under comparableconditions.
Some examples for standards inmaterials characterization on the basis of thermal analysis techniques,frequently used in industrial research and quality-control labs are presented. The keycontents of ASTM, ISO, or DIN EN standards are mentioned, measurement examplesare presented, and the cross-link to the production process is given.Furthermore, thermal analysis techniques generally used in the quality-controllabs of modern industrial production plants are shown.
A significant modification to the well-proven band-targetentropy minimization (BTEM) curve resolution technique coined as automatic BTEM(AutoBTEM) was recently developed. It provided several enhancements to theoriginal BTEM algorithm, notably, (i) automatic band-targeting of prominent/localizedspectral features (band-targets) found in the abstract right orthonormalsingular VT vectors using a statistical function, (ii)automatic specification of band-target range (upper and lower spectral limits)using a novel user-specified bandwidth and band-targets clustering algorithm,and (iii) a near-blind source separation (near-BSS) of multicomponentspectroscopic mixtures into constituent pure component spectra via large-scaleBTEM optimization runs and subsequent application of an unsupervisedleader-follower cluster analysis.
This AutoBTEM algorithm has been successfullytested on 30-mixture Raman spectral data comprising 10 common laboratorysolvents. This 10-component mixture Raman dataset is a very challenginganalytical problem as firstly the 10 organic solvents possess highlyoverlapping bands in the region (ca. 800–1050 cm−1), and secondlythe number of underlying spectral components/factors is large. Furthermore, twoserendipitous corollaries were found in this AutoBTEM approach; namely, (i) thestatistical function employed for automatic band-targeting possesses predictivecapability to estimate the number of pure components that exists in a spectraldataset, and (ii) spectral band (peak center position) shifts of each potentialband-target can be quantitatively estimated from the band-targets clusteringalgorithm.
The river Cauca is an important hydric resource for the Republicof Colombia and especially for the city of Cali, located in the southwesternregion of the country. Unfortunately, the city takes the water for thepopulation consumption from the river, and it has been site of heavy metals'contamination from several sources. This has resulted in widespread heavymetals' contamination such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and chromium of the waterand surrounding sediments. It is well known that these metals can beintroduced into the food chain by several species of native fish. Consumptionof contaminated fish by people living around the river has resulted in moderatecontamination and health problems.
This work will present the determination of the heavy metalsHg, Pb, Cd, and Cr in samples of water from the river Cauca during a period of6 months. For the study, five sampling stations were used and sampling was doneduring the rainy and dry seasons. Pb, Cd, and Cr were adsorbed from watersamples using the resin XAD16, and the extracts were later analyzed by atomicabsorption with graphite furnace. Hg was analyzed using the technique of coldvapor and atomic absorption.
Results indicate a moderate-to-high contamination,especially in mercury and lead with concentrations up to hundreds of ppm.
By coupling ion chromatography with mass spectrometry, newfields of applications can be developed. In this work, IC/MS and IC-ICP/MS areused for the qualitative as well as quantitative analysis of environmentallyand industrially relevant compounds.
A great benefit of the hyphenated techniques is that theycan reach the high sensitivities that are required for the analysis ofwidespread water contaminants. The US Environmental Protection Agency and the EuropeanUnion currently prescribe a maximum bromate concentration of 10 ppb in drinkingwater. For mineral waters, the pertinent regulations stipulate a limit of 3 ppb. For perchlorate, a 6 ppb public health goal was established in USA. Bymeans of IC/MS coupling, detection limits in the lower ng/L range are achieved.Additionally, the higher selectivity helps to avoid coelutions and to suppressmatrix interferences to the absolute minimum. Using IC/MS it is possible toquantify carboxylic acids reliably in the presence of a high salt matrixcontaining approximately 100 g/L chloride.
The IC-ICP/MS technique is used for an improved speciationanalysis of hazardous substances. Organic and inorganic compounds can be determined in a single run with this hyphenated technique. Typical applications ofIC-ICP/MS are the analyses of chromium(III) and (VI) as well as the speciation of arsenic or selenium compounds.
Another application of the hyphenated techniques isunambiguous peak identification. Using IC/MS, parent compounds andcorresponding metabolites can be identified according to their mass/chargeratio. IC-ICP/MS is also used for element-specific analysis.
Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis is being used in anincreasing number of industrial and environmental testing applications. Theunique chemical and physical composition of samples such as metal platingsolutions, wastewater, and drinking water precludes the use of a single,universal sample oxidation method for TOC analysis. Optimization of wet oxidationmethods ensures that consistent and reliable data is obtained from the analysisof complex matrices.
This paper will describe the key variables and an efficientapproach to establishing and validating effective TOC methods. Comparison datafor other types of oxidative analyzers will also beprovided.
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the largesttarget class in drug discovery, and they are important in therapeutic areassuch as heart disease, metabolism, and immune disorders. The function is commonlyassessed in cells artificially overexpressing the receptor of interest usingfluorescent- or bioluminescent-based probes. With the CellKeyÔ system,functional activation of differently coupled endogenous GPCRs can be measuredin the same assay format and in their natural setting. In this study, we firstdemonstrate the sensitivity and ease of use of the CellKeyÔ system by measuringactivation of multiple differently coupled endogenous receptors on a singleplate of U-2 OS cells. The CellKeyÔ software is then used to group the uniqueresponse profiles generated by activation of these receptors by a predictedG-protein coupling mechanism. We also demonstrate the use of the CellKeyÔ systemto confirm the subtype of the histamine receptor indicated by the unique CDSkinetic response profile with the use of selective agonists and antagonists.Lastly, it is becoming increasingly apparent that crosstalk between signalingpathways occurs as a result of the normal activation of GPCRs. We show data toillustrate that the CellKeyÔ system can reveal a complex interplay among someGPCR-mediated signaling pathways, and that the data provides information toallow deconvolution of a complex signaling pathway. These studies detailpowerful techniques that can be applied to selectivity screening of compoundsand endogenous target validation.
Lachat Instruments has improved the throughput of the flowinjection methods for nitrate/nitrite (2 M KCl), ammonia (2 M KCl), and orthophosphate(Bray and Mehlich) in soils so that 120 samples per hour can be analyzed foreach analyte. This is a significant improvement (33–100%) over priormethods using flow injection analysis. Data will be presented showing thethroughput improvements for each analyte. In addition, configurations of theinstrument will be shown, which will allow users to optimize the throughput forsamples with different matrices.
A 4-minute single reagent method utilizing kinetic readingsover a 2-minute period has been developed for a completely automated discreteanalyzer. A 20 μL sample is added to a 230 μL heat-stabilized reagent, and 5readings are taken every 28 seconds at 405 nm. Results are quantified against amultipoint calibration. No sample preparation or filtration is necessary, anddisposable cuvettes are used to eliminate any possibility of carryover.Cuvettes consist of 12 different reaction cells allowing 6–12 reactions tooccur simultaneously. Fixed timing controlled in the method setup fulfills thenecessity of readings occurring at relatively the same time at the same rate.Side wavelength readings can be incorporated for additional potential interferencecorrection. Models are available with test rates from 2–600 tests per-hour.
Amylase enzymes are used extensively in bread making, high-fructosecorn syrup production, and sometimes in the manufacture of biofuels. It hasalso become an important ingredient in many cleaning products and detergents.Amylase breaks down complex sugars such as starch (found in flour and corn) intosimple sugars. In the breadmaking industry yeast then feed on these simple sugars and generateswaste products of alcohol and CO2. This process imparts flavor and causes the bread to rise. Amylaseis an important enzyme for manufacturing corn syrup and grain alcoholproduction. Amylase from Bacillus bacteria is used in detergents todissolve starches from fabrics. Amylase has also been used to controlviscosity in the chocolate industry.
				Purpose. The purpose of the present investigation is todevelop and validate a rapid, sensitive, and simple high-performance liquidchromatography method for the quantification of zidovudine, abacavir, andnevirapine in human plasma with a short runtime and quantification limitsufficiently low to support pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies. Methods.The method employed a liquid-liquid extraction from 0.5 mL plasma with amixture of diethyl ether and dichloromethane followed by extract evaporationand reconstitution. All the three analytes and IS were separated using anisocratic mobile phase on a monolithic column (100 mm × 4.6 mm) at a flow rateof 1.5 mL/min. Zonisamide was used as the internal standard to account fordifferences due to adsorption and extraction. Detection was set at a wavelengthof 220 nm. Results. Zidovudine, abacavir, nevirapine, and IS were elutedat retention times of 2.0, 2.4, 2.9, and 6.0 minutes, respectively. The shortretention times were achieved due to monolithic column which withstands highflowrates with low back-pressure. Method allows quantification ofall the three analytes in 40–5000 ng/mL range,and is fully validated as per FDA guidelines. The validation datademonstrates good precision (<4% CV) and accuracy (<8% RE). Conclusions.A rapid and specific assay has been successfully developed and applied for thequantifiacation of zidovudine, abacavir, and nevirapine in human plasmasamples.
HPLC method development is still considered as one of thecrucial bottlenecks that impede productivity in analytical laboratories. Due tothe variety of available columns, the proper selection of the stationary phaseis usually the greatest challenge. Despite all efforts in the fields ofphase characterization and phase property indexing, an unambiguous selectionapproach is not available. With the introduction of alkaline stable silica-basedstationary phases, a large palette of mobile phase additives and pH values isapplicable in reversed-phase chromatography. This results in a vast number ofparameters which have to be characterised in method development.
We present a new integrated system that allows automatic andintuitive scouting of columns, eluents, and other important method parameters,for example, column temperature. The system includes quaternary gradient capabilities,an autosampler compatible with well plate and standard sample formats, and adiode array detector. Up to two column selection valves in the columncompartment provide high application flexibility. Intelligent software makesparameter permutation easy, without requiring method changes. Data mining toolshelp evaluating results and identifying optimal conditions.
The application of this system to automatically screenpossible combinations of 6 different columns, 3 different organic solvents, 3different pH values, and 2 different temperatures for evaluating the separationproblem is presented. Peaks are tracked either via UV/Vis spectra comparison, or, whenthe system is equipped with a single-quadrupole mass spectrometer, via masscomparison. A spreadsheet-based reporting tool provides a peak resolutionchart. The most promising combinations of eluents, stationary phase, andtemperature are automatically predicted.
Rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC) has become anincreasingly useful approach to achieve higher throughput, improve sensitivity,and reduce costs. The Agilent 1200 “rapid resolution” LC systemenables faster analysis (up to 20×) than with conventional HPLC, whilstmaintaining resolution. This is achieved by using sub-2 micron column particlechemistry and high flow rates. Higher temperatures are used tominimize system back-pressure.
With the widespread adoption of RRLC it is necessary to question the compatibility of the HPLC detector. Presented here is the use of “charged aerosoldetection” (Corona CAD) with conventional HPLC and RRLC. CAD is anevaporative technique and is based on the charging of aerosol-borne analyteparticles by nitrogen gas and on corona discharge, with subsequent measurementof the charge, derived from the charged analyte particles by a high-sensitivityelectrometer. The compatibility ofthe CAD with RRLC is evaluated using the analysis of five phenolic acids as an example.
Using conventional HPLC, the runtime was 7 minutes and thepeak widths were 10.08, 12.18, 12.66, 17.82, and 16.86 seconds. With RRLC, theruntime was 1.5 minutes and the peak widths were 3, 3.18, 3.60, 4.02, and 4.20seconds. Using RRLC reduced the runtime five-fold (~6.5 minutes). The CADshowed that it is fully capable of determining rapid peaks of just 3 seconds atbase. Furthermore, the sensitivity was improved three-fold. The LOD for gallic acidand 4HPAC using HPLC was 13.1 ng and 23 ng. The LOD for gallic acid and 4HPACusing RRLC was 4.3 ng and 8.1 ng. Thedata showed that the CAD is fully compatible with the RRLC, as long as thewidth of analyte peaks is >3 seconds (at base). Improved runtimes and increasedsensitivity were also demonstrated.
A novel mixed-mode reversed-phase and cation exchange HPLCmethod is described to determine four related impurities ofcations, zwitterions, and neutral compounds in developmental drug A simultaneously. Thecommercial column is Primesep 200 containing hydrophobic alkyl chains withembedded acidic groups in H+ form on a silica support. The mobile phasevariables of acid additives, contents of acetonitrile, and concentrations of potassiumchloride have been thoroughly investigated to optimize the separation. Theretention factors as a function of the concentrations of potassium chloride andthe percentages of acetonitrile in the mobile phases are investigated to aninsight into the retention and separation mechanisms of each related impurityand drug A. The study found that the positively charged degradant 1, degradant2, and drug A were retained by both ion-exchange and reversed-phasepartitioning mechanisms. RI2, a small ionic compound, was primarily retained byion exchange. RI4, a neutral compound, was retained through reversed-phasepartitioning without ion exchange. Furthermore, the initial attempt tosimultaneously retain and separate these related impurities and drug A on aconventional RP-HPLC by adjusting the pH of the mobile phases has also beendiscussed. Finally, the method performance characteristics of selectivity,sensitivity, and accuracy have been demonstrated to be suitable to determinethe related impurities in the capsules of drug A.
An isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquidchromatographic (RP-HPLC) method for identification and quantification ofclarithromycin and related substances in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical preparationshas been developed using Prodigy C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μ column withacetonitrile and 0.067 M monobasic potassium phosphate (44:56, v/v) mobilephase adjusted to pH 4 with orthophosphoric acid. Detection was carried outusing photodiode array detector set at 210 nm, with the flow rate of 1 mL/minand column evaporation temperature controlled at 50°C. This method is simple, rapid, selective,and capable of detecting related impurities at trace level in the bulk drug,and pharmaceutical preparations with the detection and quantification limit forthe related substances (impurity A) were found to be 2 and 5 μg, respectively,on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio. The linearity range was found to be within2–100 μg/mL withthe coefficient of correlation of 0.999. The percent recoveries from thepharmaceutical preparations ranged between 98–102%. The methodhas been validated with respect to accuracy, precision, linearity, ruggedness,and limit of detection and quantification.
The determination of traces of inorganic contaminants inconcentrated ionic pharmaceuticals by ion chromatography (IC) requires inlinematrix elimination from the bulk of the pharmaceutical to avoidoverloading of the analytical column. Several methods in a new monograph of theUS Pharmacopeia suggest the use of a rinsing solution consisting of the ICeluent and suitable organic solvents to remove the pharmaceutical from theanalytical column. However, the procedure is tedious and time-consuming, andcannot be automated.
Inline sample preparation is an excellent method for thedetermination of anions and cations in complex pharmaceutical samples. In thispaper, the inline sample preparation technique is applied to the determinationof sodium azide in irbesartan samples. To prevent contamination of theanalytical column, the filtered sample solution is passed through an anionpreconcentration column that retains the azide and the pharmaceutical. Afterthis, the preconcentration column is rinsed with a solution of 70% methanol and30% water to remove the retained pharmaceutical. The rinse solution is passedthrough an anion trap column to remove any anionic impurities.
The method complies with the guidelines of the USFood and Drug Administration (FDA). Reproducibility and recovery are excellentand represent detection limits better than those achieved by direct injectionIC with inline sample preparation. Additionally, the new inline samplepreparation technique can easily be automated.
The water content of medicaments influences the release oftheir active substances as well as their shelf life. Accordingly, the watercontent is an essential parameter that needs to be determined.
Normally, tablets prove hard to dissolve in a Karl Fischerworking media containing alcohol. This means that complicated samplepreparation steps are necessary prior to a water content determination. Thesesteps are time-consuming and can also lead to incorrect results. Thesurface area of the tablet after comminution is much larger so moisture from theatmosphere can be absorbed more easily.
Metrohm has developed a method for determining the watercontent of tablets accurately and without any complicated sample preparationsteps.
When using a high-frequency homogenizer, complicated samplepreparation steps are no longer necessary. The high-frequency homogenizerreduces the tablets to small particles directly in the titration vesselscontaining the KF solution. As the titration vessels are completely sealeduntil the determination starts, atmospheric humidity has no effect on thesample water content.
The use of an automated system considerably reduces theworkload of the user, and is therefore ideal for high sample throughputs. Thesample changers can be adapted to meet all requirements and permit the fullyautomatic determination of the water content of tablets in a way that savesboth time and money. The high-frequency homogenizer can be easily integratedinto the system.
Producing tablets for the pharmaceutical industry includesproving that the active substance content printed on the package is valid forevery single tablet of a batch. Different modern analytical techniques such astitration or ion chromatography are used for the highly accurate quantitation ofthe components. Nevertheless, these analytical techniques are only as good asthe sample preparation preceding them. Substances are dictated by the shape, coating, filling components used, and concentration of the pharmaceutical, differentsample preparation steps have to be carried out before the analysis proper.			
The first step is always the thorough homogenization of thetablet in a suitable solvent mixture. Depending on the determination techniquethat follows filtration, additional dilution or pipetting into new sample vialsis required. In most laboratories these steps are carried out manually, whichcan result in carryover or erratic results as the manual operation isinfluenced by many different circumstances. These steps arevery time-consuming and also the organic solvents used quiteoften present a health hazard.
An automatedsystem that performs every sample preparation in exactly the same way can avoid these problems. Merely,the weighing of the tablets has to be done manually. The content of the activesubstance in a single tablet as well as the product conformity of the wholebatch can be determined with just one automation system. Automation not onlyimproves reproducibility, accuracy and throughput, but also increases laboratory safety.
Numerous pharmaceutical companies are moving towards morereal-time online process control monitoring with the advent of the FDA PATinitiative. Powder analysis has always been a challenge for analyticalchemists. Traditional techniques of drying and solvent operations throughloss-on-drying (LOD) or Karl Fisher (KF) analyses involve removing sample fromthe processes and measurements in a laboratory. LOD and KF are a time-intensive techniques,and therefore dryers must be powered down to avoid the possibility of overshooting thedryness mark.
An online, real-time, and nondestructive technique isrequired for real-time feedback and to enhance process knowledge and control,continuous quality monitoring, measuring all “critical-to-quality” attributes,and also reduced cycle time. Inline FT-NIR is a perfect technology for this type ofapplication.
A case study of an ABB dryer monitor installed intoa dryer to evaluate the feasibility of monitoring moisture during drying runs is presented.
This paper describes a fully customized at-line automationsystem suitable for analyses within a process plant, where analyticaldeterminations to monitor a production process are extremely crucial inachieving constant product quality. Its wide scope of applications includestechniques such as direct measurement (pH, redox potential, conductivity, ISE),potentiometric titration (aqueous and nonaqueous), and Karl Fischer titration,voltammetry, cyclic voltammetric stripping (CVS), and sample preparation. Thesecan be applied to various industries including chemical, petrochemical,electroplating, semiconductor, automotive, steel, pharmaceutical,food/beverage, pulp, and paper industries. ProcessLab's compact and modulardesign, configuration flexibility, and robustness make it ideal for severeconditions prevailing in process plants. The hermetical sealed housings ofwet-part modules and electronic components protect them against dust andsplashes. ProcessLab offers close positioning to a process allowing for rapidand reproducible results, easy installation and operation, networking andprocess integration for easy incorporation into the process surrounding, andeffective data monitoring on-site as well as off-site. It is also expandablefor more analyses at a later time. It is compatible with third-party equipmentand is more economical than online systems. ProcessLab also features analog anddigital input/output signals that can incorporate other process information orsend out information, thus allowing it to react to different input signals,trigger an alarm, or transfer measured values as analog signals. In addition,ProcessLab can be easily integrated into a local network, export data to LIMS,and be fully operated by remote control.
Recently, a special interest has grown within thepharmaceutical industry to develop single enantiomer formulations, andconsequently there is a need for analytical methods to determine theenantiomeric purity of drugs. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC)coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) using polymeric surfactant has greatpotential to serve as a valuable tool for the impurity profiling of chiraldrugs where impurities and degradation products have to be separated from themain compound. In this work, a chiral MEKC-MS of a hydrophobic chiral drug(promethazine log, P = 4.782) was developed using a short eight-carbon-chainpolymeric surfactant (polysodium N-octenoxycarbonyl leucinate, poly-L-SocCL) aschiral selector. The method was first optimized sequentially in terms ofpoly-L-SOcCL, acetonitrile, ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) concentrations, bufferpH, temperature, and voltage, as well as nebulizer pressure. Next multivariateoptimization of the most critical parameters was also performed. Optimalseparation of the promethazine enantiomers was obtained using an electrolytewith 7.5 mM NH4OAc (pH 5.50), 25 mM poly-L-SOcCL, and 55% ACN. Linearity wasachieved using the internal standard method. The limits of detection (LOD) andquantitation (LOQ) were 25 μg/mL and 77 μg/mL, respectively. The validatedmethod was applied for the quality control of promethazine enantiomers incommercially available pharmaceutical formulations. The assay of promethazinetablets showed excellent recovery of 100 ± 0.45%. To assure the methodsuitability for the control of enantiomeric impurities in pharmaceuticalquality control, its precision, repeatability, and robustness will be validatedaccording to the requirements of the International Conference on Harmonization.
An ion chromatography method was developed to analyzecholine hydroxide aqueous solution for choline potency. The method is also ableto detect and quantify related impurities and degradation products whichinclude choline dimer hydroxide, choline trimer hydroxide, and trimethylamine. Optimization of the ion chromatographic method involved the process ofselecting the best combination of analytical column and mobile phase to ensurethe resolution of choline hydroxide from the related impurities anddegradation products with selectivity and sensitivity being the key parameters.The developed IC method was validated; this included linearity, accuracy,precision, intermediate precision, practical detection limit, practicalquantiation limit, lot analysis, standard solution stability, sample solutionstability, robustness for flow rate, and robustness for mobile phasecomposition.
Validation results of the IC method usingDionex CS17 column, Dionex CG17 guard column, and Dionex CSRS-Ultra II 4 mmcation self-regenerating suppressor with conductivity detection are discussed in this paper.The function of the suppressor in the ion chromatography method is to reducethe background conductivity while maximizing the response for the analytecations. The reduction of background conductivity from the eluent translatesinto low noise and hence improved detectability for the analyte cations. Thismethod has practical detection limits of 0.3 (%w/w), 0.01 (%w/w), and 0.01(%w/w) for choline dimer hydroxide, choline trimer hydroxide, and trimethylamine,respectively. The validated IC method for choline hydroxide aqueous methodshowed adequate linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, and accuracy for itsintended use.
The qualification of instruments in a GMP/GLP laboratory isone of the most critical aspects in a compliant environment. The use of aninstrument that is out of compliance invalidates all samples run on thatinstrument. In addition, many laboratories are confronted with an array ofinstruments from different manufacturers, which makes uniform procedures andspecification extremely difficult.
This paper will discuss two products which, when used incombination, canschedule the qualification of an instrument,put the instrument into a “maintenance lock” so that it cannot be used while it is out of qualification,perform the qualification,assess if the procedure passed or failed,automatically route the appropriate documents to laboratory personnel.			
schedule the qualification of an instrument,
put the instrument into a “maintenance lock” so that it cannot be used while it is out of qualification,
perform the qualification,
assess if the procedure passed or failed,
automatically route the appropriate documents to laboratory personnel.
The automated compliance engine (ACE) is a vendor neutralprocedure that can take any qualification specifications and adopt them for theinstrument being tested. The business process manager (BPM) allows metadatafrom the ACE documents to be analyzed. The BPM can then assess whether the ACEprocedure passed or failed, and can then route documents to the appropriatepersonnel. BPM can also take action in the case of a failure to reschedule anACE procedure or, for example, to alert a metrology group to take furtherremedial action. Examples of the ACE procedure and various workflows will bedemonstrated.
Analysis results are often used to check materials againstspecifications or statutory limits. To justify such decisions, it is importantto have a reliability measure of the results, like measurement uncertainty.Therefore, the new ISO/IEC/EN 17025 requires the laboratories to set up andoperate a system for estimating measurement uncertainty. This demands a greateffort from the laboratories. The software UncertaintyManager is the idealsolution for this challenge.
UncertaintyManager implements the full evaluation processaccording to the Eurachem/CITAC guide Quantifying Uncertainty in AnalyticalMeasurement (2nd edition), and fulfills all requirements of the ISO Guideto the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements(Monte Carlo method). The new version 3.0 allows calculating the measurementuncertainty including any type of sample preparation. For this purpose, adatabase with various sample preparation steps was elaborated considering theanalyte characteristics and concentration range. After setting up the operatingsequence of the analytical procedure, UncertaintyManager analyses, of theuncertainty sources in sample preparation, are covered by a recoverycorrection.
UncertaintyManager is the first software to support theanalyst throughout the entire evaluation of measurement uncertainty, and helpsto save tremendous amount of time. The calculation of measurement uncertaintyof chromatographic procedures with extensive sample preparation will bepresented.
Both low- and high-pressure gas-free capillary scaleelectrodialytic generators (EDGs) for eluents in ion chromatography aredescribed. While the low-pressure devices rely on planar or tubular membranes,the high-pressure devices rely on ion exchange beads used as both one-way ionicgates and bail-on-seat valves to provide sealing. The high-pressure device iseasily implemented in the form of a commercial cross-fitting, and can withstandat least 1400 psi. By design, these devices do not produce gas in the eluentchannel; hence it is not necessary to remove gas afterwards. With appropriateelectrolytes and electrode polarities, such devices can produce either acid orbase. The behavior of these devices fullycorresponds to that of a semiconductor diode in regard to ionic transport. Reverse bias can be applied toprevent Donnan-forbidden leakage or ion exchange. Even with 4 M KOH in the electrode compartments and 4 μL/min water flowing through the eluent channel, with sufficient reverse biasapplied, the product KOH concentration can be maintained as low as 30 M,whereas the zero voltage applied concentration, called open circuit penetration(OCP), is 1600 M. It is suggested that this OCP occurs not just throughDonnan-forbidden leakage but perhaps mainly via ion exchange. Chromatogramsand reproducibility data are presented for both isocratic and gradientchromatographies, using ion exchange latex-modified open tubular and packedmonolithic columns.
We believe that it is ironic to continue to use conventionalsample preparation procedures, such as liquid-liquid extraction andultrasonication, for microseparation techniques. A lot of solvents are usedeach time for such procedures, which remain in widespread use. Over the pastfew years, our laboratory has focused on the development of miniaturized andsolvent-minimized extraction methods combined with microseparation analysis. Some of these approaches that have been developed forapplications in the environmental and biological fields will be described. These include single-dropmicroextraction (or solvent microextraction or microdrop liquid-phase microextraction(LPME)), hollow-fiber (HF)-protected LPME, polymer-coated HF microextraction,three-phase (liquid-liquid-liquid) HF LPME, solvent-bar microextraction, continuousflow microextraction, polymer-fiber microextraction, micro-solid phaseextraction,and variants of solid phasemicroextraction. All these methods are easy toimplement, work well, generate good analytical data. They are alsoenvironmentally friendly and chemically sustainable. They are described in thecontext of their combination with microseparation techniques such as gaschromatography, liquid chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis for thedetermination of a wide variety of important analytes.
Microseparation techniques are prone to contamination fromthe sample matrix, when used with real samples. This occurs because smallinterfacial areas are available in these techniques as compared to larger format separations.Therefore, it is important to design efficient sample preparation approacheswhich eliminate interferences and other unwanted matrix components. In the talk,techniques developed in our laboratory based on membranes, coated fibres, andtubes will be discussed. Spot- and time-weighted average sampling andcontinuous monitoring will be discussed.
In pharmaceutical R&D, three questions are consistently asked.(1) Is the expected compound present in the sample? (2) How pure is the sample?(3) How much is in the sample? These questions are particularly relevant earlyin discovery when hundreds of thousands of samples are being assayed and littleis known about each sample. This presentation will describe our approach ofdeveloping optimized instrumentation consisting of sub 3 μm particle HPLC, diodearray UV detection, evaporative light scattering detection, chemiluminesentnitrogen detection, and mass spectrometric detection. To translatethe data from this system into results efficiently, we developed a software platform called“analytical studio.” Combining the optimized instrumentation with automateddata analysis has enabled our lab to efficiently analyze hundreds of thousandsof samples.
In the past few years, the Food and Drug Administration andthe chemical industry have supported an effort to apply process analyticaltechnology (PAT) tools to improve both the control of the manufacturing process and theproduct quality. Near infrared (NIR) is one of the most used techniques toimplement this initiative specifically for the content uniformity (CU)determination of solid dosage forms.
In this study, the performance of NIR multivariatecalibration models generated using partial least-squares (PLS), artificialneural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines' (SVMs) regression iscompared for online content uniformity (CU) determination of pharmaceutical soliddosage forms. PLS is a well-known quantitative approach that utilizes Beer'slaw to linearly correlate measured NIR absorbance spectra with reference sampleconcentrations. However, when dealing with solid samples, where scattering isprominent, the optical path length may vary within a single measurement. Thiscould ultimately cause the relationship between concentration and spectra to benonlinear, hence leading to deviations from Beer's law. In these instances,linear multivariate calibration techniques such as PLS are not optimal for modelingnonlinear relationships.
Measurement of enzyme activity and selectivity at in vivoconcentrations is highly desirable in a range of fields including diagnostics,functional proteomics, and directed evolution. Surface-enhanced resonance Ramanscattering (SERRS) is one of the most sensitive spectroscopic techniques formolecular detection. The approach taken here was to design “masked” enzymesubstrates that did not give an SERRS signal when added to silvernanoparticles. The masked substrates were designed to contain an SERRS activechromophore that was unable to complex to the enhancing metal surface due tolinkage of a substrate through the surface complexing part of the dye. A rangeof substrates and masked dyes were synthesized for use with different enzymeclasses. This allowed comparison of the masking ability of different substratesand the comparison of different dyes and their abilities to act as SERRS enzymeprobes. The enhancing surface used was that of silver nanoparticles whichprovide excellent surface enhancement of Raman scattering and are easy to use.
The next stage in the analytical development of this approach was to establishthe use of the unmasking of the dyes in an assay format. To this end, ELISAassays using an enzyme-conjugated antibody were established for humanC-reactive protein. Calibration curves were obtained for standards to establishthe analytical robustness of the approach, and clinical samples from patientswere also successfully analyzed. In a further advancement of this approach, amultiplexed ELISA using two different SERRS dyes and antigens was successfullydeveloped to demonstrate the versatility and advantages of this technique overconventional ELISAs. This is a significant breakthrough in the use ofSERRS for bioanalysis, and demonstrate the advantages of the technique comparedto those routinely used such as fluorescence.
The automation of solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupledto liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has beendemonstrated using a 96-multi-well plate format, SPME multifiber device, and athree-arm robotic system. This automated configuration is capable of performingall steps of the entire SPME procedure in parallel for all samples, thusdrastically increasing sample throughput compared to other SPME-LC approaches.Extensive optimization of the proposed setup was performed including (1)selection of the best fiber coating, (2) optimization of the fiber coatingprocedure, (3) selection of the best stainless steel support, (4) examinationof the need for fiber preconditioning and/or rinsing, (5) selection of theoptimal calibration method, and (6) confirmation of uniform agitation in allwells. The performance of polydimethylsiloxane and bonded silica (C18 andC16-amide) coatings was compared. The reusability and robustness of both typesof coatings without loss of extraction efficiency were demonstrated for >50uses. However, due to slow kinetics of mass transfer for polydimethylsiloxanecoating, bonded silica fibers were selected for further use. The optimizedautomated SPME-LC-MS/MS platform was subsequently fully validated for thehigh-throughput analysis of diazepam, nordiazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam inhuman whole blood. The proposed method allowed the automated analysis of>200 samples per day, while achieving excellent accuracy and precision. Thisrepresents the highest throughput of any SPME technique proposed to date.Finally, an automated ligand-receptor binding study investigating the bindingbetween diazepam and human serum albumin is reported.
Consumer interest in botanical products as dietarysupplements has grown intensely because of their medicinal properties. Forexample, Ephedrae herba (Ma-Huang) is used in traditional Chinesemedicine to reduce fever and treat cough and asthma. Thevalidation of a high-performance liquid chromatography-particle beam massspectrometry method (HPLC-PB/MS) with interchangeable electron impact (EI) andglow discharge (GD) ionization sources is described for the analysis of botanical extracts.More specifically, the proposed method was validated for the analysis of theephedrine alkaloids using ephedra-containing dietary supplement standardreference materials (SRMs) 3241 Ephedra Sinica Stapf Native Extract and 3242Ephedra Sinica Stapf Commercial Extract from NIST.
The ephedrine alkaloids were separatedby reversed-phase chromatography using a phenyl column at room temperature. A linear gradient method with amobile phase composition varying from 5:95 methanol: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid(TFA) in water to 20:80 MeOH: 0.1% TFA in water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min withanalysis times of less than 20 minutes, separation was monitored by absorbanceat 254 nm. Detailed evaluation of the primary controlling parameters forthe EI source (electron energy and source block temperature) and the GD source(discharge pressure and current) was performed to determine the optimaloperating conditions by monitoring the intensities and the fragmentationpatterns of the ephedrine alkaloids. Ephedrine and N-methylephedrine were takenas a representative of the test alkaloids. The eluting analytes are introducedinto the particle beam interface to undergo nebulization and desolvation.Subsequently, dry analyte particles reach the ion source where they undergovaporization and ionization. Previous studies have shown that the glowdischarge ion source provides similar molecular fragmentation electron impactof each eluting compound; therefore a comparison between the EI and GD massspectra acquired was feasible. The ephedrine alkaloids present in the SRMs werequantified by a standard addition method. Limits of detection in the single-nanogramlevel were achieved. It is believed that the HPLC-PB/MS method with EI and GDion sources is a viable technique for the analysis and characterization ofcommercial extracts as well as regulatory compliance and quality control.
Forced degradation is one of the critical activities duringdrug development within the pharmaceutical industry. According to FDA ICHguidelines Q3B(R2), forced degradation studies are used for several purposes:(1) development and validation of stability-indicating methods to demonstratespecificity of separation methods as well as to gain some insight into thedegradation pathways; (2) discernment of degradation products in formulationsthat are related to drug substances versus those that are related to nondrugsubstances; (3) helping facilitate formulation development, manufacturingprocesses, and packaging.
The FDA guidance on forced degradation is vague with respectto experimental conditions, and much of the detail for the investigations isleft up to the pharmaceutical researcher. Even within Merck, forced degradationstudies are performed using experimental conditions that vary from scientist toscientist and from site to site. In order to harmonize the procedures of forceddegradation, a novel idea was proposed to automate forced degradation studiesby the application of a laboratory automation tool.
The automated forced degradation approach has significantlyreduced the amount of labor spent on manually performing tests, and harmonizesthe operational procedures of forced degradation throughout Merck ResearchLaboratories. Ultimately, this technology has become a general platformapproach to the method validation and stability testing workflow that has beenutilized at remote sites and in other departments throughout Merck. Theautomated system is user-friendly, and is intended to be used as a“walk-up system” that is able to prepare forced degradation andlinearity samples, to perform online HPLC analysis, as well as to generatereports automatically. The details of the system will be discussed along with anumber of case studies demonstrating its use.
Biomolecules play important roles in physiologicalactivities of most natural systems. In this study, we demonstrated thatidentification and quantitative determination of biomolecules, typicallypresent at very low concentrations in complex mixtures, could be achieved bythe combination of single-molecule nanopore stochastic sensing with patternrecognition technique. In stochastic sensing, individual binding events aredetected as transient blockades with sub-milli-second time resolution byrecording the ionic current driven through a single nanopore at a fixedtransmembrane potential. This approach reveals both the concentration and theidentity of an analyte: the former from the frequency of occurrence of thebinding events and the latter by its characteristic current signature,typically the dwell time of the analyte coupled with the extent of currentblock (amplitude) it creates. With an array of protein channels engineered withdifferent functional groups, a pattern-recognition mechanism may additionallybe used to differentiate one compound from the other. This can also achieve simultaneousdetection of the individual components present in a complex mixture based onthe collective responses of analytes towards individual component nanoporesthrough reversal binding interactions. Our results show that a variety ofpeptides and DNA molecules, including those differing by one amino acid, can bedifferentiated using the pattern-recognition nanopore technique. An automated Nanopresensing technique offerspotential as a laboratory tool for routine sensor applications.
