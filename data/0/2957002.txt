SERUM PROLACTIN LEVEL AND SEVERITY OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY IN PATIENTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA

Serum prolactin level was measured in 20 male and 11 female drug naive patients of schizophrenia Subsequently, these patients were treated with antipsychotics and ECTs. The severity of psychopathology at the baseline rind subsquent improvement at the end of 3 weeks and 6 weeks was assessed on modifies brief asychiatric rating scale (BPRS).
Contrary to the expectations, a two fold increase in serum prolactin level was observed in drug naive male and female patients of schizophrenia The difference was found to be statictically significant in males No correlation was observed between the baseline serum prolactin level and the severity of baseline psychopathology and subsequent improvement in psychopathology at the end of 3 weeks and 6 weeks From the present study it seems that baseline serum prolactine level in drug naive patients of schizophrenia may not be a reliable indicator of psychopathology and prognosis.
