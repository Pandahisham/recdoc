Quetiapine monotherapy for bipolar depression

Bipolar depression is more common, disabling, and difficult-to-treat than the                    manic and hypomanic phases that define bipolar disorder. Unlike the treatment of                    so-called “unipolar” depressions, antidepressants generally are                    not indicated as monotherapies for bipolar depressions and recent studies                    suggest that -even when used in combination with traditional mood stabilizers                    – antidepressants may have questionable value for bipolar depression. The                    current practice is that mood stabilizers are initiated first as monotherapies;                    however, the antidepressant efficacy of lithium and valproate is modest at best.                    Within this context the role of atypical antipsychotics is being evaluated. The                    combination of olanzapine and the antidepressant fluoxetine was the first                    treatment to receive regulatory approval in the US specifically for bipolar I                    depression. Quetiapine was the second medication to be approved for this                    indication, largely as the result of two pivotal trials known by the acronyms of                    BOLDER (BipOLar DEpRession) I and II. Both studies demonstrated that two doses                    of quetiapine (300 mg and 600 mg given once daily at bedtime) were significantly                    more effective than placebo, with no increased risk of patients switching into                    mania. Pooling the two studies, quetiapine was effective for both bipolar I and                    bipolar II depressions and for patients with (and without) a history of rapid                    cycling. The two doses were comparably effective in both studies. Although the                    efficacy of quetiapine monotherapy has been established, much additional                    research is necessary. Further studies are needed to more fully investigate                    dose-response relationships and comparing quetiapine monotherapy to other mood                    stabilizers (lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine) in bipolar depression, both                    singly and in combination. Head-to-head studies are needed comparing quetiapine                    to the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination. Longer-term studies are needed to                    confirm the persistence of response and to better gauge effects on metabolic                    profiles across months of therapy. A prospective study of patients specifically                    seeking treatment for rapid cycling and those with a history of                    treatment-emergent affective shifts also is needed. Despite the caveats, as                    treatment guidelines are revised to incorporate new data, the efficacy and                    tolerability of quetiapine monotherapy must be given serious consideration.

Bipolar disorder is a highly recurrent and not infrequently chronic illness that is                recognized as one of the world’s 10 greatest public health problems (Murray and Lopez 1997). For the majority of                patients, the periods of depression far exceed those of mania, in terms of both                frequency and duration (Post et al 2003;                    Judd et al 2002, 2003). For individuals with bipolar I disorder, for example,                days spent with depressive symptoms are about three times more common than days                spent with hypomanic or manic symptoms (Judd et al                    2002). The dominance of the depressed pole of the illness is even more                dramatic individuals with bipolar II disorder: in one prospective study conducted                across nearly 13 years, patients with bipolar II disorder spent almost 40 times the                days with depressive symptoms as compared to the days spent with hypomanic symptoms                    (Judd et al 2003).
Despite the dramatic and life-disrupting nature of mania, recent studies have also                documented that it is the more long-lasting depressive episodes that have the                greater deleterious effects on quality of life and functionality (Judd et al 2005; Depp et al 2006). The burden imposed by bipolar depression on the family                and loved ones exceeds that of bipolar mania or unipolar depression, perhaps all the                more remarkable in view of the greater risk of psychosis, violent behaviour, and                increased frequency of hospitalization associated with mania (Post 2005; Hirschfeld                    2004). The perceived stigma of the condition may also add to the burden                placed on the family or primary caregiver (Perlick                    et al 2004). The assessment of caregiver burden is further impeded by the                unique characteristics of bipolar depression – including the unfortunate                tendency for milder episodes to go unrecognized or untreated and the high incidence                of subsyndromal inter-episode symptoms (Ogilvie et                    al 2005). Perhaps not surprisingly, the depressive episodes also are more                directly linked to reduced longevity in bipolar disorder, particularly through                suicide but perhaps also to increased risks of obesity and cardiovascular disease                    (Dilsaver et al 1997; Fagiolini et al                2002; Mitchell and Malhi 2004).
Despite the obvious clinical importance of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder,                remarkably few controlled studies of first- and second-line treatments have been                performed (Thase 2005). The paucity of                well-designed studies essentially precludes the practice of evidence-based medicine                and for some important questions (eg, “If an antidepressant is used and                appears to be effective, how long should it be maintained?”) there is not                consensus about best practices, which no doubt hampers clinical decision-making                    (Thase 2005; Ostacher 2006). Indeed, in the largest placebo-controlled study                of the role of antidepressants in bipolar depression conducted to date, the addition                of paroxetine or bupropion to optimized therapy with mood stabilizers resulted in no                added benefit as compared to therapy with mood stabilizers alone (Sachs et al 2007). For the prescribing                physician, the need to swiftly deliver effective pharmacotherapy to lessen suffering                and minimize functional impairments is paramount, and appears to foster the                continued use of antidepressants in bipolar depression despite the lack of clear-cut                evidence that they improve outcomes. Nevertheless, the decision to initiate therapy                with an antidepressant to hasten recovery is not without attendant risks, including                treatment-emergent affective switches (TEAS) or acceleration of cycling and, as a                result, the ranking of antidepressants in contemporary practice guidelines continues                to drop in favor of other strategies (Thase                    2005; Yatham et al 2006).
Many expert panels recommend initiating mood stabilizers alone, ie, before                considering whether or not an antidepressant is indicated. If one accepts the                validity of the “mood stabilizer first” strategy, then lithium and                three anticonvulsants (valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine) might be nominated                as candidates for first line of therapy for bipolar depression (Thase 2005; Grunze 2005). However, none of these medications is renowned for having                powerful antidepressant effects (Thase 2005)                and – primarily for reasons of tolerability and safety – few                clinicians would use carbamazepine as the first step in a treatment algorithm. Even                lithium salts, which arguably have the best evidence of efficacy from                placebo-controlled studies (Zornberg and Pope                    1993; Thase and Sachs 2000), do not exert particularly robust                antidepressant effects (Thase 2005). The                search for an effective monotherapy for bipolar depression thus goes on.
Emerging data suggest that the list of medications that are classified as mood                stabilizers eventually may need to be expanded to include the class of medications                known as atypical antipsychotics. All five of the more widely prescribed atypical                antipsychotics (in alphabetical order: aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine,                risperidone, and ziprasidone) have established antimanic efficacy. Consistent with                proposed criteria to define mood stabilizers (see, for example, Ketter and Calabrese 2002; Goodwin and Malhi 2007), atypical                antipsychotics are unlikely to cause TEAS and two members of the class (olanzapine                and aripiprazole) have received a formal indication for prophylaxis against manic                relapse following successful acute therapy. Starting with observations from studies                that included patients with mixed manic states, there is slowly increasing evidence                to indicate that atypical antipsychotics also have antidepressant effects (Keck 2005; Nemeroff 2005). In fact, the first treatment to be approved by the                United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for bipolar depression                is the proprietary combination of olanzapine and the selective serotonin reuptake                inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine. In the pivotal trials that led to that indication,                olanzapine monotherapy was also studied and found to have intermediate efficacy:                greater than placebo but significantly less than the olanzapine-fluoxetine                combination (OFC) (Tohen et al 2003).
This review will focus on the second atypical antipsychotic to be systematically                studied as a monotherapy for bipolar depression, quetiapine. The results of the                research program that led to the FDA approval of quetiapine monotherapy for bipolar                depression will be summarized in detail. Quetiapine, which is the first – and                currently only – monotherapy approved by the FDA to treat both the depressive                and manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder, has been ranked as a first-line                treatment of bipolar depression in the recently updated treatment guidelines                published by the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) (Yatham et al 2006).
Regulatory approval of quetiapine monotherapy for bipolar depression was primarily                based on two similar randomized controlled trials (RCTs) known by the acronyms                BOLDER (BipOLar DEpRession) I and II. Both of these 8-week, placebo-controlled,                double-blind studies compared two doses of quetiapine – 300 mg per day and                600 mg per day. Both studies used once daily dosing (at bedtime) and the same rapid                titration schedule, with maximum study dose achieved by the 8th day of treatment.                Both studies included patients with bipolar I and bipolar II depressive episodes and                allowed otherwise eligible patients with histories of rapid cycling to enroll. Both                studies used change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)                total score as the primary endpoint. Together, the BOLDER I (Calabrese et al 2005) and BOLDER II (Thase et al 2006) studies represent the largest                placebo-controlled data set to date that includes patients with bipolar I and                bipolar II depressions.
BOLDER I enrolled 542 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for a current episode of                bipolar I or bipolar II depression, according to DSM-IV criteria (Calabrese et al 2005). In order to enter the                study, outpatients had to score at least 20 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale                (HAM-D17), as well as have a score of at least 2 on HAM-D item 1 (depressed mood).                Pretreatment MADRS scores indicated that the unmedicated study group presented with                moderate-to-severe levels of depressive symptoms (see, for example, Muller et al 2003).
Both doses of quetiapine resulted in significant improvements in MADRS total scores                at all time points measured, with statistical significance over placebo detected                after only 1 week of treatment (the first assessment point of the study) and                maintained at every time point thereafter (see Figure 1a). The proportion of patients classified as responders to                treatment, defined as a ≥50% improvement in MADRS total score at study                endpoint (using the “last observation carried forward [LOCF]                convention” to estimate the final scores of study dropouts) was significantly                higher in both groups receiving active quetiapine (58% in both groups) than in the                group randomized to placebo (36%). Remission rates (defined as a final MADRS total                score ≤12) followed a similar pattern (53% for both 300 mg and 600 mg                quetiapine, 28% for placebo). Individuals treated with either dose of quetiapine                were faster to respond to treatment and to achieve remission than those receiving                placebo (median time to response was 22 days for both doses of quetiapine versus 36                days for placebo, and median times to remission were 29, 27, and 65 days for 300 mg                quetiapine, 600 mg quetiapine, and placebo, respectively).
Least-squares mean change from baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg                        Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at each assessment of                        outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder who experienced a major depressive                        episode (BOLDER I).
The results of the BOLDER II trial (n = 509) fully replicated the first study                in terms of the primary outcome variable, with quetiapine-treated patients                displaying significantly greater mean improvement in MADRS total scores than                placebo-treated patients at all time points from Week 1 onward (Figure 1b) (Thase et al                    2006). Response rates for both doses of quetiapine monotherapy were also                similar to those observed in the original study after 8 weeks of treatment (60%,                58%, and 45% for the 300 mg, 600 mg, and placebo groups, respectively), as were                remission rates (52% for both groups receiving active quetiapine as compared to 37%                for the group receiving placebo). Looking across the two studies, the only                appreciable difference was the higher placebo response/remission rates observed in                BOLDER II, which could possibly be attributable to increased expectations from                physicians and patients alike, in light of the positive findings arising from BOLDER                I.
Least-squares mean change from baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg                        Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at each assessment of                        outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder who experienced a major depressive                        episode (BOLDER II).
In both BOLDER studies, improvements on the secondary rater-administered measure, the                    HAM-D17, mirrored those reported on the MADRS scale. For example,                both groups receiving active quetiapine again experienced significantly greater mean                improvements from Week 1 onward compared with the group receiving placebo.
With respect to the impact of quetiapine on specific depressive symptoms, at study                endpoint improvements were detected in nine of the 10 individual items in BOLDER I,                and in nine individual items in BOLDER II. Figure                    2 summarizes improvements in individual items of the MADRS scale in the                BOLDER studies. It is important to note that significant improvements were observed                on the core symptoms of depression, including apparent sadness, reported sadness,                suicidal thoughts, and pessimistic thoughts, in addition to improvements in sleep                and anxiety.
Percentage improvement from baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression                        Rating Scale (MADRS) individual items scores in outpatients with bipolar I                        or II disorder (data pooled from BOLDER I and BOLDER II studies; ITT,                        LOCF).
Since the patient populations enrolled in the BOLDER studies included individuals                with both bipolar I and bipolar II depression, and those with and without a                rapid-cycling disease course, the results of the BOLDER trials were examined to                determine if quetiapine was particularly effective – or ineffective –                in various patient subgroups. Although there are important differences between                bipolar I and bipolar II disorders (as well as between patients who meet criteria                for rapid cycling and those who do not) (Yatham et                    al 2005), demonstration that a novel treatment is comparably effective                across the subgroups could greatly simplify clinical management. The combined BOLDER                data set shows that both bipolar I and bipolar II patient groups exhibited                significant improvements in MADRS total score following treatment with either dose                of quetiapine (300 mg per day or 600 mg per day) compared with placebo (Figure 3).
Least mean squares change from baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg                        Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score in outpatients with bipolar I or                        II disorder (data pooled from BOLDER I and BOLDER II studies; ITT,                        LOCF).
Rapid cycling is associated with a poorer treatment response and long-term prognosis,                and is associated with greater disability and a higher incidence of suicidal                behavior (Schneck 2006). Currently available                antidepressants may increase the risk of rapid cycling, and this uncertainty has                limited their widespread use (Goldberg and Truman                    2003). Results of a subanalysis of BOLDER I indicated that quetiapine was                as effective in patients with a history of rapid cycling as among with less frequent                episodes (Vieta et al 2007). A not yet                published analysis of the combined data from the BOLDER studies echoed this result                and demonstrated the broad applicability of quetiapine treatment by revealing a                similar improvement in MADRS total scores in both patients with or without rapid                cycling (Figure 4). As many experts consider                antidepressants to be relatively contraindicated in rapid cycling because of an                extremely high incidence of TEAS, the antidepressant activity of quetiapine could be                partly offset if therapeutic response was associated with increased cycling or the                induction of hypomania/mania. It is thus noteworthy that the rapid cycling patients                treated with quetiapine in BOLDER I and BOLDER II were no more likely to develop                hypomania or mania than were patients receiving placebo. Although patients were also                assessed for signs/symptoms of treatment-emergent mood elevation with the Young                Mania Rating Scale, to date results on this measure have not been reported.                Nevertheless, as described below, the proportion of patients developing diagnosable                episodes of hypomania or mania was actually higher among those treated with placebo                than those receiving active quetiapine.
Least mean squares change from baseline in Montgomery-Åsberg                        Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score in outpatients with bipolar I or                        II disorder and rapid or non-rapid cycling (data pooled from BOLDER I and                        BOLDER II studies; ITT, LOCF).
Anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with bipolar disorder and may predispose                individuals to intensified symptoms, substance abuse, hospitalization, and suicide                ideations (Gaudiano and Miller 2005; Keller 2006; McIntyre et al 2006). A cross-sectional sample from 500 individuals with                bipolar I or II disorder enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program                for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) indicated that comorbid anxiety disorders, which were                identified in over half of the sample, had a large and negative impact on role                functioning and quality of life (Simon et al                    2004a). The patient’s response to treatment can be dampened by                comorbid anxiety (Frank et al 2002; Gaudiano and Miller 2005), making                pharmacotherapy a challenge. Despite the high comorbidity, many patients with                bipolar disorder and a coexisting anxiety disorder do not receive appropriately                tailored drug therapy. In the STEP-BD population mentioned above, only 59% reported                pharmacotherapy use meeting criteria for “minimally adequate” mood                stabilizer, regardless of comorbid diagnoses, rapid cycling, or bipolar I or II                status (Simon et al 2004b). Moreover, even                though anticonvulsants may have some utility for patients with comorbid anxiety,                such patients are less responsive to therapy than non-anxious patients (Henry et al 2003). Given the paucity of                existing data and the clear need for improved treatment options in this patient                subset, it was important to examine the effect of quetiapine monotherapy on anxiety                symptoms in the BOLDER studies.
In the BOLDER I study, mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis of                anxiety symptoms, as rated on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A),                revealed that quetiapine monotherapy was associated with a rapid and pronounced                improvement across individual and combined quetiapine treatment groups compared with                placebo (−10.3 versus −6.7 for combined quetiapine and placebo groups,                respectively), irrespective of baseline severity of depression (Hirschfeld et al 2006). Improvements were seen                in eight of the 14 individual items on the HAM-A scale, which included the core                items of “anxious mood” (−1.1 versus −0.5, respectively;                p < 0.001)and “tension” (−1.1 versus −0.6                respectively; p < 0.001). This improvement was replicated in the BOLDER II                study, in terms of both magnitude and significance (Thase et al 2006).
Improvement in anxiety symptoms was observed in the subgroup of bipolar I patients in                BOLDER I, in which HAM-A total score was significantly improved compared with                placebo at Week 8 (−10.4 versus −5.1 points, for combined quetiapine                and placebo groups, respectively; p < 0.001) (Hirschfeld et al 2006). Within the smaller subset of patients with                bipolar II disorder, patients treated with active quetiapine or placebo showed                comparable improvement in HAM-A total score (−9.8 versus −9.0,                respectively). Results from subgroup analyses from the BOLDER II trial and the                pooled data set, not yet available, will be helpful in clarifying this unexpected                finding.
Sleep disturbance is a relatively common occurrence in psychiatric patients, with                    insomnia presenting as a primary symptom in 30%–90% of psychiatric                    disorders. (Becker 2006)Again, the BOLDER                    I study was the first to explore the impact of quetiapine monotherapy on sleep,                    using the Pittsburgh questionnaire (PSQI) to rate quality of sleep. The PSQI is                    a 24-item questionnaire that includes 19 self-rated and 5 items rated by the                    patient’s bed partner. The instrument is used to study sleep quality,                    latency, duration, efficiency, use of medication, and daytime dysfunction, and                    assesses sleep quality and disturbance in the preceding month.
In BOLDER I, participants showed moderate-to-severe sleep disruption at baseline                    according to the PSQI. At last assessment, quality of sleep had improved                    significantly following treatment with either dose of quetiapine compared with                    placebo (p < 0.001) (Endicott et al                        2007). Mean values for quality of sleep, sleep latency, and sleep                    duration were 0.5–0.7 points lower in quetiapine-treated patients than in                    placebo-treated patients (Endicott et al                        2007).
To date, dedicated quality-of-life studies in individuals with bipolar disorder                    are relatively sparse, although a number of ongoing studies are attempting to                    redress this imbalance in response to increased recognition that recovery should                    be marked by a return to an acceptable quality of life and improved                    functionality for the patient (Michalak et al                        2005; Mitchell et al 2006;                        Kasper 2004). The depressive                    component of bipolar disorder is thought to be more detrimental to quality of                    life than the manic component (Vojta et al                        2001). Furthermore, the degree of functional impairment and loss of                    work productivity experienced by individuals with bipolar depression exceeds                    that experienced by patients with unipolar depression (Vornik and Hirschfeld 2005). There is also evidence to                    suggest that the delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis experienced by many                    individuals with bipolar depression may further impact the quality of life they                    are able to enjoy since early and appropriate intervention can drastically                    enhance not only the symptomatic but also the subjective experience of                    individuals over the long term (Kasper                        2004).
Thus, any efficacious medication that can also exert positive effects on quality                    of life in bipolar depression is of obvious therapeutic value. Positive effects                    on health-related quality of life may be intrinsically linked with general                    tolerability. If a treatment is well-tolerated, a patient will be more likely to                    become satisfied with his treatment regimen. The superiority and increasing                    popularity of the atypical antipsychotics over the more conventional                    antipsychotics may derive from their improved tolerability (Vornik and Hirschfeld 2005).
The BOLDER I study was the first large-scale investigation of quetiapine                    monotherapy in bipolar depression to report quality of life as a secondary                    endpoint (Endicott et al 2007). Both                    BOLDER studies used the short-form version of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and                    Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) to evaluate the impact of quetiapine on                    health-related quality of life. This version rates 16 items (physical health;                    mood; work; household activities; social relationships; family relationships;                    leisure-time activity; ability to function in daily life; sexual drive, interest                    and/or performance; economic status; living/housing situation; ability to get                    around physically without feeling dizzy or unsteady or falling; vision in terms                    of ability to work or do hobbies; overall sense of well-being; medications; and                    overall life satisfaction and contentment during the past week) on a 5-point                    scale.
Consistent with their disease profile, BOLDER participants scored poorly on                    quality-of-life scores at baseline. Following 8 weeks of treatment with                    quetiapine, significant improvements in Q-LES-Q total score were evident in both                    BOLDER studies (Calabrese et al 2005;                        Thase et al 2006; Endicott et al 2007). In BOLDER I, for                    example, mean Q-LES-Q percentage maximum scores at final assessment (LOCF) were                    57.6, 57.4, and 48.1 points for 300 mg quetiapine, 600 mg quetiapine, and                    placebo, respectively (Endicott et al                        2007). The improvements were significantly greater in both quetiapine                    groups compared with placebo (p < 0.001) at final assessment.                    Interestingly, quality-of-life improvements were positively linked with MADRS                    response and remission status. If a patient responded to quetiapine treatment,                    quality of life also improved, whereas MADRS non-response was associated with                    negligible improvement in quality of life.
The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), introduced as an additional outcome measure                    for BOLDER II, quantified the impact of quetiapine on the interrelated domains                    of work, social life, and family life/home life/responsibilities. At the last                    assessment, the mean improvements in SDS scores from baseline were −7.3,                    −7.9, and −6.0 for 300 mg quetiapine, 600 mg quetiapine, and                    placebo, respectively (p < 0.05 for 600 mg quetiapine versus placebo)                        (Thase et al 2006).
Good tolerability, as rated by physicians and patients alike, is integral to the                success of any medication strategy. As tolerability and treatment adherence tend to                worsen as each new drug is added to a complex pharmacotherapy regimen, a                well-tolerated monotherapy would be expected to have multiple advantages. (Burton et al 2005)Quetiapine monotherapy was                generally well-tolerated in the BOLDER studies. As detailed safety/tolerability data                were presented in the source publications, (Calabrese                    et al 2005; Thase et al 2006)only                a brief summary follows below.
In the BOLDER studies, the proportions of quetiapine-treated patients completing                    the full 8 week treatment protocol was similar to that reported for placebo and                    ranged between 53% and 67%. The most common reasons for discontinuation were                    withdrawal of consent, adverse events, loss to follow-up, and lack of perceived                    efficacy, with attrition due to AEs more common among the patients receiving                    active medication and dropouts due to lack of efficacy more common in the                    placebo groups. None of the serious AEs reported in either BOLDER study was                    considered to have been drug-related.
The majority of AEs were mild-to-moderate in intensity and transient in nature.                    The most common adverse events experienced by 5% or more of patients receiving                    quetiapine in both BOLDER studies were dry mouth, sedation, somnolence,                    dizziness, and constipation (Table 1;                    pooled data from BOLDER I and II). Trends in tolerability tended to favor the                    group receiving the lower (300 mg per day) dose, although few of these                    differences were statistically significant.
Most common adverse events associated with quetiapine treatment in                            outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder (≥5% patients; data                            pooled from BOLDER I and BOLDER II studies)
Weight gain in the BOLDER studies was greater among the patients receiving active                    quetiapine. Across studies, the pooled weight-gain data showed a mean increase                    of 1.2 kg in the quetiapine 300 mg per day group and 1.5 kg in the 600 mg per                    day group, as compared with a gain of 0.2 kg in the placebo group. A weight                    increase of greater than 7% was observed in 7.1% of patients receiving the 300                    mg/day dose of quetiapine, 10.0% receiving the 600 mg/day dose of quetiapine,                    and 2.4% of those receiving placebo.
The weight gain associated with some atypical antipsychotics may often be                    accompanied by deleterious changes in serum lipids and increases in fasting                    glucose, both of which increase the risk for coronary artery disease. It is                    important to note that in the BOLDER trials, the mean change in fasting glucose                    and lipids with quetiapine was not statistically significantly different to that                    with placebo.
As discussed previously, the risk of precipitating a manic episode is a major                    concern when treating bipolar depression with traditional antidepressants.                    Treatment-emergent mania affects 20%–40% of individuals with bipolar                    disorder receiving long-term antidepressant therapy (Goldberg and Truman 2003). Since combination therapy may                    reduce the risk of treatment-emergent mania, this is often the treatment                    approach preferred by many psychiatrists (Grunze                        2005). Therefore, when assessing the tolerability profile of a single                    agent, it is important to establish the propensity for manic switch.
Data from the BOLDER studies showed a low incidence of treatment-emergent mania                    with quetiapine and placebo. Treatment-emergent mania was defined as an adverse                    event of mania or hypomania, or Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score ≥16                    on any two consecutive visits or at the final visit. Data pooled from BOLDER I                    and II reveal that the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent manic                    symptoms was greater in the placebo group (5.2%) compared with both quetiapine                    treatment groups (both 2.9%).
Historically, the atypical antipsychotics have been associated with a reduced                    risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) within the recommended dose ranges                    compared with their conventional counterparts (Pierre 2005). This highly desirable characteristic is thought to                    derive directly from their mechanism of action, specifically by less avid                    binding to post-synaptic dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia (Seeman 2002; Tort et al 2006).
In the BOLDER trials, no individual specific EPS had an incidence greater than 5%                    among patients receiving quetiapine and the rate of discontinuation due to EPS                    was also low. The incidence of the abnormal involuntary movements that were                    considered to be EPS was 12.0% with quetiapine 300 mg per day, 11.5% with                    quetiapine 600 mg per day, and 5.5% with placebo. Mean changes in scores from                    rating scales used to assess EPS, the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes                    Akathisia Rating Scale, were low in the quetiapine treatment groups and were                    similar to those reported for placebo.
One significant limitation of the BOLDER studies is that they were limited to only 8                weeks of double-blind therapy and patients were withdrawn from study medication at                the completion of the study. In clinical practice, an effective monotherapy of                bipolar depression would typically be maintained indefinitely for prophylaxis. To                date, the long-term effects of quetiapine in bipolar depression have only been                assessed in a small open-label study (Milev et al                    2006), and with quetiapine (at doses up to 800 mg/day) being used in                combination with ongoing antidepressant or mood stabilizing therapy. A naturalistic                12-month study in 17 patients revealed a mean reduction in baseline HAM-D total                score of 55.5% LOCF following the addition of quetiapine to the existing treatment                regimen (Milev et al 2006). The proportion of                patients (n =13) achieving a 50% reduction in HAM-D17 total score                was high, at 76.5%. Although these preliminary data are encouraging, larger                controlled studies are required to extend these long-term findings and to examine                the long-term effects of quetiapine monotherapy in particular. Maintenance studies                with quetiapine in bipolar disorder are currently under analysis. The impact of                longer term quetiapine therapy on weight and other metabolic indices will be of                considerable interest.
Another limitation of the BOLDER studies is that neither study included an active                comparator. Now that efficacy has been established, comparative studies are needed,                both versus conventional mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate, and the                olanzapine – fluoxetine combination (OFC) (the only other treatment strategy                now approved for treatment of bipolar depression). Some would argue that                head-to-head comparisons versus lamotrigine also are needed. Although the acute                phase efficacy of lamotrigine has not yet been established by a series of                unequivocally positive RCTs, it is widely used by clinicians for treatment of both                bipolar I and bipolar II depression and there is, at the least, evidence suggestive                of efficacy in the literature (Calabrese et al                    1999; Frye et al 2000). In the                only study to directly compare lamotrigine and OFC, trends favoured the latter drug                on efficacy measures, although tolerability indices clearly favoured lamotrigine                    (Brown et al 2006). In addition to studies                of quetiapine as a monotherapy, its utility in combination with other relevant                therapies, both antidepressants and conventional mood stabilizers, warrant                evaluation.
There is currently a lack of consensus surrounding the label “mood                stabilizer,” but generally, if an agent shows efficacy in treating both acute                manic and depressive symptoms and is also effective in the prevention of                recurrences, it can be considered as such (Bauer and                    Mitchner 2004; Goodwin and Malhi                    2007). Currently, no one treatment adequately fulfills the                “ideal” mood stabilizer criteria, although the popular view is that                lithium comes closest to doing so (Sachs                2005). The emergence of quetiapine, with its bimodal activity against bipolar                mania and depression, may qualify as a mood stabilizer in its own right (Vieta 2005; Sachs 2005).
The defining criteria for a mood stabilizer mentioned earlier omit other desirable                characteristics like good tolerability, which tend to become more relevant once                efficacy has been established (Bauer and Mitchner                    2004). Clearly, if a treatment is well tolerated, then adherence, quality                of life, and caregiver benefits will also improve. So if the antidepressant efficacy                of quetiapine derived from BOLDER and its proven ability in improving manic symptoms                from earlier studies place quetiapine monotherapy in a strong position as a                potential mood stabilizer, its tolerability profile is favorable enough to permit                first line use if syndromal severity is sufficient to justify prescription of an                atypical antipsychotic. The low rate of treatment-emergent mania gives quetiapine an                obvious advantage over the combination of a mood stabilizer and a traditional                antidepressant. Nevertheless, the strong performance of quetiapine in patients with                a history of rapid cycling observed in the BOLDER studies does warrant prospective                replication before this medication can truly be considered a treatment of choice for                this clinically challenging presentation of bipolar disorder. Although longer-term                data in bipolar disorder are needed, results of the BOLDER studies are reassuring                that a large majority of patients will not gain a meaningful amount of weight during                acute-phase therapy. Accompanying quetiapine-induced improvements in quality of                sleep, functionality, and health-related quality of life will impact not only the                patient, but the family members or caregivers who surround them. Ultimately,                caregiver perception and not just patient perception will dictate the success of                quetiapine as a mood-stabilizing treatment option. Dedicated studies in this area                are awaited with interest.
The BOLDER studies demonstrated that two doses of quetiapine monotherapy – 300                mg and 600 mg – prescribed at bedtime were rapidly effective and generally                well tolerated in bipolar depression. The antidepressant efficacy of quetiapine was                found in both bipolar I and bipolar II depression and extended to patients with high                levels of anxiety as well as those with a history of rapid cycling. Quetiapine was                also associated with significant improvements in health-related quality of life,                improvements that were intrinsically linked to its antidepressant efficacy.                Comparative trials are now needed to help to rank quetiapine therapy among the group                of other widely regarded first-line options, and long-term data from controlled                studies of patients treated for bipolar depression are also needed to ensure that                these effects are durable and that tolerability is acceptable across months or even                years of therapy.
