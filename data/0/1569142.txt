Historical and modern epidemiological studies on populations exposed to N-substituted aryl compounds.

The historical exposures to aromatic amines of various occupational groups are briefly reviewed. Modern studies indicate that other occupational groups might have risks worth investigating; these include machinists and workers in the chemical industry. Details of a recent investigation into the exposure of dye workers are given which indicate a lowered risk in recent years since the introduction of safety measures. Nonoccupational exposures to the aromatic amines are also discussed. They include cigarette smoking and phenacetin abuse, the former being a potent causal agent in bladder cancer.
