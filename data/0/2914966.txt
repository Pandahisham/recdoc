Sodium (1R,2S,5S)-2-hydr­oxy-6,6-dimethyl­bicyclo­[3.1.1]heptane-2-carboxyl­ate penta­hydrate

In the title compound, Na+·C10H15O3               −·5H2O, the vertices of a distorted octa­hedron centred on the Na+ cation are defined by six O atoms of water mol­ecules. The edge-sharing Na(H2O)6 octa­hedra form a chain extended along the b-axis direction with adjacent Na+ cations related by a twofold screw symmetry operation. The organic anion, which is not in close contact with the Na+ cation, is hydrogen-bonded to an uncoordinated water mol­ecule and to water mol­ecules of the Na(H2O)6 octa­hedra.
