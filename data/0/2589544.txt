Pre-operative respiratory evaluation and management of patients for upper abdominal surgery.

Patients presenting for surgery, be it on an elective or emergency basis, do so in the hope that the anesthetic will be without risk. Yet complications which arise are not always due to anesthesia. More often, the surgical process and factors intrinsic to the patient are major determinants of outcome. Pre-operative assessment allows review of the patient and the proposed surgery, and formation of a plan of management for the pre-, intra-, and post-operative anesthetic care. This paper provides an overview of the pre-operative assessment and management of patients who are to undergo upper abdominal surgery, with the aim of minimizing their risk of post-operative pulmonary complications. In particular, factors which contribute to the development of post-operative respiratory problems are described.
