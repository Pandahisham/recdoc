GENITAL SELF AMPUTATION FOR URINARY SYMPTOM RELIEF OR SUICIDE?

Complete combined amputation of penis and scrotum has been rarely reported. A case of an elderly male with complete genital mutilation is presented with the complexities of the phenomena. He was suffering from severe depressive episode and had experienced multiple events related to urinary system. His vulnerability to self injurious behaviour had been established by past suicide attempt. Gross impairment of judgement and depressive cognitions were instrumental in precipitating such behaviour. Related literatures are discussed.
