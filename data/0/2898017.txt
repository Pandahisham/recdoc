Why men age faster but reproduce longer than women:  mTOR and                        evolutionary perspectives

                     Women                        live longer than men. Yet, it is believed that men do not age faster than                        women but simply are weaker at every age. In contrast, I discuss that men                        age faster. From evolutionary perspective, high accidental death rate in                        young males is compatible with fast aging. Mechanistically, hyper-activated                        mTOR (Target of Rapamycin) may render young males robust at the cost of                        accelerated aging. But if women age slower, why then is it women who have                        menopause? Some believe that menopause is programmed and purposeful                        (grandmother theory). In contrast, I discuss how menopause is not                        programmed but rather is an aimless continuation of the same program that                        initially starts reproduction at puberty. This quasi-program causes                        over-activation of female reproductive system, which is very vulnerable to                        over-activation. Mechanisms of aging and menopause are discussed.                

Women have lived longer than men in different                            countries and in every era [1]. In 1980 in the USA, the estimated life                            expectancy at birth was 70 years for men and 77.5 years for women [2]. In the                            world, 75% and 90% of people older than 100 years and 110 years (respectively)                            are women. And the longest living person (122 years old) was a woman. But do                            women age slower than men? The conventional opinion is that women and men age                            at the same rate but men are ‘less robust' than women [1]. Seemingly in                            agreement, the mortality rate is lower in young women compared with young men.                            In women, the mortality rate is lower at every age, even in childhood. In other                            words, "women do not live longer than men because they age slowly, but because                            they are more robust at every age" [1].                            This reasoning would be correct if causes of death were the same at every                            age. However, young and old men die from different causes. Young men die from                            accidents, while old men die from aging (technically speaking, from age-related                            diseases).                                        
There is                            a very noticeable jump of mortality in the late teens in men [1]. Young men are                            often engaged in competitive, reckless, and dangerous activities. Therefore,                            even in modern society, the accidental death rate is high in young men.                            Historically, the accidental death rate in men was much higher than it is now.                            (Due to a fierce competition for status and mates, due to fights and wars,                            young men were killed at a very high rate). So, historically, men had lower                            chances to survive into old age than women had. And, according to evolutionary                            theory, a high accidental death rate determines fast aging [3-5]. If most men                            died young from accidental death, then they could not live long enough to                            experience aging. Then there was no natural selection to postpone aging. So                            accelerated aging in men is predictable from evolutionary perspective. But                            accelerated aging is also predictable mechanistically.                                        
In males, muscle hypertrophy                            and heavy body helps to compete with other males. (In fact, men are larger than                            women.)  Cellular growth and hypertrophy are stimulated by the mTOR (mammalian                            Target of Rapamycin) intracellular signaling pathway. Insulin, growth factors,                            amino acids, glucose lipoproteins, and testosterone all activate the mTOR                            pathway [6-9].   In turn, the mTOR pathway stimulates protein synthesis and                            cell size growth [10]. For example, skeletal muscle hypertrophy depends on the                            mTOR pathway [11,12]. In addition, inhibition of the mTOR pathway decreases                            testosterone levels and spermatogenesis [13]. Thus, activation of mTOR may                            provide a selective advantage to young males.                                        
On the other hand, the mTOR                            pathway is required forcellular senescence of mammalian cells [14-18]. Cellular                            aging is driven by the remaining activation of mitogenic signaling pathways in                            post-mitotic cells [19,20]. In fact, mechanistically, aging is a continuation                            of growth, driven in part by mTOR [21].  In agreement, mTOR is involved in                            age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, cancer, which                            are deadly manifestations of aging (see for review [22-24]).                            And rapamycin prolongs                            lifespan in mammals [25].                                        
The TOR pathway                                            is activated by growth factors, hormones and nutrients. This activation is                                            beneficial early in life by stimulating growth and muscle hypertrophy.                                            Evolutionary perspective: This was especially important for prehistoric                                            men, living in dangerous environment that required physical strength.  mTOR                                            is involved in aging later in life, but most men died young from accidental                                            death. Thus, robustness early in life is associated with accelerated aging.                                                            
Thus, over-activation of                            mTOR may provide an advantage (muscle hypertrophy, high levels of testosterone                            and high spermatogenesis) in early life at the cost of accelerated aging later                            in life. As an illuminating example, mice over-expressing growth hormone                            exhibit increased levels of IGF-I and adult body size, reduced life span and                            reproductive life span [26]. (Note: IGF-I stimulates mTOR, Figure 1).                                        
Humans                            do not die from "healthy" aging. Humans die from age-related diseases. The mTOR                            pathway is involved in age-related diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis,                            hypertension, heart failure, osteoporosis, type II diabetes [22,24,27].                            These diseases are deadly manifestations of aging. When aging is accelerated,                            age-related diseases occur earlier in life too. Healthy aging (a late onset of                            diseases) is associated with longevity (see for discussion [28]). For example,                            centenarians (100 years old or older) show a delay in the onset of age-related                            diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and                            Alzheimer's disease. In other words, those who age slower are healthier [29,30].                                        
If women age slower than                            men, then age-related diseases must be delayed in women. In fact, most                            age-related diseases are delayed in women compared with men. For example,                            coronary atherosclerosis is postponed in women. Not only atherosclerosis, but                            also cancer and most other diseases of aging occur earlier in men than in women                            [31]. Women also live more years than men free of each of these diseases with                            the exception of arthritis [32]. Women rarely die from age-related diseases                            before menopause. The later onset of diseases in women compared with men                            suggests that women age slower than men.                                        
Intriguingly,                            slower erosion of human telomeres favor females [33] and, even further, the                            rate of leukocyte telomere shortening predicts mortality from cardiovascular                            disease in elderly men [34]. I speculate that high rate of telomere shortening                            reflects cellular hyper-activation and may be suppressed by rapamycin.                                        
Yet common wisdom holds that                            women age faster than men. One should not confuse aging and subjective                            perception of youthfulness and sexual attractiveness,                            which reflects fertility. Aging is an increase of the probability of death. And                            a 50-year-old man has higher chances to die than a 50- year-old woman.                            Furthermore, men acquire grey hair and wrinkles faster than women and thus men                            even ‘look' older [35]. Although men age faster, they can reproduce longer. And                            here is another puzzle: why women undergo menopause.                                        
Like aging itself, menopause                            is tolerated by natural selection, because women (until recently) did not live                            long enough to experience it. (In modern society, there must be a very strong                            natural selection for delayed menopause). So an evolutionary explanation is                            simple: ancestral women did not live long enough to have menopause. But male                            lifespan was even shorter: why then do men not have menopause? What is so                            special about female reproduction?                                        
There is common opinion among traditional                            gerontologists that menopause is beneficial for women, has an evolutionary                            advantage and is adaptive [36-38]. It was suggested, for instance, that                            menopause prevents death of women in labor. The most popular is a "grandmother                            hypothesis" that menopause frees older women to help their daughters to raise                            grandchildren. This is a sort of group-selection hypothesis. Why do not daughters                            delay reproduction just in order to help their mothers raise siblings?  Or what                            is the biological sense to stop reproduction, if a woman has no grandchildren                            living with her? The crucial assumption of ‘grandmother' hypothesis is that                            menopause occurs only in humans [37]. Yet, menopause was documented in                            non-human primates, rodents, whales, dogs, rabbits, elephants and domestic                            livestock [39]. It was shown, for instance, that mice eventually undergo                            ovarian changes analogous to menopause in humans [40,41].                                        
 It was shown that                            grandmothers may promote survival of their maternal grandchildren in Gambia                            [37]. Grandmothers are useful but menopause is not. There is no experimental                            evidence that menopause is beneficial even when women live with grandchildren                            in Gambia. Menopause accelerates age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis,                            osteoporosis and cancer [42,43]. Reproductive death provides no selective                            benefit (unless group-selection theories of aging are correct) and ‘grandmother                            hypothesis' contradicts the evolutionary theory. If aging is not programmed,                            then reproductive aging is not programmed too.                                        
TOR is activated                                                by nutrients and insulin and in turn causes depletion of IRS1/2 and insulin                                                resistance. Whereas nutrients activate TOR, low nutrients and metformin                                                deactivate TOR.                                                                
Aging                            is not programmed but quasi-programmed [22,44-46]. ("Quasi-" means  "as if,                            resembling"). Quasi-program is an aimless continuation of a useful program that                            was not switched off                     upon its completion. Unlike a program, a                            quasi-program has no purpose. Developmental programs become aimless                            quasi-programs later in life. Quasi-programs are driven by antagonistic                            pleiotropic genes, which are beneficial early in life on the cost of aging                            later in life. Most genes that control aging and longevity constitute the mTOR                            pathway [22,23]. mTOR is absolutely essential during embryonic development                            [47,48]. In post-development, mTOR is involved in aging and age-related                            diseases [22].                                        
Nutrients activate mTOR and                            cause insulin-resistance in cell culture [49,50] as well as systemically in rodents                            and humans [51-54]. There is a negative feedback loop between insulin signaling                            and TOR (Figure 2). When mTOR is activated, it blocks insulin signaling                            (insulin resistance) [49,55]. Noteworthy, insulin resistance is associated                            with premature menopause in some patients [56].                                        
Since                            aging is not programmed, it does not hurt on purpose. It does not cause ovarian                            failure (menopause) on purpose. The logic of aging is simple: the most fragile systems fail first. A female reproductive system is                            fragile because it depends on exact interactions between The hypothalamus and                            ovaries, communicating via dozens of hormones. The menstrual cycle is regulated                            by interplay of negative and positive feedback loops. The hypothalamus                            stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH),                            which in turn stimulates follicles in the ovaries (Figure 3). Follicles                            maturate and secrete estrogens. Estrogens inhibit the hypothalamus, decreasing                            secretion of FSH (a negative feedback loop).  In turn, FSH stimulates ovarian                            follicles, which produce estrogens, which in turn inhibit FSH production. Also,                            estrogens stimulate secretion of Lutenizing Hormone (LH). LH in turn causes                            ovulation. So for the normal menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus should have a                            narrow range of sensitivity to estrogens. Both too high and too low                            sensitivities are not compatible with menstrual cycles. In comparison, regulation                            of reproduction in men is simpler. There is a gradual decrease in fertility in                            men too (analogous to pre-menopause), although this usually does not result in                            testicular failure during a man's lifetime [57,58].                                        
 For                                            simplicity, only the FSH-estrogen feedback loop is shown. FSH stimulates follicles                                            and production of estrogens (Est). Estrogens inhibit FSH production (negative                                            feedback). (A) In girls, the hypothalamus is extremely sensitive to                                            estrogens and even low levels of estrogens inhibit FSH. (B) The onset of                                            menstrual cycle. While the hypothalamus is becoming resistant to estrogens, FSH                                            stimulates the ovaries and estrogen production. Progressive activation of follicles                                            from the dormant pool serves as the source of fertilizable ova. (C) Pre-menopause.                                            While the hypothalamus is becoming progressively resistant to estrogens, FSH                                            progressively over-stimulates the ovaries. (D) The ovaries fail. Menopause                                            occurs when the primordial follicle pool is exhausted. Estrogen levels drop. The                                            feedback between hypothalamus and the ovaries is disrupted.                                                                
A half century ago, Vladimir                            Dilman proposed a "biological clock" that initially launches reproduction in                            puberty and then causes menopause [59,60]. This idea is absolutely compatible                            with quasi-programmed nature of menopause, as discussed herein.                                        
Before puberty, the                            hypothalamus is extremely sensitive to estrogens (Figure 3 A). Even low levels                            of estrogens suppress FSH production and, therefore, levels of FSH are low. At                            puberty, the hypothalamus becomes more resistant to estrogens. Then low levels                            of estrogens cannot suppress FSH. FSH in turn stimulates the ovarian follicles.                            Follicles produce estrogens, which in turn inhibit FSH production (Figure 3 B).                            During lifetime, resistance to estrogens continues to increase (Figure 3C).                            This ever-increasing resistance is an aim-less continuation of the same program                            that initiated menstrual cycle at puberty.  FSH is elevated in pre-menopause                            and rising serum FSH levels is one of the earliest signs of human female                            reproductive aging [61], [62]. Rising FSH levels over-stimulate the ovaries (Figure 3C), thus depleting follicles (Figure 3D).                                        
FSH hyper-stimulates the                            ovaries, causing more follicles to be recruited simultaneously (Figure 3 C).                            This may explain the increased tendency of older mothers to have dizygotic                            twins [63]. Due to hypothalamic resistance to estrogens, estrogens cannot                            induce LH surges, which are necessary for ovulation. Therefore, follicles are                            recruited without progression to ovulation. Therefore, fertility gradually decreases                            long before menopause.                                        
Hypothalamic                            resistance to estrogens causes higher FSH levels and lower LH pulses, disturbed                            feedback relationships and decrease in fertility [64]. Levels of estrogens tend                            to be increased in pre-menopause [64], but even increased estrogens cannot                            suppress FSH [61]. FSH over-stimulates follicle recruitment, leading eventually                            to follicular depletion (Figure 3D). This process eventually results in ovarian                            failure (Figure 3 D). Post-menopause is characterized by a drop in estrogen                            levels because of the depletion of follicular oocytes that normally produce                            estrogen (Figure 3 D).                                        
Noteworthy, aged mouse ovaries possess                            rare premeiotic germ cells that can generate oocytes following transplantation                            into a young host environment [65], and even further young adult donor bone                            marrow infusions into female mice postpone age-related reproductive failure                            [66]. In other words, some follicles may become unresponsive due to                            age-associated over-stimulation but can be rejuvenated.                                        
Thus,                            reproductive aging is set in motion at puberty by an ever-increasing                            hypothalamic resistance to estrogens.  By increasing resistance of the hypothalamus                            to estrogens, the developmental program establishes the menstrual cycle at                            puberty. There is no program to cause menopause. It simply happens because                            resistance to estrogens (and some other hormones) is ever-increasing. This is                            an example of a quasi-program, a continuation of a program that was not                            switched off upon its completion (at puberty). The quasi-program interrupts the                            same reproductive function that the program establishes. The same mechanism                            (resistance of the hypothalamus to estrogen) first starts and then ends                            reproduction in women. An increased resistance to estrogens can explain both                            initiation and termination of the menstrual cycle.                                        
How may we explain an increased resistance to estrogens?                            Resistance may be secondary to hyper-stimulation by estrogens themselves. In                            fact, in old acyclic mice, ovariectomy for 2 months partially reversed the                            hypothalamic resistance [41]. Hyper-stimulation of the hypothalamus by                            estrogens may cause resistance, in turn increasing stimulation of the ovary,                            until failure occurs. Alternatively, overstimulation of the hypothalamus with                            hormones and nutrients can cause estrogen-resistance. Is there a feedback                            resistance to overstimulation as shown in Figure 2? Then over-stimulation, with                            secondary resistance, is the driving cause of reproductive program and                            quasi-program. And most importantly over-stimulation occurs simultaneously both                            in the ovary and the brain.                                        
I propose that the                            increasing activation of mTOR (both in the hypothalamus and the ovary) drives                            hormone resistance, causing the onset of reproduction and then                            hyper-stimulation of the ovary and the hypothalamus and finally menopause (Figure 4).  Let us bring together several pieces of data.                                        
First, mTOR is a regulator                            of puberty onset via modulation of the hypothalamus [67]. Also, both FSH and                            estrogens activate the mTOR pathway [68], [69]. So if TOR is activated                            constantly, it may not respond further to stimulation (hormone resistance).                                        
Second, in mice lacking                            PTEN  in oocytes, the entire primordial follicle pool is activated.                            Subsequently, all primordial follicles become depleted in early adulthood,                            causing premature ovarian failure [70]. PTEN loss                            results in suppression of Foxo, so the Foxo was a primer suspect [70]. Yet, in                            theory loss of PTEN must also result in mTOR overactivation (Figure 1). I                            suggest that premature ovarian failure is                            caused by over-activation of TOR. (Note: this paper was initially written in 2008                            and was ahead of its time and was not well received by conventional journals.                            Now it can be updated). It was shown tuberous sclerosis complex (Tsc), which                            negatively regulates mTOR, functions in oocytes to maintain the quiescence of                            primordial follicles. In mutant mice lacking the Tsc1 gene in oocytes, the                            entire pool of primordial follicles is activated prematurely due to elevated                            mTORC1 activity in the oocyte, ending up with follicular depletion in early                            adulthood and causing premature ovarian failure [71,72].                                        
                                            The TOR pathway in the hypothalamus and the ovary is activated by growth                                            factors, hormones (leptin, estrogens and FSH, LH, respectively) and nutrients.                                            This activation starts menarche and then leads to menopause.                                                                 
Third, calorie restriction                            (CR) prevents age-related increase in estrogen resistance in the hypothalamus                            of old female mice [73]. As already discussed, CR de-activates TOR [74]. I                            speculate that CR de-activates mTOR and delays estrogen resistance in the                            hypothalamus. Simultaneously, by deactivating mTOR in the oocytes, it may delay                            their depletion.                                        
It was shown almost a century ago [75]                            and then reproduced numerous times that CR extends lifespan and prevents                            age-related infertility in rodents. In most of these studies, CR was initiated                            at weaning, causing a delayed onset of sexual maturation. So, the same                            condition (CR) delays both puberty and menopause. This is consistent with the                            notion that a quasi-program (menopause) is a mere continuation of the program                            (puberty).  But quasi-programs can be manipulated, exactly like programs.                             Recently it has been shown that a moderate caloric restriction initiated in                            rodents during adulthood sustains reproductive function of the female                            reproductive axis into advanced chronological age [76].                                        
Fifth, metformin, an                            antidiabetic drug, activates AMPK and thus inhibits mTOR [77]. Furthermore,                            metformin inhibits mTOR in AMPK-independent manner too. Metformin restores                            ovulations in patients with premature menopause associated with polycystic                            ovary syndrome [56]. On the other hand, metformin delays a premature onset of                            the menstrual cycle [78]. So the same agent that inhibits the onset of                            reproductive function also inhibits its termination. This antagonistic                            pleiotropic effect is consistent with the notion of the same mechanism                            switching reproduction on and off. Metformin slowed down aging and the                            age-related switch-off of estrous function in mice [79]. Thus menopause can be                            delayed pharmacologically.                                        
This article presents two                        hypotheses. The first hypothesis explains (from both an evolutionary and                        mechanistic perspective) why aging is accelerated in men.  From the                        evolutionary perspective, the high accidental death rate in young men                        determines an accelerated aging. A model of TOR-driven aging provides a                        mechanistic explanation. When the accidental death rate is high, it is                        important to be bigger and stronger.  And the mTOR pathway is involved in                        growth and cellular hypertrophy. So, overactivated mTOR may be adaptive for                        young men.                                
But this can accelerate                        aging. At the cost of accelerated aging, over-stimulated mTOR pathway may                        provide an advantage earlier in life. And vice versa as discussed, "weak mTOR"                         provides disadvantage earlier in life and, vice versa, robustness and fast                        aging are associated [28]. Noteworthy, "competitive, aggressive personality"                        among men is associated with atherosclerosis and earlier death from age-related                        coronary disease [80].                                
The second hypothesis                        explains why menopause in women occurs despite                 slow-aging. Simply, the                        regulation of the menstrual cycle is fragile. There is a fine balance between                        ovarian stimulation by FSH and feedback hypothalamic responsiveness to                        estrogens. The menstrual cycle is vulnerable. Menopause is an example of a                        quasi-program (a program that was not switched off after its completion). In                        puberty, an increasing resistance to estrogen starts reproduction (a program).                        A further increase in the resistance (a quasi-program) causes overactivation of                        the ovary, decreasing fertility. This process can be treated pharmacologically (as any other age-related disease) to postpone menopause Potential therapeutic                        interventions to postpone menopause (as well as abolishment of the harmful                        consequences of menopause) will be discussed in forthcoming book The Origin                                of Aging.
