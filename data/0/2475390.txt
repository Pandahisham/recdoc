Efficacy of cervical intrarepithelial neoplasia (CIN) treatment by cold coagulation.

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of cold coagulation in the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The study design consisted of a retrospective review of case records of all women treated with cold coagulation from the colposcopy clinics inception in 1980 to 1994. A total of 725 women received treatment with cold coagulation. All grades of CIN were treated. 632 (87.1%) had long term negative follow up. 93 (12.6%) of patients had abnormal cytological follow up, but only 45 (6.2%) required re-treatment. Within the first year after treatment 52 (7.1%) patients presented with persistent cytological abnormalities, 32 (4.4%) required repeated treatment for persistent dyskaryosis. 41 (5.6%) of patients had recurrent cytological abnormalities, 13 (1.8%) required repeated treatment. Recurrence developed between two and 12 years from initial treatment. One case of cervical carcinoma following treatment with cold coagulation was recorded. Our data suggest that cold coagulation appears to be safe, efficient treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
