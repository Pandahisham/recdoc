THE BEHAVIOR OF POX VIRUSES IN THE RESPIRATORY TRACT 

 Variola virus was cultivated in embryonated eggs from smallpox crusts and maintained through 85 passages. Therein it produced foci of cellular proliferation and necrosis on the chorioallantoic membrane but did not affect the embryo. The virus from egg cultures was inactive in the skin of the rabbit on primary injection and in the testis both initially and on passage. In the monkey it provoked a cutaneous eruption of short duration after an incubation period of 5 days. On nasal instillation in the mouse the virus caused no symptoms and failed to survive on the mucous membrane of the upper air passages. Beginning with the 64th egg passage it was regularly recoverable from the lung, on subinoculation in eggs, through the 5th day and occasionally through the 7th day. Its presence in the lung was attended by progressive pathological changes.
