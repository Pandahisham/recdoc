Pyridinium trans-di­aqua­bis­[oxalato(2−)-κ2O1,O2]chromate(III) urea monosolvate

The asymmetric unit of the title solvated mol­ecular salt, (C5H6N)[Cr(C2O4)2(H2O)2]·CO(NH2)2, contains half a formula unit. Each component is completed by crystallographic twofold symmetry: in the cation, one C and the N atom lie on the rotation axis; in the anion, the CrIII ion lies on the axis; in the solvent mol­ecule, the C and the O atom lie on the axis. The aqua ligands are in a trans disposition in the resulting CrO6 octa­hedron. In the crystal, the components are linked by O—H⋯O, N—H⋯O and N—H⋯(O,O) hydrogen bonds, generating a three-dimensional network.
