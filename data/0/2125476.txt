THE INFLUENCE OF THE VAGUS NERVES UPON CONDUCTION BETWEEN AURICLES AND VENTRICLES IN THE DOG DURING AURICULAR FIBRILLATION

 The experiments that have been reported indicate that stimulation of either the right vagus or the left vagus nerve is equally effectual in blocking impulses from the auricles to the ventricles when auricular fibrillation is present. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve is as effectual in blocking impulses from the normally beating auricles as from the auricles when in a state of fibrillation, and the type of auricular activity has apparently no influence on the effect which stimulation of the left vagus has on auriculoventricular conduction.
