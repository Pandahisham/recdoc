Objective. Limited information exists on features of pediatric Selective IgM immunodeficiency (SIgMID). Previously published pediatric cases and 2 new cases are reviewed. Methods. English literature from PubMed and references from relevant articles were reviewed. Previously reported cases and 2 new cases from an allergy/immunology practice were analyzed. Results. Forty-nine reported cases of SIgMID presented with respiratory infections (77.6%), gastrointestinal disease (16.3%), skin disease (12.2%), and meningitis (8.2%). Mean serum IgM level was 16.5 ± 13.8 mg/dL. Two patients were identified with SIgMID among 6300 active pediatric patients (0.03%) presenting with asthma, vasomotor rhinitis, and recurrent respiratory infections. In the 51 cases reported, none developed lymphoproliferative disease nor evolved into panhypogammaglobulinemia; four fatalities were reported. Conclusions. The prevalence of SIgMID in our pediatric population was 0.03%. In general, respiratory infections are the common comorbid conditions. Death and autoimmune disease are uncommon complications of pediatric  SIgMID.

Selective IgM immunodeficiency (SIgMID) is a dysgammaglobulinemia characterized by an isolated low level of serum IgM, usually <20 mg/dL in infants and children or <2 standarddeviations or 10% below age adjusted means [1–3].  Usually, serum IgM levels are <10–20 mg/dL [3]. The level of other immunoglobulin isotypes is typically normal, althoughIgE may be increased.  It is said to be a rare primary immunodeficiency, with the prevalence of completely deficient IgM patients reported as approximately 0.03% in a community-based study. [1]  However, the prevalence of those withdeficient but detectable levels of IgM is closer to 0.1–3.0% in hospitalized patients [1, 4, 5], 1.6%in an unselected community health screening [1, 6], 0.07% in an allergy andimmunology clinic [7], and 0.26% in an adult allergy and immunology clinic [8].There is a slightly higher penetration of SIgMID in males (1.97%) versusfemales (1.42%) [1]. The prevalence in the pediatric population (<18 yearsof age) has not been reported.
				 A variety of bacterial and viralinfections have been linked with SIgMID in the pediatric and adult populations(Table 1) [8].  In children, infectiousagents have included Pneumocystis carinii [9], Giardia [10], Staphylococcus [10, 11], Salmonella [12], Listeria monocytogenes [13], meningococcus [6, 14, 15], Pseudomonas [10, 16], molluscumcontagiosum [17], cytomegalovirus [18], and varicella [17].  These organisms account for recurrentinfectious dermatitis, diarrhea, meningitis, upper and lower respiratoryinfections, sepsis, and in some cases, death. Secondary IgMID presumptively from another cause has been associatedwith an array of noninfectious diseases in children and adults, in particular,autoimmune diseases and malignancies [8]. In children, celiac disease and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Table 1) have been reported but other autoimmune diseasesand malignancies have not.  We present areview of 49 previously reported pediatric patients with SIgMID and 2 new casesfrom our practice.  The relativefrequencies of various clinical, immunological and demographic features,associations, and complications are established in this series.  These findings are also compared andcontrasted to adult cases previously reported [8].
We undertook a retrospective (2002–2005) medical record review of 20000 chartedpatients seen in our practice over a 3-year period.  Of these, 6300 patients were children (<18 years of age).  Charts were selectedwith a diagnosis of SIgMID, selective IgA immunodeficiency (SIgAID), commonvariable immunodeficiency (CVID), Bruton agammaglobulinemia, and transienthypogammaglobulinemia of infancy and reviewed for immunoglobulin levels (IgG,IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgG subclasses), isohemagglutinin levels, autoantibodyserologies, presenting clinical symptoms, concurrent conditions, and clinicalcourse.  Patients diagnosed with SIgMIDwere screened serologically for celiac disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, andautoimmune collagen vascular disease.  Aliterature search was conducted of reported cases of SIgMID in the Englishliterature through PubMed from 1966, and from the bibliographies of relatedarticles.  Identified in the literaturewere 361 previously reported SIgMID patients, comprised of 155 adult, 49pediatric, and 157 age unspecified patients. The analysesof the 155 adult, 157 age-unspecified cases, and 36 new adult cases of SIgMIDhave been previously reported [8]. Comparative analysis was made of clinical, laboratory, and demographicdata of pediatric cases to reported adult cases of SIgMID.
The group mean and 1 SD werecalculated for group serum IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE levels and age ofpresentation.  Descriptive statistics wereused to denote frequencies of occurrence of comorbid conditions.  Statistical analyses were done with MicrosoftExcel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).
Forty-nine previously describedpediatric cases of SIgMID were identified ranging in age from 1 month to 17years (Table 1).  The mean age at thetime of diagnosis was 6.0 ± 4.7 years. Of these cases, where reported, presenting respiratory infectionsoccurred in 78.4% of cases (Table 2). Frequencies of specific presenting respiratory infections were  otitis media (39.2%), pneumonia/lowerrespiratory infections (19.6%), bronchitis (9.8%), and upper respiratoryinfections (9.8%).  Frequency of nonrespiratorypresenting illnesses included  gastrointestinalillness (13.7%), skin disorders (9.8%) with atopic dermatitis the most common(6.1%), failure to thrive (7.8%), asthma (7.8%), meningitis (7.8%), andvasomotor rhinitis (3.9%).  Five patientshad celiac disease and serum IgM levels normalized in all cases on gluten freediets.  There were no patients withmalignancies reported.  There were 2asymptomatic cases reported.  The meanserum IgM level was 16.5 ± 13.8 mg/dL. Serum IgA and IgG levels were normal in all cases.  Mean serum IgE level was elevated at 1814 ±3509 IU/mL.  Four patients developedrespiratory allergy while 3 patients developed asthma. Two patients lackedprotective IgG responses to polysaccharide and protein antigen/vaccinechallenge and clinically responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)treatment.  Where tested, most patientshad low-to-normal titersof IgM isohemagglutinins.  Infectionsfrom pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Pneumocystiscarinii, Giardia,cytomegalovirus, Listeria monocytogenes, meningococcus, molluscumcontagiosum, and varicella were reported.
Sex and Race: therewere 2 Caucasian males and 0 females identified in our pediatric population of6300 patients.
					Age at time ofdiagnosis:age of diagnosis of SIgMID was 10(patient 1) and 12 years of age (patient 2). Onset of SIgMID could not be determined or estimated accurately,although patient 1 had normal IgM, IgG, IgA levels 6 years prior to diagnosis.  Observation Period: patient1 had been followed for 8 years and patient 2 for 5 years post diagnosis. Immunoglobulin Levels: two patients inour pediatric patient population of 6300 (incidence 0.03%) were identifiedwith reduced serum IgM levels less than 2 SD of age-adjusted means.  Asymptomatic patients may have been missedsince only symptomatic patients with recurrent infections or unusual infectionwere screened for immunodeficiency. Neither patient had undetectable IgM levels.  The serum IgM levels were 21 mg/dL (patient1) and 30 mg/dL (patient 2) with normal serum IgA, serum IgG levels, and IgGsubclasses.  The serum IgE level was 15 IU/ml in patient 1 [normal levels (<200 IU/ml)]. Immunoglobulin levels were repeated 6 monthsand 2, 4, and 7 (patient 1) years after diagnosis and remained essentially thesame with persistence of serum IgM <30 mg/dL in both patients through time. Within the same database ofpatients there were no pediatric patients with CVID, Bruton agammaglobulinemia,transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, or SIgAID. Serologic Evaluation: because of previous reports of autoimmune disease,thyroiditis, and celiac disease in patients with SIgMID, the 2 patients werescreened for anemia, ANA, anti-endomysial antibody, anti-gliadin antibody, anti-transglutaminaseantibody, and thyroid autoantibodies.  Noautoantibodies were identified in either patient.  Neither patient was anemic. FunctionalAntibodies: both patients were tested for ABO blood group andisohemagglutinin level.  Detectable lowtiter isohemagglutinins were noted (patient 1 anti-A 1:4; patient 2 anti-B1:8). IgG antibody responses to tetanus, H.influenzae, and pneumococcus vaccination were normal.
Infections: our 2patients  presented with a history of respiratory infections: patient 1 withrecurrent otitis media and patient 2 with pneumonia.  Neither patient had a severe life-threateninginfection.  Neither patient had anunusual bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infection, meningitis,bacteremia, or abscess prior to or during the followup period. GastrointestinalAbnormalities:  chronic gastrointestinal illnesseswere not noted. Autoimmune Disease:  no autoimmune disorders were notedat time of presentation or during the followup period. Other RespiratoryConditions including Allergy:  upper respiratory allergies wereruled out by skin testing.  Other noninfectiousrespiratory conditions seen included asthma and vasomotor rhinitis in bothpatients.  Neither patient had nasalpolyps. Miscellaneous Abnormalities: neither idiopathic angioedema noridiopathic anaphylaxis was seen.  Duringthe followup period of observation, neither patients transformed into CVID. Mortality:neither patient died of serious infections, malignancies or complications ofautoimmune disease. Family History of Patients:  there were no family histories ofinfantile deaths, increased susceptibility to infections, or primaryimmunodeficiencies among immediate relatives. Screeningsfor immunodeficiencies in parents and siblings were recommended but compliancewas inconsistent.  Where tested, noparent or sibling was identified with an immunoglobulin deficiency. Therapy:  neither patient was put on IVIgtherapy.  In general, infections weresuccessfully treated with conventional courses of antibiotics.
Immunoglobulin M is a pentamerfound in the intravascular compartment and on the surface of Blymphocytes.  It is the antibody isotypeproduced initially in the immune response, and the first immunoglobulin classto be synthesized by a fetus or newborn. IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta, and for these reasons thedemonstration of IgM specific antibody is useful in the assessment of neonatalinfection.  Dysregulation of IgM leadingto elevated or reduced serum levels has been reported in a number of conditions [8].  In children, isolated elevated levels of IgMhave been associated with acute or recurrent infections (Hyper-IgMimmunodeficiency, Epstein Barr virus infection) [32, 33].  Fluctuating levels of serum IgM associatedwith secondary conditions in some adult cases may have prognostic significance,as in adult systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [34].  Decreased levels of IgM have been associatedwith episodes of recurrent infection, thymic hypoplasia, celiac disease,autoimmune disease, and certain adult malignancies and several primaryimmunodeficiencies (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, CVID,Bruton agammaglobulinemia, SIgMID, combined IgG and IgM immunodeficiency, andtransient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy) and congenital disorders (Bloomsyndrome and Russell-Silver syndrome). Isolated reduced serum IgM levels secondary to these other illnessesshould be excluded before making a diagnosis of primary SIgMID.  Primary selective IgM immunodeficiency isless common than secondary IgM immunodeficiency.
SIgMID has been characterized as arare primary immunodeficiency differentiated by a low serum IgM level, lessthan 2 SD or <10% of age adjusted normal controls or absolute levels of 10–20 mg/dL in infants and children [3]. The earliest recognized cases were described in children in 1966 [9, 19]. More pediatric casesand the first adult cases were described in the late 1960s and were classifiedas dysgammaglobulinemia V [2, 6, 12, 21]. Over the subsequent 40 years, small series and isolated case reportshave appeared.  Recently, a retrospectivereview with a large cohort of adult SIgMID was reported further characterizingthis illness in patients ≥18 years of age [8].
Heterogeneous lymphocyte abnormalities have been reported in patients(mainly adults) with SIgMID.  Several invitro and in vivo immunologic, phenotypic and functional profiles have beendescribed, some conflicting, and are summarized in Table 3.
Heterogeneous gene impairments regulating terminal B celldifferentiation have been reported in SIgAID [35] and CVID.  Recently, mutations in the inducible T cellcostimulator gene, the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator, andcyclophilin ligand interactor have been described in CVID and SIgAID [36].  Similar in depth in vitro studies oflymphocyte function and molecular genetic studies have not been applied topediatric and adult patients with SIgMID [8]. Functional (except isohemagglutinin titers), phenotypic or moleculargenetic studies were not performed in our cohort.  The latter was not the subject of thisanalysis.
SIgMID is regarded as an uncommon disorder and oftenneglected in the discussion of primary immunodeficiencies [36, 37].  A discussion of SIgMID is notably absent inrecently published practice parameters on primary immunodeficiencies fromexpert panels [37].  The prevalence ofSIgMID has been reported to be less than SIgAID in an unselected group of 3,213individuals ages 4–87 [1]. In the atopic population, the prevalence of both SIgAID (4.5%) andSIgMID (ranging from 1.56–22%) may be higher than in the generalpopulation [38].  The prevalence ofSIgMID in an adult symptomatic population of patients going to an allergy andimmunology practice (1:385) [8] may be much higher than previously thought(1:15,000) [7].  By comparison, theprevalence in our pediatric symptomatic patients going to an allergy andimmunology practice was 0.03%—one-tenth of the adult prevalence.  Asymptomatic patients with SIgMID have beenreported (up to 19% in some series) [14, 21, 39], but only 2 cases wereobserved in children [14, 21]. Asymptomatic pediatric patients with SIgMID were not screened for oridentified in our retrospective practice database analysis.  These cases are typically found during theinvestigation of other diseases (autoimmune disease or cancer) or in familymembers of patients with immunodeficiency or by chance.  Screening for asymptomatic cases would becost prohibitive.  In our review, 1pediatric patient with a complete deficiency of  IgM was identified, reflecting the rarity ofsuch an occurrence [16].  In Cassidy’spopulation of 3213 unselected Caucasian individuals, only 1 patient hadundetectable serum IgM levels (0.03% incidence) [1].
Common with other primary immunodeficiencies, recurrentsinopulmonary infections were present in 74.5% of pediatric SIgMID cases (Table 4).  Although meningitis, sepsis,atypical infections and fatalities secondary to infections have previously beenreported in pediatric SIgMID, these complications were not seen in our 2cases.  In contrast to CVID and SIgAIDwhere antibiotics may be used for extended periods along with prophylacticantibiotics, our 2 pediatric patients with recurrent respiratory infectionsresponded to conventional courses of antibiotics and were not treated withprophylactic antibiotics.  Also differentfrom CVID and  SIgAID, our patients, and the majority of previously reported pediatriccases, did not receive IVIg.  Twopediatric SIgMID cases with functional IgG antibody deficiency received IVIg[31].  Given these observations, adultpatients with SIgMID and most pediatric cases of SIgMID experience infectionswith conventional organisms.  The absenceof virulent infections in most cases may be due to effective antibiotic therapyand/or the response of other immune systems to microorganisms that maycompensate for the low level of IgM.  Inaddition, earlier reported fatalities from infections (all prior to 1972) mayreflect less effective antibiotic coverage and/or hospital care than thatcurrently available.  Nevertheless, likeother primary immunodeficiencies. the morbidity of frequent infection in SIgMIDis high.  Appropriate immunization(influenza, H. influenzae,pneumococcus, pertussis), attention to concomitant treatment directed atallergic inflammation, and good hygiene are important preventativemeasures.  Aggressive antimicrobialtherapy is recommended to prevent and manage infectious complications.  IVIg may be instituted in cases of recurrent,debilitating or life threatening infection, and/or in patients with concomitantfunctional IgG deficiencies.
Autoimmune phenomena are seen in association with severalimmunoglobulin deficiency syndromes.  Inparticular, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, and autoimmune hemolyticanemia have been reported in CVID as well as SIgAID [5, 12].  From our review, in pediatric SIgMID cases,autoimmune disease is distinctly uncommon (3.9%), compared to 12% in previouslyreported adult SIgMID cases (Table 4) [8].
Dysgammaglobulinemia has been reported with several GIconditions including steatorrhea, nodular lymphoid hypoplasia, Crohn’s disease,ulcerative colitis, amyloidosis, disaccharidase deficiencies, perniciousanemia, schlerosing cholangitis, celiac disease and protein losingenteropathies [4, 20, 50].  Inparticular, celiac disease has been reported in association with severalprimary immunodeficiencies including isolated severe SIgAID [52, 53] or reducedIgA levels (20—<60 mg/100 mL) [20, 54, 55], panhypogammaglobulinemia [53] andisolated combined IgA and IgM deficiency [53]. IgM deficiency has been more frequently reported—including 30 of 75 (37%) of adult cases, 5 of5 childhood cases [20], 11 of 30 (37%) untreated adult patients [54], 8 of 11untreated adult patients [55], 6 of 11 untreated, and 2 of 7 treated adultpatients [55].  Studies based oncatabolism and distribution of labeled IgM have not shown any difference indiet controlled untreated celiac disease [55]. Where reported, SIgMID did not correlate with any specific biochemical,hematologic or histologic abnormalities. Jejunal biopsies of affected patients were no different than those ofceliac patients with normal immunoglobulin levels.  There was no unusual risk of infection inthese reported patients [55]. Of note, IgM levels returned to normal levels inmost pediatric and adult patients following a gluten-restricted diet [20, 55].  In one study, mean pretreatment IgMlevel was 31.4 and the mean post treatment level 73.6, the difference beingstatistically significant (P  = .0001) [20].  In those where the diet restriction wasremoved, IgM levels fell back to subnormal levels.  It has been suggested that this secondaryform of IgM deficiency is related to reduced synthesis from lymphoreticulardysfunction stimulated by gluten antigen exposure [54, 55].
The development of lymphoproliferative disorders and/or othermalignancies is a concern with several primary immunodeficiencies, especiallyCVID [37].  In SIgMID the risk isrelatively low in adults (2.6%) and negligible in children (0%).  Pediatric cases of SIgMID also differ fromadult cases in the absence of reported cases of angioedema, anaphylaxis, nasalpolyps, bronchiectasis, and thyroid disease (Table 4).  However, these conditions may become relevantconcerns as children with SIgMID mature into adults.  Vigilant followup and surveillance for thesecomplications may therefore be warranted.
Pediatric SIgMID is a rare immunodeficiency with a prevalenceof 0.03% in our symptomatic population. In our review of 51 pediatric patients with SIgMID, most patientspresented with respiratory infections which, in general, were not severe orlife threatening.  The coexistence ofautoimmune disease was rare, malignancies were not reported, and 4 fatalitieswere observed, 3 from fulminant infection, either meningitis or pneumonia.  This report should alert clinicians to thepossibility that SIgMID, although rare, may be the cause of recurrentrespiratory infections in children.  Inaddition, identification of patients with SIgMID may prevent some of thecomplications seen later in life with adult patients.  Larger collaborative studies will betterdefine the molecular genetics, pathogenesis, and clinical and immunologicphenotypes of this disorder in children.
