HIV-particles in spermatozoa of patients with AIDS and their transfer into the oocyte

By immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization at the electron microscopy level, and by the PCR technique, we have shown that HIV-1 binds and enters normal sperm; that viral particles, their antigens, and nucleic acid are present in sperm from HIV-1 infected men; and that such sperm can transfer HIV-1 like particles to normal human oocytes. We also present evidence that a galactosylceramide-like compound is present on the sperm membrane and could function as an alternative receptor for HIV.
