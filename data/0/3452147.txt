Frequent analgesics consumption inmigraineurs: comparison between chronic and episodicmigraineurs

To assess the frequent consumption of symptomaticmedications in migraineurs, we consecutively recruited 536migraineurs from a headache clinic. Among them, 194 (36.2%) hadchronic migraine and 342 had episodic migraine. When groupedaccording to duration of headache, the proportion of patientswith chronic migraine increased from 25.5% to 50.9% as headachehistory increased from <1 to >20 years. The percentage ofpatients with frequent analgesics consumption also increasedwith the duration of headache, in patients with both chronicmigraine (from 25.0% to 85.7%) and episodic migraine (from 20.0%to 59.3%). Nonetheless, patients with chronic migraine had ahigher prevalence of frequent consumption of abortivemedications than patients with episodic migraine regardless ofduration of headache history, and the common odds ratio acrossstrata of headache duration was 2.8 (95% confidence interval,1.9â€“4.1). However, we found that a long headache history is animportant risk factor for frequent consumption of symptomaticmedications in migraineurs in patients with both episodicmigraine and chronic migraine.
