THE SWINE LUNGWORM AS A RESERVOIR AND INTERMEDIATE HOST FOR SWINE INFLUENZA VIRUS 

 Multiple intramuscular injections of H. influenzae suis were found to precipitate swine influenza virus infections in a group of apparently normal swine. The most likely explanation of the phenomenon seemed to be that the animals, though healthy and susceptible, harbored the virus in some unknown manner. The factors possibly determining the phenomenon were explored experimentally but without success.
