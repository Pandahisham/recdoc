High incidence of classical Kaposi's sarcoma in Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

We have examined the incidence of non-AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in Iceland (1955-79) and the Faroe Islands (1974-95). In Iceland, 19 cases, nine in men and ten in women, were identified, and in the Faroe Islands four cases in men and three cases in women were found. This corresponded to surprisingly high incidence rates. In men, world standardized rates (per 100000 person-years) were 0.4 and 0.6 in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, respectively, and for women, the figures were 0.3 (Iceland) and 0.5 (the Faroe Islands). These are among the highest rates ever reported. No explanation for the high rates of Kaposi's sarcoma in these two North Atlantic communities could be identified.
