The incidence of cardiac lesions in infants born with major gastrointestinal malformations in Northern Ireland.

There is a recognised association between major gastrointestinal (GI) malformations and congenital heart disease (CHD). A retrospective study over 10 years involving 240 infants born with gastrointestinal malformations was conducted in the Royal Belfast Hospital For Sick Children (RBHSC). We felt it was important to look at the incidence of CHD diagnosed in the infants presenting to the tertiary referral centre in Belfast. Comparable figures for the incidence of CHD associated with major GI malformations was found in the literature.
