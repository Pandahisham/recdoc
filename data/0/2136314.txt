CONTROL BY FACTORS DISTINCT FROM THE S TRANSFORMING PRINCIPLE OF THE AMOUNT OF CAPSULAR POLYSACCHARIDE PRODUCED BY TYPE III PNEUMOCOCCI

 Pneumococci can possess the normal S transforming principle and yet produce amounts of capsular polysaccharide much less than would be expected if the quantity formed depended only on the nature of the S transforming principle.
