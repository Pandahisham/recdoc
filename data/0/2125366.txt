CHEMOPATHOLOGICAL STUDIES WITH COMPOUNDS OF ARSENIC 

 1. We have shown that the type of renal lesion produced by compounds of arsenic varies widely: while some arsenicals produce changes in which vascular injury predominates, others produce an equally dominant tubular injury. 2. In either of these groups the character and degree of the vascular or tubular injury produced by different compounds shows further variation, such that the lesions of different arsenicals of the same group are not identical. Each compound of arsenic that we have tested, therefore, produces a lesion-complex in the kidney that is relatively characteristic for that compound. 3. The mode and character of the action of arsenicals are dependent upon the chemical constitution of the compound.
