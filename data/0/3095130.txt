Revision of the stiletto fly genera Acupalpa Kröber and Pipinnipons Winterton (Diptera, Therevidae, Agapophytinae) using cybertaxonomic methods, with a key to Australasian genera

Academic editor: Martin Hauser
Australian stiletto flies of the sister-genera Acupalpa Kröber, 1912 and Pipinnipons Winterton, 2001 (Diptera: Therevidae: Agapophytinae) are revised. Twelve new species of Acupalpa are described, while Acupalpa imitans (White, 1915), comb. n. is transferred from Pipinnipons and Acupalpa albimanis (Kröber, 1914), comb. n. is transferred from Ectinorhynchus Macquart as a senior synonym of Acupalpa pollinosa Mann. The total number of species of Acupalpa is therefore increased to 19: Acupalpa albimanis (Kröber), comb. n., Acupalpa albitarsa Mann, Acupalpa boharti sp. n., Acupalpa divisa (Walker), Acupalpa dolichorhyncha sp. n., Acupalpa glossa sp. n., Acupalpa imitans (White), comb. n., Acupalpa irwini Winterton, Acupalpa melanophaeos sp. n., Acupalpa miaboolya sp. n., Acupalpa minuta sp. n., Acupalpa minutoides sp. n., Acupalpa notomelas sp. n., Acupalpa novayamarna sp. n., Acupalpa rostrata Kröber, Acupalpa semirufa Mann, Acupalpa westralica sp. n., Acupalpa yalgoo sp. n. and Acupalpa yanchep sp. n. Three new species of Pipinnipons are described, increasing the total number of species to five: Pipinnipons chauncyvallis sp. n., Pipinnipons fascipennis (Kröber), Pipinnipons kampmeierae sp. n., Pipinnipons kroeberi Winterton, and P. sphecoda sp. n. Pipinnipons and Acupalpa are rediagnosed in light of the new species presented herein and revised keys to species are included. A dichotomous key to genera of Australasian Therevidae is included. As an empirical example of cybertaxonomy, taxonomic descriptions were composed using a character matrix developed in Lucid Builder (in Structured Descriptive Data (SDD) format) to generate natural language descriptions supplemented by online specimen and image databases. Web resources are provided throughout the document including: a) links to high resolution colour images of all species on Morphbank, b) registration of authors, publications, taxon names and other nomenclatural acts in Zoobank, with assignment of Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) for each, c) links to Genbank accession records for DNA sequences, and d) assignment of LSIDs to specimen records with links to respective records in an online Therevidae specimen database.

The stiletto fly subfamily Agapophytinae is comprised of 23 described genera restricted in the Australasia region, yet with three additional described genera endemic to Chile and Argentina (Winterton 2006). Acupalpa Kröber, 1912 and Pipinnipons Winterton, 2001 are agapophytine sister genera found exclusively in Australia. Along with Agapophytus Guérin, 1831, these genera form a relatively derived clade characterized by an antenna with an elongate cylindrical scape and flagellum (Winterton 2000; Winterton et al. 2001). Agapophytus is differentiated from these genera by an elongate scape typically longer than, or equal to, the length of the flagellum, while in Acupalpa and Pipinnipons the scape is shorter than the flagellum. Acupalpa contains seven previously described species: Acupalpa albimanis (Kröber, 1914), comb. n. (=Acupalpa pollinosa Mann, 1929, syn. n.), Acupalpa albitarsa Mann, 1929, Acupalpa divisa (Walker, 1850), Acupalpa imitans (White, 1915), comb. n., Acupalpa irwini Winterton, 2000, Acupalpa rostrata Kröber, 1912, and Acupalpa semirufa Mann, 1929. Pipinnipons includes two previously described species: Pipinnipons fascipennis (Kröber, 1928) and Pipinnipons kroeberi Winterton, 2001.
Twelve new species of Acupalpa are described herein: Acupalpa boharti sp. n., Acupalpa dolichorhyncha sp. n., Acupalpa glossa sp. n., Acupalpa melanophaeos sp. n., Acupalpa miaboolya sp. n., Acupalpa minuta sp. n., Acupalpa minutoides sp. n., Acupalpa notomelas sp. n., Acupalpa novayamarna sp. n., Acupalpa westralica sp. n., Acupalpa yalgoo sp. n., and Acupalpa yanchep sp. n. Many of these species are from Western Australia, indicating a rich diversity of this genus in the western region of the continent. Addition of these new species significantly broadens the concept of Acupalpa beyond the characters defining the genus in previous treatments (i.e. Mann 1929; Winterton 2000; Winterton et al. 2001), therefore the genus and constituent species is rediagnosed herein and a revised key to species presented. Acupalpa imitans (White, 1915), comb. n. is transferred from Pipinnipons based on the discovery of new material matching the original description, while Acupalpa albimanis (Kröber, 1914), comb. n. is transferred from Ectinorhynchus Macquart, 1850 as the latter is a senior subjective synonym of Acupalpa pollinosa. Three new species of Pipinnipons are described, increasing the total number of species to five: Pipinnipons chauncyvallis sp. n., Pipinnipons fascipennis, Pipinnipons kampmeierae sp. n., Pipinnipons kroeberi, and Pipinnipons sphecoda sp. n. A key to Australasian stiletto fly genera is also included.
The modern taxonomic enterprise represents a gradual paradigm shift away from tedious traditional methods toward rapid, semi-automated ones (i.e. recently termed cybertaxonomy), with increased efficiency in data handling through the use of online databases for information such as label metadata, specimen images, name registration, semantic mark-up and natural language descriptions from character matrices (Winterton 2009). The concept itself is not new, with single zoological registries (e.g. Brown 1961) and rapid descriptive processes (e.g. Erwin and Johnson 2000) espoused previously, but the actual empirical use of informatics tools to enhance the taxonomic descriptive process (i.e. online databases) is only now becoming a reality. Several authors have embraced modern cybertaxonomic methods through the incorporation of such digital, web-based, resources in taxonomic descriptions (e.g. Pyle et al. 2008; Johnson et al. 2008; Deans and Kawada 2008; Miller et al. 2009; Winterton 2009; Penev et al. 2010; Blagoderov et al. 2010). The methods used by these authors, and this paper, are empirical examples of how digital tools can significantly speed the process of documenting biodiversity through rapid generation of natural language descriptions derived from matrix based character data in a standardized format suitable for multiple use (e.g. distributed morphological ontologies).
Adult morphological terminology follows McAlpine (1981) as modified by Winterton et al. (1999a) and Winterton (2006). Hauser and Irwin (2003) provide a convincing argument for the use of the term pubescence (sensu Nichols 1989) instead of pruinescence (sensu Winterton et al. 1999a) to describe the various types of microtrichia covering the adult body and is used here throughout the text. The term velutum (Winterton et al. 1999a) is retained to describe a particular type of very dense, unidirectional and reflective (i.e. velvet-like) microtrichia typically found on the male abdomen (silver coloured) or on the femora of agapophytine therevids (variously coloured but usually dark). Genitalia were macerated in 10% KOH to remove soft tissue, then rinsed in distilled water and dilute glacial acetic acid, and dissected in 80% ethanol. Genitalia preparations were placed in glycerine in a genitalia vial mounted on the pin beneath the specimen.
Types are deposited in the following institutions and collections: Queensland Museum (Brisbane) (QM), Australian Museum (Sydney) (AMS), Australian National Insect Collection (Canberra) (ANIC), Senckenberg Deutsches Entomologisches Institut, Müncheberg, Germany (DEI), University of Queensland Insect Collection (Brisbane) (UQIC), University of California, Davis, Bohart Museum (UCDC), Western Australian Museum (Perth) (WAM), Michael E. Irwin private collection [to be ultimately housed in the California Academy of Sciences] (MEIC/CAS), Greg Daniels private collection [to be ultimately housed in the Australian Museum] (GDCB/AMS), Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, (NMW), Harvard University Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Oxford University Museum of Natural History (OUMNH), University of California, Riverside (UCR), Universität von Hamburg Zoologisches Institut und Zoologisches Museum (ZMUH). All types have been examined. Numbers quoted with individual specimens as MEI000000 are unique identifiers in the therevid database MANDALA and are attached to each specimen as a yellow or white label (Kampmeier and Irwin 2009). Links are provided in this document to Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs) to specimen records with links to respective records in an online MANADALA Therevidae specimen database and Discover Life (http://www.discoverlife.org). Note that some web browsers are not able to read and format RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds and/or XML without additional software extensions or plug-ins. Details of current issues with select web browsers and LSID resolvers can be found on the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) LSID resolver website (http://lsid.tdwg.org/). Material examined lists were exported from MANDALA. Descriptions were constructed using Lucid Builder 3.5, using a matrix database of character states, which were then exported using a natural language function into XML and a text document. Links are provided to Genbank accession records for DNA sequences where available. Specimen images were taken using a digital camera with a series of images montaged using Helicon Focus (©HeliconSoft). Descriptions are aided by the provision of embedded URL links in the document to high-resolution digital images of all species in Morphbank. All nomenclatural acts are registered in Zoobank as per the recent proposed amendment to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature for a universal register for animal names (Polaszek et al.2005a,b; Pyle et al. 2008; ICZN 2008).
The following key to genera supersedes those by Winterton et al. (1999b) and Winterton et al. (2001) and includes all genera found throughout the region east of Wallace’s Line, incorporating landmasses such as Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, and eastern Indonesia. The enigmatic Taenogera genus group (sensu Winterton et al. 1999b) is herein included within an expanded concept of Agapophytinae (Winterton 2006). The subfamilies Xestomyzinae and Phycinae are absent from the Australasian region.

Acupalpa is a genus with some distinctive wasp mimicking species (Figs 1–2), often strikingly coloured with black and orange. The male terminalia are relatively conserved throughout both Acupalpa and Pipinnipons, and species identification is more easily and reliably accomplished using external characters of either sex. Closely related to Pipinnipons and Agapophytus, Acupalpa can be distinguished by the elongate, cylindrical antennae, scape not longer than flagellum, face usually expansive and protruding, and palpi that are acuminate or narrowly cylindrical. The latter two characters specifically differentiate Acupalpa from Pipinnipons, as the face is always narrow and the palpi spatulate in Pipinnipons. Agapophytus is separated from Pipinnipons and Acupalpa by the length of the scape ranging from relatively equal length, to significantly longer than the flagellum.

Ectinorhynchus albimanis is herein transferred to Acupalpa with Acupalpa pollinosa becoming a junior synonym of Acupalpa albimanis comb. n. Mann (1928) redescribed Ectinorhynchus albimanis based on a series of specimens, but clearly did not examine the type, as his redescription does not match that in Kröber (1914) nor reflect characteristics of the type. Acupalpa albimanis is morphological similar to Acupalpa albitarsa and Acupalpa yanchep sp. n. The colouration of abdomen and tarsi is diagnostic for this species.

The distinctive tarsal colouration of Acupalpa albitarsa and the closely related Acupalpa yanchep sp. n., separates these species from all other Acupalpa. Acupalpa albitarsa is an eastern species while Acupalpa yanchep sp. n. is western. Females are difficult to distinguish but males differ in the shape of the frons and in general body shape and size. The white patterning of the scutum is less pronounced in this species.

The type of Phycus imitans was kept in the G.H. Hardy collection, which was moved from Brisbane to Katoomba, but is now apparently lost or destroyed by pests. While not stating whether he actually examined the type, Mann (1929) redescribed this species in Agapophytus based on an unjustified allotype designation and associated female from southeast Queensland. Winterton et al. (2001) transferred the species to Pipinnipons based on the description of White (1915) and the specimens referred to by Mann (1929). The two specimens examined by Mann (1929) as putative Acupalpa imitans were located in the QM collection and no further material has been collected from Tasmania. Based on the discovery of new material from southeast Queensland more closely matching the original description by White (1915) than any other material examined (including the allotype designated by Mann (1929)), a male specimen (MEI165187) is herein designated as a Neotype to stabilise the concept of the species. This problematic species has characteristics that indicate a closer relationship to species of Acupalpa (particularly palpi shape) and is herein transferred from Pipinnipons.

Pipinnipons  Winterton, 2001: 205. Type species: Pipinnipons kroeberi Winterton, 2001: 206.
Antenna elongate, cylindrical, total length slightly longer than or equal to head length; scape shorter than flagellum; frons flat, smooth; face as narrow strip below antenna, glabrous; palpus spatulate apically; mouthparts short; occiput with single row of postocular setae immediately laterad of ocellar tubercle in male, multiple rows in female; wing banded infuscate or hyaline; setae absent on wing vein R1; cell m3 closed; elongate velutum patches on fore and hind femora; femora without macrosetae; single type of setal pile on femora, setae not appressed; prosternal furrow without setae; mid coxa without setae on posterior surface; post spiracular pile absent; gonocoxites with velutum patch on ventral surface (Fig. 24); articulated gonocoxal process present; hypandrium present; ventral apodeme of parameral sheath forked; dorsal apodeme of parameral sheath ‘T’-shaped; three spermathecae in female; spermathecal sac present, usually with two smaller, additional lobes and/or outer reticulated lobes along length; spermathecal ducts joining common duct before bursa; female with A1 and A2 acanthophorite spines well developed; female sternite 8 emarginate along posterior margin.
Pipinnipons is a distinctive genus of wasp mimicking therevids, often with metallic pubescence, yellow and black marking and banded wings (Fig. 23). It can be distinguished among related genera by the elongate, cylindrical antennae, scape not longer than flagellum, narrow face and palpi spatulate. The latter two characters specifically differentiate Pipinnipons from Acupalpa, as the face is broadly rounded, often produced, and the palpi are acuminate or narrowly cylindrical in Acupalpa. While the mouthparts are of variable length in Acupalpa (and often elongate and forward projecting), the mouthparts of Pipinnipons are always relatively short. As stated in the comments under Acupalpa, Agapophytus is separated from Pipinnipons and Acupalpa by the length of the scape ranging from relatively equal length, to significantly longer than the flagellum. The modified setae patch on abdominal tergite 2 mentioned by Winterton et al. (2001) as a characteristic of Pipinnipons is not present in all the new species described here, and is no longer considered diagnostic for the genus as it is also found sporadically in other, unrelated genera such as Neodialineura Mann, 1928 and Bonjeania Irwin and Lyneborg, 1989. The male terminalia are relatively conserved throughout the genus, and species identification is more easily done using external characters of both sexes. Pipinnipons is distributed along coastal eastern Australia from northern Queensland to Tasmania.
