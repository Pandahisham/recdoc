Changes in the pattern of deliberate self-poisoning presenting at Craigavon Area Hospital: 1976, 1986 and 1991.

Deliberate self-poisoning presenting at Craigavon Area Hospital in 1991 was examined and compared to the years 1976 and 1986. Self-poisoning has not declined over the 15 year period 1976-1991. The reduction in the use of benzodiazepines, and increase in paracetamol, previously reported, continues. Possible reasons for this are examined, in relation to local and national drug prescribing.
