Both primary leiomyosarcoma of bone and sarcoma arising in association with a bone infarct are rare events. In this casereport we describe for the first time a case of leiomyosarcoma arising in a bone infarct. The tumour arose in a medullaryinfarct in the proximal femur of an elderly patient. As in other cases of sarcoma arising in a bone infarct, the prognosis waspoor, the patient dying within 6 months of diagnosis.
