The Effects of Cognitive Activity Combined with Active Extremity Exercise onBalance, Walking Activity, Memory Level and Quality of Life of an Older Adult Sample withDementia

 [Purpose] The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of cognitiveactivity combined with active physical exercise for a sample of older adults withdementia. [Subjects] A convenience sample of 30 patients with dementia (Mini-Mental StateExamination score between 16 and 23) was used. Participants were randomly allocated to oneof two groups: cognitive activity combined with physical exercise CAE, n=11), and onlycognitive activity CA, n=9). [Methods] Both groups participated in a therapeutic exerciseprogram for 30 minutes, three days a week for 12 weeks. The CAE group performed anadditional exercise for 30 minutes a day, three days a week for 12 weeks. A Wii BalanceBoard (WBB, Nintendo, Japan) was used to evaluate postural sway as an assessment ofbalance. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES) were usedto assess dynamic balance abilities. The Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG) was used to assessgait, and the Digit Span Test (DST) and 7 Minute Screening Test (7MST) were used tomeasure memory performance. The Mini-Mental Status Exam-Korean version (MMSE-K), KennySelf-Care Evaluation (KSCE), and Short Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used toassess quality of life (QOL). [Results] There were significant beneficial effects of thetherapeutic program on balance (velocity in EOWB, path length in ECNB, BBS, and MMFE), QOL(MMSE-KC, GDS, KSCE), and memory performance (DSB) in the CAE group compared to CA group,and between pre-test and post-test. [Conclusion] A 12-week CAE program resulted inimprovements in balance, memory and QOL. Therefore, some older adults with dementia havethe ability to acquire effective skills relevant to daily living.

Increased rates of dementia are a problem for the aging population around the world. Theloss of brain function due to dementia has a variety of causes, and results in emotional andbehavioral problems, social and occupational dysfunction, personality changes, anddifficulties with intellectually complex issues1). Patients with dementia associated with aging have problems withmemory, thinking, orientation, judgment, and activities of daily living due to neuraldysfunction2).
Furthermore, dementia coincides with a decline in physical and cognitive activity3). Changes caused by dementia are oftenrelated to difficulties with navigating one’s living environment, the ability to assesssituations and make decisions, and environmental adaption4). Dementia is an irreversible syndrome resulting from neuraldegeneration. Cognitive impairment and behavioral interruption are major symptoms that areassociated with negative outcomes. These symptoms are a major target for intervention toimprove patients’ quality of life5).Several studies have shown that exercise has a positive effect on cognitive functioning ofboth healthy older adults and patients with dementia. Exercise can be specifically helpfulfor enhancing the independent recovery of cognitive and behavioral functions of patientswith dementia6).
According to a recent meta-analysis, exercise was useful for improving the cardiovascularand motor functions of normal older adult populations. Exercise also provided a significantincrease in cognitive speed, vision, hearing, and concentration. The same study alsoreported a positive effect on complex movement. Therefore, exercise could lead to somecognitive recovery, as well as prevent further deterioration7).
The results of other studies5, 8) have suggested that the integration of a cognition andphysical exercise program is helpful for individuals with dementia. A study by Tappen etal.9) had older adults with dementiaperform three interventions: “conversation, walking, and conversation and walking”. Theirresults show that conversation combined with walking was the most effective at improvingcognitive and motor functions.
Harlein et al.10) reported on theimportance of combined exercise and cognitive training for the restoration of independencethrough increased muscle strength, functional ability, and reduction in fall risk, andshowed that physical activity is associated with the cardiovascular risk factors of subjectswith dementia.
Lee YM and Bak NH11) also observed thatan integrated program of exercise and cognitive training is better way of preventing theloss of cognitive abilities than a traditional intervention.
The main benefit of an integrated exercise and cognitive therapy program is to increaseactivity and participation, as well increase neural plasticity. Improvements in physicalactivity and cognitive function can also help reduce neural degenerative structures, such asbeta-amyloidal plaques and tangles. Alleviating cognitive and functional changes, to aidindependent living might help individuals with dementia preserve their QOL12). Thus, the purpose of the present studywas to investigate the effects of combined exercise and cognitive training on balance, gait,and memory of patients with dementia to see if such an intervention can help improve theirQOL.
A total of 30 older adults patients with dementia, living in a long-term care facility wererecruited for this study. The patients understood the content of the study and agreed toparticipate. The subjects provided their informed consent to participation in this study.Approval for the study protocol was received from the Sahmyook University InstitutionalReview Board. Table 1Table 1.

This study used a randomized, two-group, pretest-posttest design. After the pretest,patients were randomly assigned to either the cognitive activity with exercise group (CAE,n=15) or the cognitive activity group (CA, n=15). An individual judged unsuitable to assessthe impact or progress of the training randomized patients by selecting sealed envelopes onehour prior to the start of the intervention. Fewer than 80% of the patients were availablefor the final analysis due to poor concentration during the intervention. This left us with11 participants in the CAE group and 9 participants in the CA group for full analysis.
All groups received conventional physical therapy (5 times a week for 30 min). The CAEgroup received the same intervention as the CA group, with the addition of a cyclingexercise (3 times a week for 20 min), during their cognitive activity session (3 times aweek for 20 min). Inclusion criteria were as follows: The ability to communicate andunderstand the tasks, a Mini-Mental Status Examination score between 16 and 23 points, novisual field deficits, no known musculoskeletal conditions that would have affectedpatients’ ability to walk safely, and the ability to walk independently with or without theuse of an assistive device. Exclusion criteria included having an unregulated cardiacdisorder, or structural or functional limb impairments.
To complete the complex cognitive training and exercise at the same time, the traininggroup patients rhythmically repeated simple actions to build up reactionary movement. Basedon their level of dementia patients simply continued to repeat the training at low intensityfor 30 minutes, three times a week for 12 weeks. Cognitive training included sequentialmemory recall tasks used in previous studies13).
The cognitive training group performed the same tasks at the same time using a “Three-backverbal working memory”. The measure used in the current study were the Berg Balance Scale(BBS), the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale (MFES), the Timed Up and Go (TUG), the Digit SpanForward (DSF), the Digit Span Backward (DSB), the Mini-Mental Status Exam-Korean version(MMSE-K), the Kenny Self-Care Evaluation (KSCE), the Short Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).Patients performed memory, balance, gait, and QOL tasks before and after the intervention. AWii Balance Board (Nintendo, Japan) with Balancia software, and the Berg Balance Scale wereused to assess each static and dynamic balance, respectively. The Modified Falls EfficacyScale (MFES) was used as an additional evaluation tool.
On the Wii Balance Board, balance was assessed under four conditions feet apart with eyesopen (EOWB), feet together with eyes open (EONB), feet apart with eyes closed (ECWB), feettogether with eyes closed (ECNB). Each position was measured three times14). For the current study, the sampling fordata collection was 50 Hz and 12 HZ (using a low pass filter). Measurements were taken for15 and 30 seconds with a 60-second rest between each position. The reliability had an ICCranging from 0.66–0.94, and the pressure points on the center of pressure validity had anICC ranging from 0.77–0.8914, 15). The TUG was used to assess dynamic balance ability13, 15).
The Korean-Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test (Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale,KWAI) was used to measure cognitive ability, specifically working memory performanceassessed with the DSF and DSB. Furthermore, orientation checks, memory check, visuospatialassessment, and verbal fluency were examined with the 7-Minute Screening Test (7MST). Theshort version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to assess depressivesymptoms. Kenny’s activities of daily living scale (KSCE; a QOL measure) was used to examinepatient’s ability to perform physical activities at home.
SPSS version 12.0 software was used for statistical analyses. We confirmed the normality ofthe data using non-parametric assays (between-groups: Mann-Whitney test; within groups:Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test) between the groups. The level of significance was p < 0.05in all the analyses.
The general characteristics of the 20 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria aresummarized in Table 1. There were no significantdifferences in the pre- and post-intervention measures between the CAE and CA groups.
The pre- and post-intervention values of the static balance amplitudes are summarized inTable 2Table 2.

In summary, static balance (path length in ECNB, velocity in EOWB) dynamic balanceabilities (BBS and MFES), memory (DSB), and quality of life (GDS, KSCE) showed significantdifferences between the CAE and CA groups (p < 0.05).
Most individuals with dementia suffer reductions in proprioceptive sensation, as well as inthe visual, vestibular and memory functions. Therefore, such individuals can suffer fromissues related to both cognition and gait. Furthermore memory decline is a hallmark of theaging process16).
Harlein and Yeol YY3, 10) showed the impact of balance ability on dementia patients. Sixtypatients performed both cognitive and physical exercise training. This interventionincreased balance and cognitive performance in the cognitive activity exercise group ascompared to the control group.
Penades17) also examined improvements incognitive function using an integrated training program and found significant improvementsin task execution and attentional function. Another study showed that cognitive trainingcombined with exercise produced increased concentration and attentional ability as comparedto when only cognitive training was provided18).
Tappen RM19) suggested that anintervention that combines cognitive training with physical activity is necessary toincrease active participation in the intervention and improve aspects of daily living.
In this study, we used an intervention combining cognitive training with physical exerciseto improve balance, gait, memory, and QOL. After the 12-week intervention, the CAE groupshowed significant improvement as, compared to the CA group in all the measures studied.
The COP balance measures only revealed differences in velocity in EOWB and path length inECNB. The BBS and MFES scores significantly improved for the CAE group. In contrast toprevious studies, the results of the present study for static balance did not revealsignificant group differences. One possible reason for this could be the large individualdifferences in SD of measurement shown by the participants in this study. One plausiblecause of the cognitive changes observed among the dementia patients is the fact that manysuffer from emotional and psychological problems, and are a burden on their family, whichcan lead to nursing home admittance. Depression is known to increase among patients who arein long-term nursing care19, 20). Psychological problems particularly depression anddementia are common in long term nursing care. Studies of successful aging show thatlifestyle habits like having physical activity, influence the physical and mental health ofdementia patients21). The present studycombined improving levels of sustained attention, using three-back working memory, withincreasing activity of elderly patients with dementia by CAE. Interventions tailored to thepatient on modified and sustainable movement.
The results of the DSB and 7MST show significant differences between the two groups (p <0.05). The variation between results of the groups in this study might not have differed asmuch if a smaller number of assessment tools used for hospitalization for dementia had beenused22).
We recommend taking advantage of social psychological approaches to properly managephysical and cognitive functions, to help improve the QQL of suffering from dementia.Increasing QOL has been the main area of interest for social policy interventions.
In this study, the CAE group showed improved GDS and KSCE scores (p < 0.05) and hadimproved scores as compared to the CA group (p < 0.05). The present study demonstratedthe beneficial effects of cognitive activity combined with physical exercise on balance,gait, memory, and QOL. In conclusion, cognitive activity combined with physical activity canhelp improve balance, memory function, and QOL of individuals with dementia.
