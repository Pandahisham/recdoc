The Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic stage candidate                        vaccine RTS,S is being developed for protection of young children against                        malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. RTS,S formulated with the liposome based                        adjuvant AS01E or the oil-in-water based adjuvant                            AS02D induces P. falciparum circumsporozoite                        (CSP) antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses which have been                        associated with protection in the experimental malaria challenge model in                        adults.
This study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity induced                        over a 19 month period by three vaccination schedules (0,1-, 0,1,2- and                        0,1,7-month) of RTS,S/AS01E and RTS,S/AS02D in                        children aged 5–17 months in two research centers in Ghana. Control                        Rabies vaccine using the 0,1,2-month schedule was used in one of two study                        sites.
Whole blood antigen stimulation followed by intra-cellular cytokine staining                        showed RTS,S/AS01E induced CSP specific CD4 T cells producing                        IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Higher T cell responses were induced by a                        0,1,7-month immunization schedule as compared with a 0,1- or 0,1,2-month                        schedule. RTS,S/AS01E induced higher CD4 T cell responses as                        compared to RTS,S/AS02D when given on a 0,1,7-month schedule.
These findings support further Phase III evaluation of                        RTS,S/AS01E. The role of immune effectors and immunization                        schedules on vaccine protection are currently under evaluation.

Malaria, caused by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum,                affects millions of people annually. Infants and young children in Africa carry most                of the disease burden. P. falciparum has a complex life cycle                including several developmental stages in its human host. The RTS,S malaria                candidate vaccine, which has recently entered Phase III testing, targets the                    P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a                pre-erythrocytic stage antigen. Implemented in the Expanded Program of Immunization                (EPI), together with existing control measures such as wide spread use of                insecticide treated nets, vector control and use of new generation anti-malaria                drugs, RTS,S may contribute to sustained malaria control.
The vaccine antigen contains the central tandem repeats and carboxy-terminal regions                of CSP fused to the N-terminal of hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Combination of                this fusion protein with native hepatitis B surface antigen results in the                spontaneous formation of RTS,S virus-like particles [1]. This antigen formulated with the                AS02 adjuvant induces CSP specific adaptive immune responses and protection against                infection in controlled parasite challenge studies [2]–[5] as well in semi-immune adults,                children and infants living in malaria-endemic regions [6]–[11]. The AS02 adjuvant is based on                an oil-in-water emulsion combined to the TLR4 ligand monophosporyl lipid A (MPL) and                the QS21 saponin fraction of Quillaja saponaria                [1]. A new RTS,S                formulation containing the AS01 adjuvant and consisting of MPL, QS21 and liposomes                was recently selected as an alternative to RTS,S/AS02 on the basis of its ability to                induce comparable, or better, CSP-specific antibody responses and greater T cell                responses in small animal models and non-human primates than did AS02 [12], [13]. This effect                was confirmed in a Phase IIa controlled parasite challenge study performed in                malaria naïve adults at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research where,                compared to RTS,S/AS02, RTS,S/AS01 was shown to be well tolerated, to induce strong                humoral and cellular immune responses, and to improve protection against P.                    falciparum challenge [5]. Efficacy of RTS,S/AS01E (the pediatric                formulation of RTS,S/AS01) against malaria was then evaluated in children, with                favourable results [14], and the possibility to safely co-administer                    RTS,S/AS01E and EPI vaccines has been shown [15].
Both humoral and cellular immune responses play a key role in protection against                    Plasmodium infection in mice [16]–[21]. However, the relevance of these                observations to the host-parasite relationship in humans remains to be demonstrated.                Recent evidence indicates that, in adults, protection is associated with high titers                of CSP-specific antibodies and CD4 T cell responses [5]. As pediatric populations are                particularly susceptible to malaria, it is important to investigate humoral and                cellular immune responses in a younger age group to provide a better understanding                of the immune mechanisms which mediate protection following RTS,S vaccination.
The present study was designed to document the safety and immunogenicity of                    RTS,S/AS01E and RTS, S/AS02D (the pediatric formulation of                RTS,S/AS02) in 5–17 month old children at two different sites in Ghana. Three                schedules selected on the basis of compatibility with the existing EPI vaccination                program were evaluated for induction of anti-CSP antibodies and T cell responses.                Results of safety and humoral immunogenicity evaluations have been reported                previously [22]. Briefly, both RTS,S/AS02D and                    RTS,S/AS01E were well tolerated and induced high titers of anti-CSP                and anti-HBs antibodies. Recipients of RTS,S/AS01E had higher peak                anti-CSP antibody responses for all 3 schedules than did recipients of                    RTS,S/AS02D. Three-dose schedules induced higher antibody levels than                2-dose schedules. The peak antibody response following a 0,1,2-month schedule was                higher than following a 0,1,7-month schedule, but area under the curve analyses of                anti-CSP antibodies for the overall study period were comparable between the 0,1,2-                and 0,1,7-month schedules for both vaccine formulations. T-cell responses, using                whole blood antigen-stimulation followed by intracellular cytokine staining, are                reported here.
The supporting CONSORT checklist for this trial is available as supporting                information; see Checklist S1. The protocol of this trial was posted with a previous                publication (Protocol S1                [22]).
The protocol was approved by relevant ethical and institutional review boards as                    described previously [22]. The trial was undertaken according to the                    International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice guidelines and                    was monitored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals. The study was overseen by a                    formally constituted Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) operating under a                    charter. Written informed consent was obtained from each child's parent(s)                    or guardian(s) before study procedures were initiated. Illiterate parents or                    guardians indicated consent using a thumbprint, and a signature was obtained                    from a literate witness.
The design of this trial [http://clinicaltrials.gov:                    NCT00360230] and CONSORT flowchart have been described in detail previously                        [22].                    No changes were made to the protocol after ethical approval. Briefly, the trial                    was a Phase II randomized, controlled, partially-blind study. A total of 540                    eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of three study groups in each                    study site (Figure 1). In                    one site rabies vaccine (Purified chick embryo cell-culture rabies vaccine;                    Chiron Behring GmbH, Marburg, Germany), administered following a 0,1,2-month                    schedule, was used as a control. Blood samples for assessment of cell-mediated                    immune (CMI) responses were collected one month after the last vaccine dose in                    each vaccination schedule (peak response) and at month 19 of the study. The                    study was conducted in two locations in Ghana, about 200 km apart: one                    coordinated from Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research/School of Medical                    Sciences (KCCR/SMS), Kumasi, with the field site in the town of Agogo and                    clinical activities centered at the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital, and the other                    one in the Kintampo area, with clinical activities centered at the Kintampo                    Health Research Centre (KHRC) and Kintampo Hospital. Malaria transmission in                    both areas is intense and perennial. Insecticide treated nets were distributed                    to potential study participants at screening.
Triangles represent timing of vaccination for 0,1-, 0,1,2- and                            0,1,7-month schedules (RTS,S/AS01E, RTS,S/AS02D or                            Rabies vaccine); arrows represent timing of blood sampling. In both                            research centers, each study group included 45 individuals.
Serum antibodies to the NANP repeat region of CSP (B cell epitope) were measured                    by a standard, validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using plates                    adsorbed with the recombinant antigen R32LR that contains the sequence                    [NVDP(NANP)152LR], at a GSK validated laboratory (CEVAC, University of                    Ghent, Belgium). Titers were calculated using a reference standard curve with a                    4 parameter logistic fitting algorithm and expressed in EU/ml, with cut-off for                    seropositivity of 0.5 EU/ml [23].
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) was used to assess cell-mediated immune                    responses, using an adaptation of previously described methods [24].                    Immediately after blood collection in Lithium-heparin tubes, whole blood samples                    were stimulated in vitro with a pool of 15-mer peptides                    overlapping by 11 amino acids and covering the CSP antigen in RTS,S (1.25                    µg/ml), medium (negative control) or phytohemagglutin A (PHA, positive                    control), in the presence of anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d antibodies (BD                    Biosciences, Belgium). After 2 hours of incubation at 37°C, Brefeldin A (BD                    Biosciences) was added, and samples were incubated overnight. Red blood cells                    were then lysed and remaining cells were washed, fixed and frozen at                    −80°C until subsequent analysis. After thawing, cells were washed and                    stained using peridinin-chlorophyll (PerCP)-conjugated anti-CD4 (BD Biosciences)                    and allophycocyanin (APC)-H7 conjugated anti-CD8 antibodies (BD Biosciences).                    Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with the Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer kit                    (Pharmingen), and stained with APC conjugated anti-IL-2 (Pharmingen),                    fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-IFN-γ (Pharmingen),                    phycoerythrin (PE) cyanin-7 (Cy7)-conjugated anti-TNF-α (Pharmingen) and                    PE-conjugated anti-CD154 (CD40L) (Pharmingen). Cells were washed, re-suspended                    in fetal-calf-serum (FCS)-containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and                    analyzed on a BD™ LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis was                    performed using BD™ Diva software (BD Biosciences). The ICS results were                    expressed as the number of CSP-specific CD4/CD8 T cells expressing IL-2,                    IFN-γ, TNF-α or CD40L per million CD4/CD8 T cells. The gating strategy                    and an illustrative example of cytokine response are shown in Figure 2. The analysis of CD4                    T cell polyfunctionality was conducted using FlowJo software (Tree Star                    Inc).
Whole-blood intracellular cytokine detection by flow cytometry was                            performed following overnight stimulation with medium (negative                            control), CSP and PHA (positive control). (A) CD4 or CD8 T cells were                            identified from a lymphocyte gate on an SSC-FSC plot. (B)                                IL-2+, TNF-α+,                                IFN-γ+, and CD40-ligand (not shown) CD4 T cells                            and CD8 T cells (not shown) were counted. The unstimulated sample                            (medium) shows background levels of cytokine production, while the                            stimulation with PHA (positive control) shows strong production of IL-2,                            TNF-α, or IFN-γ by CD4 T cells. The CSP stimulated illustrative                            sample from an RTS,S/AS01E vaccinated individual shows                            production of IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ by CD4 T cells.
The analysis of CMI responses was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.                    The frequency of CSP-specific CD4, CD8 T cells expressing at least CD40L,                    IFN-γ, IL-2 or TNF-α was summarized for each group at peak (one month                    post final dose) and at month 19. Descriptive statistics (mean, median,                    quartiles) were tabulated by group and, within schedules, a comparison of                    adjuvants was made using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The between schedule comparison                    and the RTS,S/AS01E versus rabies comparison were done using the                    mixed model procedure adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni                    method to correct for type I error. A responder was defined as a subject with an                    outcome that was equal or greater than the geometric mean + 3 standard                    deviations (on the log 10 scale) of background stimulation for each cytokine.                    Spearman rank correlations were used to assess the correlations between the log                    of CSP-specific CD4 IL-2 and CD4 TNF-α responses for each schedule and both                    vaccine formulations with antibody levels at peak (one month post final dose)                    and at month 19.
As a benchmark, the RTS,S/AS01E T cell response was first compared to                    the response seen in the rabies group. Only data from Kintampo are presented                    here, as rabies vaccine was not administered in Agogo. Figure 3 presents the frequency of                    CSP-specific CD4 T cells expressing at least IL-2, TNF-α or IFN-γ.                    Compared to the rabies group, responses are modestly but significantly higher in                    the RTS,S/AS01E vaccinated group at peak (one month post last dose)                    and at month 19 of the study. There was no significant difference in the                    expression of CD40L between both groups at either time point. No vaccine-induced                    CSP-specific CD8 T cell responses were detected (data not shown).
CSP-specific CD4 T cell responses in infants and children aged 5–17                            months from Kintampo, vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E or rabies                            vaccine according to a 0,1,2-month immunization schedule. Results are                            expressed as the median (with Q1 and Q3) number of CSP-specific CD4 T                            cells per 106 CD4 T cells. The number of subjects per group                            and percentage responders (defined as a response that was equal or                            greater than the geometric mean + 3 standard deviations (on the log                            10 scale) of background stimulation) is indicated. P-values were                            calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. *** P<0.001,                            ** P<0.01, * P<0.05.
A more detailed characterization of cytokine expression by CSP-specific CD4 T                    cells in the RTS,S/AS01E vaccinated children from Kintampo showed                    that at one month post third vaccination the majority of CSP-specific CD4 T                    cells were expressing IL-2 only. Polyfunctional CSP-specific CD4 T cells were                    essentially IL-2+ TNF-α+ CD4 T cells and to                    a lesser extent CD40L+ IL-2+                        TNF-α+ CD4 T cells (Figure 4).
Polyfunctional profiles of CSP-specific CD4 T cells expressing any                            combination of immune markers among IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and                            CD40L in infants and children aged 5–17 months from Kintampo,                            vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E or rabies vaccine according to a                            0,1,2-month immunization schedule. Data are represented as background                            subtracted geometric mean number of CSP-specific CD4 T cells expressing                            any combination of IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and/or CD40L per                                106 CD4 T cells, with 95% CI (A). The pie chart                            represents the proportion of CSP-specific CD4 T cells expressing 1, 2, 3                            or 4 immune markers amongst IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and CD40L from                                RTS,S/AS01E recipients (B).
For the comparison of CSP-specific CD4 T cell responses induced by                        RTS,S/AS01E and RTS,S/AS02D, data from the two study                    centers for the 0,1- and 0,1,7-month schedules were pooled. Data for the                    0,1,2-month schedule are not shown as RTS,S/AS02D was not                    administered on a 0,1,2-month schedule in Kintampo.
When administered in a three dose regimen following a 0,1,7-month schedule,                        RTS,S/AS01E induced higher CSP-specific                        IFN-γ+ CD4 T cell responses as compared to                        RTS,S/AS02D one month after the last vaccination, but not at                    month 19. The frequency of IL-2+ and TNF-α+                    CD4 T cells was greater in RTS,S/AS01E recipients than in                        RTS,S/AS02D recipients at month 19, but not one month after                    vaccination (Table 1).
N (%): Number of subjects per group and percentage responders                                (defined as a response ≥ geometric mean + 3 standard                                deviations (on the log 10 scale) of background stimulation).
M (Q1–Q3): Results are expressed as the median (Q1 and Q3)                                number of CSP-specific CD4 T cells per 106 CD4 T                                cells.P-values for comparison of RTS,S/AS01E and                                    RTS,S/AS02D were calculated using the mixed model                                procedure adjusted for multiple comparison using the Bonferroni                                method to correct for type I error.
When considering the two dose regimen (0,1-month), no marked differences in the                    CSP-specific T cell response induced by the two vaccine formulations were seen,                    other than a higher frequency of CD40L+ CD4 T cell at month 19                    after RTS,S/AS02D vaccination.
An important objective of this study was the comparison of different vaccination                    schedules compatible with integration into the existing EPI vaccination program.                    In a previous report we have shown that anti-CSP antibody titers were higher in                    groups vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E using a three-dose rather than                    two-dose regimen [22]. CD4 T cell responses following vaccination according                    to different vaccination schedules with RTS,S/AS01E (the formulation                    evaluated according to all 3 schedules in both study centers), are presented in                        Table 2. When                    considering responses one month after the last vaccination, no substantial                    differences were observed between a 0,1-month vaccination schedule and a                    0,1,2month vaccination schedule, but compared to both other vaccination                    schedules, the 0,1,7-month schedule induced higher CD4 T cell responses. At                    month 19 however, only the TNF-α response was still higher in the                    0,1,7-month schedule as compared to the 0,1-month schedule. Similar results were                    observed for the RTS,S/AS02D formulation, when considering data from                    Agogo only (where RTS,S/AS02D was evaluated according to all 3                    vaccine schedules, data not shown).
M (Q1–Q3): Results are expressed as the median (Q1 and Q3)                                number of CSP-specific CD4 T cells per 106 CD4 T                                cells.
P-values: Comparison were done using the mixed model procedure                                adjusted for multiple comparison using the Bonferroni method to                                correct for type I error.
As IL-2 and TNF-α were the cytokines most clearly activated following antigen                    re-stimulation of whole blood from RTS,S/AS01E or                        RTS,S/AS02D vaccinated infants and young children, the                    associations between CSP-specific IL-2+ and                        TNF-α+ CD4 T cell responses and the CSP-specific                    antibody responses were investigated using Spearman rank correlation index. As                    presented in detail in Table                        3, weak but statistically significant or borderline correlations were                    found between peak IL-2+ and TNF+ CD4 T cell                    responses and serum anti-CSP antibodies at the time of the peak response and at                    month 19 in children in the RTS,S/AS01E 0,1,2-month schedule and in                    the RTS,S/AS02D 0,1,7-month schedule groups.
The relationship between CSP-specific CD4 T cell response and                                CSP-specific antibody level was analyzed using Spearman's rank                                correlation and associated p-values are shown.
In this study we have investigated antigen-specific T cell responses in infants and                young children aged 5–17 months, vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01E or                    RTS,S/AS02D according to three different immunization schedules. The                rationale for investigating cellular responses to the CSP antigen in field studies                is based on a growing body of evidence suggesting an important role of vaccine                induced T cell responses targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of malaria infection                in the protection provided. This was initially demonstrated in experimental animal                models [20]. In                human adults, an association between vaccine efficacy and both anti-CSP humoral and                CD4 T cell response was shown in individuals vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 and                RTS,S/AS02 who then went through an experimental sporozoite challenge [5]. Other vaccine                candidates target protection from CD8 responses targeting pre-erythrocytic antigens                    [25]
This study has shown that RTS,S/AS01E vaccination of infants and children                induces CSP-specific CD4 T cells expressing IL-2, TNF-α or IFN-γ. These                results are in line with previously shown RTS,S/AS01 induced responses in adults                    [5].                Quantitative differences and the absence of CD40-L induction may be related to                physiologic differences, or to the fact that the pediatric assay uses whole blood                antigen stimulation while PBMC were used in adults. As in most other RTS,S                vaccination studies, CSP-specific CD8 T cells were not detected, but it is possible                that they may not be detected in peripheral blood one month after vaccination, while                still playing a role in vivo.
Whether activated CSP-specific CD4 T cells have a direct anti-parasite effector role,                or whether they act indirectly by supporting other effector functions remains to be                demonstrated. A direct role of activated CD4 T cells against infected liver cells is                possible, as several cell types present in the liver, such as Kupffer cells, liver                dendritic cells, endothelial cells and hepatocytes themselves can express MHC Class                II molecules necessary for antigen presentation to CD4 T cells [20]. CD4 T cells, through the                expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ, could contribute to the elimination of                intracellular Plasmodia                [18], [20], [26], or through                other yet uncharacterized effector mechanism(s). CD4-derived IL-2 could also help NK                or CD8 T cells to clear parasites as has been shown in blood-stage infection [27].
Whether or not they display intrinsic protective effector functions, CD4 T cells are                likely to contribute to antibody production. In this study, weak but significant                correlations were found between the anti-CSP CD4 T cell and antibody responses. This                observation is in line with the well known helper T cell function, providing help to                B cells, promoting antibody class switch, affinity maturation and induction of                memory B cells [28], [29], thus potentially contributing to antibody-mediated                protection [30]. IL-2 production by CSP-specific CD4 T cells could play                an important role in the maintenance of circulating anti-CSP antibodies [31].
This study and previous trials in adults and children showed that the AS01 formulated                RTS,S vaccine induces higher anti-CSP antibody responses than the AS02 formulation                    [5], [22], [32], [33]. In a trial                in malaria-naïve American adults, superior T cell responses, humoral responses                and a trend towards higher protection against P. falciparum                infection in the experimental challenge model were also shown after RTS,S/AS01                vaccination, as compared to RTS,S/AS02 [5]. In the study described here,                the adjuvant comparison generally favored RTS,S/AS01E when considering                the IFN-γ response at one month after the last vaccination and the IL-2 and                TNF-α response at study end in the 0,1,7-month schedule. This was not seen when                comparing the vaccine formulations in the 0,1-month schedule. Overall, when                considering the humoral [22] and cellular immunogenicity data, the results from this                trial are supportive of the selection of RTS,S/AS01E for further Phase                III evaluation.
For a new public health intervention in Sub-Saharan Africa, implementation into an                existing delivery program is a key success factor. For a new vaccine, it is                important that the immunization schedule be compatible with the existing EPI                program. In this study, three immunization schedules were evaluated: a 0,1,2-month                schedule that could be delivered together with the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,                    Haemophilus influenza type b and hepatitis B vaccines                (DTP-HepB/Hib), a 0,1-month schedule which would have the advantage of only two                doses, and a 0,1,7-month schedule with a delayed third dose that could be                administered with the measles vaccination in the infant EPI program.
A study of 1 to 4 year old children in Gabon showed that anti-CSP antibody levels                after three doses of RTS,S/AS01E or RTS,S/AS02D were higher                than those obtained after two doses [32]. This was confirmed in the present trial, as presented in                the initial report [22], and in a study of RTS,S/AS01E administered to                infants together with EPI vaccines [15]. A three dose immunization                schedule was therefore selected for further RTS,S/AS01E evaluation.
In the present study, although the humoral responses induced by a 0,1,2- and a                0,1,7-month schedule were comparable in terms of area under the curve for anti-CSP                antibody titer evolution over time, the peak (one month post last dose) antibody                titer following a 0,1,2-month immunization schedule was superior to the peak                following a 0,1,7-month immunization schedule [22]. When considering the CD4 T                cell response as reported here, no differences were detected between children who                received RTS,S/AS01E on a 0,1- or 0,1,2-month schedule, but the                0,1,7-month induced higher responses one month after the last vaccination. The                differences between the 0,1,2- and the 0,1,7-month schedules were no longer detected                at month 19. The physiological basis for better peak antibody responses with a                0,1,2- over a 0,1,7-month schedule, but opposite observation when considering CD4 T                cell responses, are unclear. Delaying the last immunization dose is classically                described as being favorable to immunogenicity in young children [34], as seen here                with CD4 T cell responses but not antibody responses. The clinical significance of                these observations remains unclear. Ongoing studies are evaluating respective                vaccine efficacy of a 0,1,2- and a 0,1,7-month RTS,S/AS01E infant                immunization schedule.
Altogether, the CMI data reported in this study combined with the anti-CSP antibody                responses in children described previously [15], [22], [32] support the ongoing Phase III                evaluation of protective efficacy and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS01E                administered using a three dose regimen.
