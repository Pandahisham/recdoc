PROTHROMBIN DEFICIENCY THE CAUSE OF BLEEDING IN BILE FISTULA DOGS

 The bleeding tendency that develops in bile fistula dogs, completely or partially deprived of bile, is due to a prothrombin deficiency of the blood plasma. However, a relatively low prothrombin level may exist in these animals without the occurrence of spontaneous hemorrhage. The prothrombin level may remain within the limits of normal if sufficient bile has been fed. In these cases no disturbance in blood clotting occurs.
