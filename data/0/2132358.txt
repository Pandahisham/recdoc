RIFT VALLEY FEVER IN MAN 

 A case of Rift Valley fever following an accidental laboratory infection, and believed to be the first instance of the disease in the Western hemisphere, is reported. Although the course of illness was otherwise quite typical, it was complicated by thrombophlebitisâ€”a condition not previously described in association with this disease in man. Death was caused by a pulmonary embolus.
