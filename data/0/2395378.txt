Patient. We describe a case of chondroblastoma of the os calcis which metastasized to the tibia, soft tissues and lung. A complete response of the lung lesions was noted with chemotherapy.
Discussion. Review of the published literature shows that metastatic chondroblastoma only arises following local recurrence of the tumour.
