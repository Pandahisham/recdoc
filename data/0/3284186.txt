The history of eponyms in obstetrics and gynecology is rich and long (1). Eponyms are here to stay (2,3).
Distinguishing whether the entry of Sonic the Hedgehog, the video game, cartoon, comic strip, and film character along with his great nemesis, Dr Ivo Robotnik, into the medical world is frivolous or dignified is largely a matter of personal taste, as well as is the use of other eponyms in medicine (4-6). However, analogies are a very important aspect in various areas of life and the use of analogies in medicine is no exception. Food-related medical analogies, like other analogies, assist with naming, learning, remembering, reasoning, and consequently practice (7). Despite their importance, medical literature only occasionally deals with food-related medical metaphors. The beauty of these culinary medical terms lies in the fact that their use is generally idiosyncratic, random, and inconsistent, and is influenced by time, place, and culture (2).
Presented is an admittedly cherry-picked list of fascinating food-related medical terms in obstetrics and gynecology to whet the appetite (Table 1). We are only human and deserve some comic relief (34,35). Food for thought.
Cherry-picked food-related medical metaphors in obstetrics and gynecology
Lemon sign. Axial sonographic image of the fetal head at the level of the biparietal diameter (A) shows inward concavity of both frontal bones (arrows) instead of the normally seen convexity. This gives the head the appearance of a lemon. Sagittal sonographic image of the fetus (B) shows a meningomyelocele (thick arrow) in the lumbar region.
