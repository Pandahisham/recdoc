ELECTRON MICROSCOPE STUDIES ON THE DEGRANULATION OF RABBIT PERITONEAL LEUKOCYTES DURING PHAGOCYTOSIS

 Electron microscopic observations have established the mechanisms underlying degranulation of neutrophils and eosinophils during phagocytosis. The content of the granules is released into the phagocytic vacuole when their membranes fuse with the membrane lining the vacuole. The discharge mechanism appears to be applicable to the various morphological types of granules seen in rabbit polymorphs. It has been proposed that the release of material to the outside of the cell or the discharge of material into intracellular vacuoles, events involving membrane fusion, be termed "exoplasmosis."
