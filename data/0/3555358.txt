Aim: The aim of this study was to report three cases of children who had papillary thyroid carcinoma with diffuse pulmonary metastases treated by radioiodine. Radioiodine cumulative activity and follow-up were discussed.
Materials and Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the data of patients with diffuse pulmonary metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma. Patients with a follow-up of over 4 years were reviewed.
Results: The three patients (two females/one male) were aged, respectively, 13, 14, and 8 years, when they were operated. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was classified pT3pN1bM1 in one case and pT4pN1bM1 in two. All of them had high initial Tg and an initial diffuse pulmonary uptake of radioiodine clearly visible behind the remnant thyroid uptake. Radioiodine therapy was stopped in two patients who had had a cumulative activity of 74 and 51 GBq, respectively. Hemogram and spirometry were always normal. The latest scans showed fairly diffuse pulmonary uptake and Tg was decreased (16 and 42 ng/ml, respectively). A third patient (8 years) had an activity of 25 GBq. The latest scan (March 2012) showed the persistence of diffuse pulmonary uptake; Tg was high (167 ng/ml, normal < 0.1). Unfortunately, the spirometry control showed a partial restrictive syndrome. Continuation of radioiodine therapy was then discussed.
Conclusion: Radioiodine is the treatment for pulmonary diffuse metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma. Stabilization of the disease can be achieved after a high cumulative activity. But when a restrictive pulmonary syndrome appeared in a child of 12 years, radioiodine therapy is discussed, but what is the alternative to radioiodine therapy in diffuse pulmonary metastases from papillary thyroid carcinoma in children?
