Toxicological Pathology in the Rat Placenta

 The placenta grows rapidly for a short period with high blood flow during pregnancy and          has multifaceted functions, such as its barrier function, nutritional transport, drug          metabolizing activity and endocrine action. Consequently, the placenta is a highly          susceptible target organ for drug- or chemical-induced adverse effects, and many          placenta-toxic agents have been reported. However, histopathological examination of the          placenta is not generally performed, and the placental toxicity index is only the          placental weight change in rat reproductive toxicity studies. The placental cells          originate from the trophectoderm of the embryo and the endometrium of the dam, proliferate          and differentiate into a variety of tissues with interaction each other according to the          development sequence, resulting in formation of a placenta. Therefore, drug- or          chemical-induced placental lesions show various histopathological features depending on          the toxicants and the exposure period, and the pathogenesis of placental toxicity is          complicated. Placental weight assessment appears not to be enough to evaluate placental          toxicity, and reproductive toxicity studies should pay more attention to histopathological          evaluation of placental tissue. The detailed histopathological approaches to investigation          of the pathogenesis of placental toxicity are considered to provide an important tool for          understanding the mechanism of teratogenicity and developmental toxicity with embryo          lethality, and could benefit reproductive toxicity studies.

The placenta grows rapidly and exhibits marked changes in morphological structure according        to fetal development. Although the placenta is a temporary organ, it is an interface between        the dam and developing embryos/ fetuses and a multifaceted organ that performs a number of        important functions that are modified throughout gestation. These functions include        anchoring the developing fetus to the uterine wall, mediating maternal immune tolerance,            O2/ CO2 exchange, providing nutrients for        the fetus and removing waste products during embryonic development1. It also secures the embryo/fetus to the endometrium as a        protective barrier against xenobiotics and releases a variety of steroids, hormones and        cytokines. Therefore, placental dysfunction and injury have adverse effects on the        maintenance of pregnancy, and fetal growth and development. Drug- or chemical-induced        histopathological changes of the placenta in rats are important in safety evaluation to        understand the mecha nism of teratogenicity and developmental toxicity. However, the        placenta has not received proper consideration as a target organ in safety evaluation of the        risks for dams and embryos/fetuses. Morphological or histopathological evaluation of        placental development and abnormalities has been scarce and incomplete in experimental        animals. The present review describes an overview of the normal placental structure and the        histopathology of some drug- or chemical-induced placental lesions and the relationship        between fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and a small placenta in rats.

The remaining fetal components include            three layers (trophoblast, basement membrane and fetal capillary), whereas the maternal            components are reduced step by step.

In mammals, a yolk sac placenta and chorioallantoic placenta, are present during gestation.        The yolk sac actively absorbs nutrients from the chorion and chorionic cavity, transports        them to the embryo through the yolk sac circulation, and plays a role as a transient        placenta during early post-implantation before the allantoic circulation is established2,3. In most mammals including humans, the yolk        sac placenta becomes vestigial after the first trimester. On the other hand, the inverted        yolk sac eventually covers the fetus and contributes to the special functions as a yolk sac        placenta before parturition in rodents and rabbits. The chorioallantoic placenta is the        principal placenta in mammals during middle to late-gestation and is formed from the        endometrium of the dam and the trophectoderm of the embryo. The definitive chorioallantoic        placenta shows a variety of different shapes between species4, such as diffuse (horse, pig), discoid (human, rodent), zonary        (dog, cat) and multicotyledonary (cow, sheep). Furthermore, the three main types are        recognized according to the relationship established between the chorion and uterine          wall5,6: (1) epitheliochorial type        (horse, pig, cow), (2) endotheliochorial type (dog, cat) and (3) hemochorial type (human,        rodent; Fig. 1).
 Structural components and differentiation of the rat placenta.
The rat chorioallantoic placenta morphologically has a discoid shape and is classified into        the hemochorial type. Histologically, the maternal part of the placenta consists of the        decidua and metrial gland. The fetal part of the placenta consists of the labyrinth zone and        basal zone (Fig. 2). In addition, there are two        distinct layers of membranes that enclose the fetus. The outer layer is the yolk sac, and        the inner layer is the amnion.

The trophectoderm, which differentiates into the placenta, consists of the mural          trophectoderm and polar trophectoderm (Fig. 2).          The mural trophectoderm surrounding the blastocyst cavity arrests cell division and          differentiates into primary trophoblastic giant cells just after implantation. The polar          trophectoderm neighboring the embryoblast forms the ectoplacental cone and invades into          the decidua (Figs. 3, 4). The edge and center of the ectoplacental cone differentiate          into (secondary) trophoblastic giant cells and spongiotrophoblasts, respectively, and then          these cell masses form the basal zone7.          The chorion, which is the embryonic-side membrane of the ectoplacental cone, fuses with          the allantois derived from the embryonic hindgut and then differentiates into the          labyrinth zone. In the endometrium, the decidual cells develop from the endometrial          stromal cells by stimulation of blastocyst apposition (decidualization) and form the basic          structural matrix of the decidua. The decidua          rapidlygrowsandfillsuptheuterinelumen,causinginflammation, edema, congestion, and          hemorrhages. The metrial gland is composed of nodular aggregates of heterogeneous tissue          that develops in the mesometrial triangle in the uterine wall. A schematic view of          placental development in rats and rabbits is shown in Fig. 58,9.
i) Labyrinth zone

 Time-dependent change in the thickness of each placental layer in the rat.
The labyrinth zone contains the maternal sinusoids and the trophoblastic septa, which            are composed of the trilaminar trophoblastic epithelium and fetal capillary (Fig. 6). The maternal sinusoids full of maternal            blood pass between the trophoblastic septa without an endothelium. The trophoblast            epithelium, which comes into direct contact with the maternal blood, is referred to as            the cytotrophoblast (Fig. 7). The            cytotrophoblast can be easily discerned by its large spherical nucleus with prominent            nucleolus. It displays numerous microvilli on its surface and contains many pinocytotic            vesicles at the basal position. Under this trophoblast layer, there are two layers of            syncytiotrophoblasts (syncytiotrophoblast I and syncytiotrophoblast II from the maternal            sinusoid side). Gap junctions are present between these two syncytiotrophoblast layers.            Basal laminas are located between the syncytiotrophoblast II layer and the fetal            capillary endothelium. The continuity of these syncytiotrophoblasts layers provides a            placental barrier10. The fetal            capillaries are the fenestrated type. The pores may contribute to the high permeability            of the fetal capillary11. Maternal and            fetal blood come very close together, and most of the maternofetal exchange of            substances is carried out in the labyrinth zone. The proliferative activity of these            trophoblasts peaks in midgestation and reduces gradually toward late gestation. The            labyrinth zone becomes a major part of the placenta with pregnancy progression, although            other parts of the placenta regress after midgestation (Figs. 5, 8).
ii) Basal zone (Junctional zone)
The basal zone is comprised of three differentiated cells: (1) spongiotrophoblast            cells, (2) trophoblastic giant cells and (3) glycogen cells (Figs. 2, 6). The            spongiotrophoblast cells are located immediately above the trophoblastic giant cell            layer and are the main structural component of the basal zone. The trophoblastic giant            cells located at the maternal-placental interface are one of the major endocrine cells            of the placenta. They synthesize and secrete hormones/ cytokines belonging to the            prolactin family12–14 Glycogen cells            have been reported to appear to be derived from the spongiotrophoblasts. However, recent            evidence may suggest that glycogen cells are distinct from spongiotrophoblasts15,16. Glycogen cells are transiently            detected in the basal zone in midgestation. They form multiple small cell masses and            glycogen cell islands, and most of them disappear at the end of pregnancy. Their            biological function is not well understood, but it appears to be related with glycogen            metabolism. The trophoblasts originated from the glycogen cells invade into the decidua            and metrial gland as interstitial invasion with an extensive mushroom-like spreading.            The basal zone forms channels draining the maternal blood from the placenta, but fetal            capillaries do not penetrate into the basal zone.
 i) Decidua
Decidual cells surrounding the blastocyst initially form the primary decidual zone,            which is avascular and densely packed with decidual cells. Subsequently, the more            loosely packed decidual cells around the primary decidual zone form the secondary            decidual zone17 (Fig. 3). The primary decidual zone degenerates progressively, and            placental and embryonic growth slowly replace the secondary decidual zone, which is            reduced to a thin layer called the decidua capsularis and decidua parietalis. The            mesometrial decidual cells ultimately form only a thin layer at the base of the placenta            called the decidua basalis, which is an important site for maternal angiogenesis. The            decidua basalis includes newly developed blood vessels, which play essential roles in            the development of vascularized decidual-placental interface18. The decidua can produce a wide range of hormones,            cytokines, growth factors and immunomodulatory            moleculesinvolvedintherecruitmentofthelimitedbutspecific immune cell populations and            growth of the placenta19,20. 
ii) Metrial gland
The metrial gland is a normal structure located in the mesometrial triangle of the            pregnant uterus from early gestation and is fully developed in midgestation, leading to            regression before parturition21. The            metrial gland is composed of a dynamic mixed cell population of decidualized endometrial            stromal cells, uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, spinal-shaped arteries and              fibroblasts22 (Fig. 6). UNK cells belong to a family of natural killer (NK)            cells. They are recruited after conception, rapidly divide and differentiate to a            phenotype that is different from that of the circulating NK cells in the metrial              gland23. UNK cells play an important            immunological role in their tolerogenic form24. In addition, two types of trophoblasts invade from the fetal            part into the metrial gland: endovascular trophoblasts and interstitial trophoblasts.            The former enter uterine blood vessels where they can replace endothelial cells, and            invade to the metrial gland from GDs 13–1425. The latter penetrate through the uterine stroma from GD 15 and            are often situated in perivascular locations26. The endovascular and interstitial trophoblast migrating into            the metrial gland express a subset of members of the prolactin gene family12. The invaded endovascular trophoblasts            and uNK cells are necessary for spinal-shaped arterial remodeling27,28.
i) Amnion
The amnion develops from the membrane that crosses between the exocoelom and amniotic            cavity. Turning of the embryo induces the amnion to become enlarged, and then the amnion            surrounds the whole embryo and forms the amniotic raphe after midline fusion29. The amnion consists of a single layer            of flattened ectodermal cells and some connective tissue. The amniotic fluid allows free            movement of the fetus during the later stages of pregnancy and protects it by            diminishing the risk of injury.
ii)Yolk sac
The yolk sac develops from the membrane lining the exocoelom, becomes enlarged and            surrounds the whole embryo like the amnion. It is divided into two parts: (1) the            visceral yolk sac surrounding the embryo with the amnion and (2) the parietal yolk sac            apposed to the chorion (Fig. 6). Because the            parietal yolk sac ruptures in midgestation, the inside of the visceral yolk sac becomes            exposed to the intrauterine cavity and is called a reversed yolk sac placenta. The yolk            sac consists of epithelial cells and mesodermal cells. In addition, the parietal yolk            sac is lined with Reichert’s membrane, which is a rodent-specific and acellular thin            membrane. Blood islands are formed on the surface of the yolk sac and subsequently            develop into the yolk sac circulation.
 Placental circulation in the rat.
The maternal circulation through the placenta is as follows (Fig. 9); the maternal arterial supply to the placenta originates          from radial arteries, which enter the uterus through the myometrium on the mesometrial          side of the uterus. Branches of the radial arteries either pass laterally through the          myometrium or traverse the myometrium and enter the metrial gland. Then these arteries          branch into several spinal-shaped arteries. After traversing the decidua basalis, the          spiral arteries converge to form a small number of centrally located arterial canals. The          arterial canals turn around at the surface and lead into the trophoblast-lined maternal          sinusoid spaces in the labyrinth zone. Maternal blood drains from the labyrinth through          venous sinuses that cross the basal zone into the decidua basalis. The venous sinuses          traverse the outer region of the metrial gland and exit into the radial veins outside the            myometrium18.
 Placental comparison between the rat and human.
Generally, rat placental models have been useful for evaluating the potential of drugs or          chemicals that affect human reproductive development, since there are several similarities          between rats and humans in early placental development30. However, there are some differences between rats and            humans31,32, such as the embryo/fetal          period ratio, implantation type, function of the yolk sac placenta, placental structure          and endocrine synthesis (Fig. 10). Particularly,          it is suggested that rat placental models are unsuitable for evaluating the potential          effects of drugs or chemicals on the human reproductive system and developmental toxicity          induced by the alteration of placental endocrine functions, because estrogen biosynthesis          during pregnancy in humans is much different from that in rats33. Thus, extrapolating data from rats to humans in drug- or          chemical-induced developmental toxicity should be done based on fully understanding the          differences and similarities between the rat and human placenta.
 Time-dependent change in placental and fetal weight in the rat.
The placenta grows rapidly for a short period with high blood flow during pregnancy            (Fig. 11) and has multifaceted functions, such          as its barrier function, nutritional transport, drug metabolizing activity and endocrine          action. Consequently, the placenta is a highly susceptible target organ for drug- or          chemical-induced adverse effects, and many placenta-toxic agents have been reported (Table 1). On the other hand, the dam and fetus          have a close relationship with each other via the placenta and form the          maternal-fetal-placental unit in mammalian embryonic development. Drug- or          chemical-induced placental functional depression and injury subsequently result in          abnormal fetal growth or devel-opment leading to fetal resorption or teratogenicity. Thus,          the placenta is an important organ for evaluating embryonic developmental toxicity and          understanding its mechanism34. However,          histopathological examination of the placenta is not generally performed, and the          placental toxicity index is only the placental weight change in rat reproductive toxicity          studies. As we note below, some drug- or chemical-induced placental histopathological          lesions have been described from the point of view of placental weight changes.
An increase in placental weight is macropathologically observed as placental            hypertrophy. Firstly, placental hypertrophy is induced as a compensatory reaction to            IUGR under the conditions of a slightly unfavorable maternal environment, such as            maternal hemorrhage35, uterine vessel              ligation36 and carbon monoxide              exposure37. In spontaneously            hypertensive rats, it is induced in response to a poor capacity of the uteroplacental            unit for transferring glucose to fetuses38. Drug- and chemical-induced compensatory placental hypertrophy            is reported in indomethacin-exposed rats39 and ethanol-exposed rats40,41. Secondly, placental hypertrophy is detected in the intact            uterus with a decreased number of corpora luteum, implantation sites and fetuses (less            than six fetuses in rats)42 as an            implantation-related reaction. Thirdly, placental hypertrophy is induced as a hormone            imbalance reaction, such as estrogen deficiency43,44 and ovariectomy with estrogen and progesterone              treatment45. Pathological sequential            changes of ketoconazoleinduced placental hypertrophy were recently investigated in              rats46, as described below.
 Placental hypertrophy (Rat, GD 21, left - control; right - ketoconazole).                Ketoconazole treatment.
 Thickening of the basal zone (Rat, GD 17, HE stain, left - control; right -                ketoconazole). Ketoconazole treatment. B, basal zone; DB, decidua basalis; GlyC,                glycogen cell; L, labyrinth zone; ST, spongiotrophoblast.
Ketoconazole, an imidazole antifungal compound, was orally administered at doses of 0            and 25 mg/kg/day during gestation days (GDs) 12 to 14, and placentas were sampled on GDs            15, 17 and 21. There were no effects on the fetal mortality rates at each sampling time.            No effects on fetal weight or no macroscopic fetal abnormalities were detected on GD 21.            The placentas in the ketoconazole-treated group appeared more hypertrophic with            increases in their weight, diameter and/or thickness from GD 15 onward (Fig. 12). Histopathologically, increased thickness            was noted in the labyrinth zone and basal zone on GDs 17 and 21, while the change was            already evident in the former zone on GD 15. In the labyrinth zone, the mitotic figures            of trophoblasts were elevated on GD 15. A multiple cystic dilatation of maternal            sinusoids was observed in some placentas on GDs 15, 17 and 21. In the basal zone, an            increase in the number of spongiotrophoblasts and clusters of glycogen cells were            detected on GDs 17 and 21. These changes were particularly remarkable at the edge of the            basal zone (Fig. 13). In the decidua, there            were no significant changes in either histology or thickness between the control and the            ketoconazole-treated group during GDs 15 to 21. Estrogen is a known inhibitor of            placental growth, and its deficiency induces placental hypertrophy43,44. Ketoconazole inhibits 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20lyase            and aromatase activity in the steroid biosynthesis pathway47,48. Administration of estrogen inhibits ketoconazole            induced-placental hypertrophy in rats49. In addition, overgrowth of the basal zone is detected in            pregnant rats ovariectomized and supplied with estrogen and progesterone45, and this may be induced as a response            to hormonal imbalance. Therefore, it is suggested that ketoconazole administration in            pregnant rats induces placental hypertrophy, which is attributed to the overgrowth of            the labyrinth zone and basal zone by inhibition of estrogen synthesis and hormonal            imbalance.
A decrease in placental weight is macropathologically observed as a small placenta.          Mitotic inhibition, apoptosis, degeneration and/or necrosis of trophoblasts, which are          induced by direct placental injury or nonspecific effects associated with the conditions          of an excessively unfavorable maternal environment, result in the inhibition of placental          development, leading to a small placenta.

Placental necrosis macroscopically shows thinning, discoloration, hemorrhage, white            spots or adherence of the yolk sac on the chorion surface (Fig. 14). In animal experiments, placental necrosis is induced by            such things as valproate acid50,              chlorpromazine51,              glucocorticoid52,              streptozotocin53, cadmium54, ethanol40, lead acetate55, diethylstilbestrol, estrogen, tobacco, adrenomedullin            antagonist, cocaine and vitamin E-deficiency. Histopathologically, placental necrosis            appears more commonly in the trophoblasts in the labyrinth zone. There is a reduction in            thickness and disruption of the trophoblastic septa and irregular dilatation of maternal            sinusoids with hemorrhage, fibrin deposition and inflammatory cell migration, leading to            fibrosisand calcification (Fig. 15). In the            cadmium-exposed placenta, expression of metallothionein is detected in the necrotic area            in the labyrinth zone (Fig. 16), although the            main expression site of metallothionein is in the decidua and yolk sac surrounding the            embryo/fetus throughout gestation56.

Among other specific changes, fetal sideroblastic anemia resulting from hemoglobin            synthesis inhibition can induce iron deposition not only in the erythroblasts, but also            in the trophoblastic septa (Fig. 17).

Cystic degeneration of glycogen cells is the condition describing abnormal retention of            extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation within glycogen cells. The vacuoles contain            eosinophilic fibrinous material and polymorphs. The degenerated cells undergo cytolysis            and subsequently coalesce into multiple large cysts that are filled with a homogeneous            acidophilic mass and multiple clusters of residual glycogen cells, macrophages,            erythrocytes and cell debris (Fig. 18). The            degenerated cells did not undergo regression, although most glycogen cells disappear at            the end of pregnancy in normal development. In animal experiments, cystic degeneration            of glycogen cells is induced by such things as chlorpromazine51, streptozotocin53, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)57 and TCDD58.
 Placental apoptosis can be detected in both endothelial cells, trophoblasts and            stromal cells of normal placental tissue, and is believed to be a part of normal            developmental placental aging59.            However, placental apoptosis is also increased in spontaneous abortion, preeclamptic            pregnancies, post-term pregnancies and pregnancies complicated with IUGR60–62. It is known that trophoblasts in            the fetal part of the placenta are a common toxicological target tissue for some drugs            and chemicals, because they have high proliferative activity and constitute a major            structural component of the fetal part of the placenta. Trophoblast apoptosis leads to a            lack of cell populations required for later normal histogenesis, resulting in a small            placenta. In animal experiments, placental apoptosis is induced by such things as              glucocorticoid52,63,              lipopolysaccharide64, T-2 Toxin65, anoxia and some anticancer drugs.            Particularly, anticancer drugs, such as ethylnitrosourea66 and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine67 induce trophoblastic apoptosis and/or mitotic            inhibition by an increase in p53 expression in response to DNA damage. However,            anticancer drug-induced histopathological lesions differ depending on the drugs and the            exposure period. The pathological sequential changes of the small placenta in rats            treated with busulfan68, 6-MP57 and cisplatin (not yet published) were            recently investigated, as described below.

 Left - apoptosis of trophoblasts in the labyrinth zone (Rat, GD 15, TUNEL stain).                Right - degeneration and necrosis of trophoblasts with deposition of calcium in the                labyrinth zone (Rat, GD 21, HE stain). Busulfan treatment.
Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is a known teratogen, inducing anophthalmia, microtia,            microrostellum, micrognathia, microabdomen, micromelia, oligodactylia, brachydactylia,            vestigial tail, short tail, anasarca, microencephaly, microphthalmia, and cataract in              rats69. In the present study,            busulfan was intraperitoneally administered at doses of 0 and 10 mg/kg/day during GDs 12            to 14, and placentas were sampled on GDs 13.5, 14.5, 15, 16 and 21. There were no            effects on the fetal mortality rates at each sampling time. Macroscopically, fetal            dwarfism was observed with reduced body weight and kinky tail in the busulfan-treated            group. The placentas decreased in weight and were shown macroscopically to be small and            thin with scattered white spots and a white peripheral rim on GD 21 (Fig. 19). Histopathologically, busulfan treatment            provoked increased apoptosis (Fig. 20) and            decreased mitotic activities of the trophoblasts in the labyrinth zone on GDs 13.5,            14.5, 15 and 16. Degeneration and necrosis of the trophoblasts, a diminution in            thickness of the trophoblastic septa with deposition of calcium and irregular dilation            of the maternal sinusoids were scattered in the labyrinth zone (Fig. 20), although there were no conspicuous changes in the basal            zone. A reduction in diameter in the labyrinth zone was detected on GD 21. From these            results, it is suggested that busulfan induces cell cycle arrest in the G1/G2-phase and            DNA damage in trophoblasts, leading to apoptosis and mitotic inhibition in the labyrinth            zone. It is reported that the proliferative period of spongiotrophoblasts in the basal            zone diminishes earlier and is narrower than that of trophoblasts in the labyrinth              zone70. Therefore, the difference in            sensitivity to busulfan between the labyrinth zone and the basal zone appears to be            attributed to the difference of each cellular proliferation period with advancing            pregnancy. It is considered that busulfan administration in pregnant rats induces growth            arrest of the labyrinth zone, leading to a small placenta.

The purine antimetabolite 6-MP is a known teratogen, inducing limb defects,            micrognathia, ventral hernia, skeletal, urogenital, CNS and ocular anomalies, cleft            palate and diaphragmatic hernia. In the present study, 6-MP was intraperitoneally            administered at doses of 0 and 60 mg/kg/day during GDs 11 to 12, and placentas were            sampled on GDs 13, 15 and 21. The fetal mortality rates increased up to 40%, and some            malformations of fetuses (as referred to above) were detected on GD 21 in the            6-MP-treated group. The fetal and placental weights were decreased on GDs 15 and 21.            Macroscopically, the placentas on GD 21 were small, brittle and thin with a white            peripheral rim (Fig. 21). Histopathologically,            6-MP treatment mainly evoked decreased mitosis on GDs 13 and 15, and increased apoptotic            cells on GDs 13, 15 and 21 in the labyrinth zone (Fig. 22). There were decreased trophoblasts, a diminution in the thickness of            the trophoblastic septa and irregular dilatation of maternal si nuses with deposition of            fibrin on GD 21 (Fig. 22). In the basal zone,            there were decreased mitotic spongiotrophoblasts on GD 13 and increased apoptotic cells            on GD 21. PAS-positive material in the spongiotrophoblasts on GD 15 was still detected            in the 6-MP-treated group, but not in the control group (Fig. 23). The clusters of glycogen cells consisted of small and            irregular-shaped cells as compared with the controls. Because most of the PAS-positive            material in the spongiotrophoblasts disappears after GD 14 in normal development8, spongiotrophoblast development and            differentiation appear to be delayed in the 6-MP-treated group. Furthermore, cytolysis            of glycogen cells (cystic degeneration of glycogen cells), apoptosis and a subinvolution            of spongiotrophoblasts were observed on GD 21 (Fig.              18). The thickness of the basal zone was increased on GD 21, as a result of the            cystic degeneration of glycogen cells, although the labyrinth zone was reduced in            diameter on GDs 15 and 21. Therefore, it is considered that 6-MP administration in            pregnant rats induces growth arrest of the labyrinth zone, leading to a small placenta.            In addition, 6-MP provokes a delay in the developmental process of the basal zone and            cystic degeneration of glycogen cells.
Cisplatin, a platinating agent, is considered to be highly embryo lethal and growth            retardant but to not be a teratogen in rats and rabbits71. Cisplatin can pass through the placental barrier and is a            transplacental carcinogen for the fetal liver, kidney, nervous system and lung in            pregnant rats72. In the present study,            cisplatin was intraperitoneally administered at 2 mg/kg/day during GDs 11 to 12            (GD11,12-treated group) or GDs 13 to 14 (GD13,14-treated group), and the placentas were            sampled on GDs 13, 15, 17 and 21. Fetal mortality rates were increased up to 65% from GD            17 onward, and fetal weights were decreased on GD 21 in the GD11,12-treated group.            However, there were no effects on fetal mortality rates and fetal weight in the            GD13,14-treated group. There were no macroscopic fetal abnormalities on GD 21 in either            treated groups. A reduction in placental weight was detected from GD 15 onward, and the            placentas on GD 21 were macroscopically small and thin with a white peripheral rim in            both treated groups. Histopathologically, an increase in apoptotic cells was detected in            the labyrinth zone during the experimental period and in the basal zone on GD 21, and            then labyrinth zone hypoplasia was induced in the GD13,14-treated group. By contrast, an            increase in apoptotic cells was detected on GDs 13, 15 and 17 in the labyrinth zone, and            during the experimental period in the basal zone (Fig. 24), and then hypoplasia of the labyrinth and basal zones was induced in            the GD11,12-treated group (Fig. 25). In            addition, a marked decrease in glycogen cell islands in the basal zone was also detected            on GDs 15 and 17 in this group (Fig. 26).            There was a reduction in interstitial invasion of glycogen cell-like trophoblasts along            the arterial canal into the metrial gland on GD 15 (Fig. 26) and metrial gland hypoplasia from GD 17 onward (Fig. 27). Consequently, trophoblastic apoptosis in the basal            zone, including pre-glycogen cells leads to a lack of the cell populations required for            normal development into glycogen cells and then inhibits the interstitial invasion of            glycogen cells into the decidua and metrial gland, resulting in metrial gland            hypoplasia. On the other hand, in the 6-MP-administrated rats on GDs 11 and 12, there            was no detected basal zone hypoplasia, although labyrinth zone hypoplasia was              induced57. These results suggest            that the basal zone has not only an earlier and narrower sensitive period but also            higher specificity for the toxicity of anticancer drugs, compared with the labyrinth            zone. Therefore, it is considered that cisplatin administration in pregnant rats induces            trophoblast apoptosis in the labyrinth and basal zones, leading to a small placenta. In            addition, metrial gland hypoplasia occurs secondary to the failure of glycogen cell            island development.
Hypoplasia of the decidua and metrial gland is not reflected in the placental weight,            because placentas are stripped off between the basal zone and the decidua basalis at the            time of placental weight measurement in developmental toxicity studies. Hypoplasia of            the decidua and metrial gland is induced by such things as decidualization inhibition,            reduction in the proliferative activity of uNK cells and inhibition of interstitial            trophoblast invasion into the metrial gland. In animal experiments, hypoplasia of the            decidua and metrial gland is induced as a result of inhibition of matrix            metalloproteinases by doxycycline73,            suppression of decidual cell proliferation by benzimidazole fungicides74, hydroxyurea75, diethylstilbestrol, mitomycin and ovariectomy76, decreased progesterone levels            resulting from by tributyltin77 and            inhibition of interstitial trophoblast invasion by cisplatin (described above). The            pathological sequential changes in tamoxifen-induced metrial gland hypoplasia78 were recently investigated in rats, as            described below.
 Marked metrial gland hypoplasia with less well development of spiral arteries                (Rat, GD 11, HE stain, left - control; right - tamoxifen). Tamoxifen treatment. DB,                decidua basalis; MG, metrial gland.
 Decrease in uNK cells with clear cytoplasm and PAS-positive granules around spiral                arteries (Rat, GD 13, PAS stain, left - control; right - tamoxifen). Tamoxifen                treatment. SA, spiral artery.
Tamoxifen, a nonsteroid selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been widely used for            therapy of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. In the present study, tamoxifen was            intraperitoneally administered at doses of 0 and 2 mg/ kg/day during GDs 8 to 10, and            placentas were sampled on GDs 11, 13, 15, 17 and 21. The fetal mortality rates in the            tamoxifen-treated group were increased up to approximately 50% from GD 15 onward.            However, there were no effects on the weights of live embryos/fetuses and their            placentas at each sampling time, and there were no macroscopic abnormalities in the            fetuses and placentas on GD 21. Histopathologically, the size of the metrial gland in            the tamoxifentreated group was reduced at all sampling times compared with the control            group (Fig. 28). The spiral arteries appeared            less well developed in the hypoplastic metrial gland (Fig. 28). The uNK cells around the spiral arteries were decreased from GD 13            onward in the tamoxifen-treated group (Fig.            29). The number of mitotic cells that appeared to be uNK cells was lower on GDs            11 and 13 in the tamoxifen-treated group. There were no obvious changes in the labyrinth            zone, basal zone or decidua basalis. It is known that the development of the metrial            gland is a part of decidualization, which is a sequential process of growth and            differentiation of uterine stromal cells and uNK cells, and remodeling of the            extracellular matrix and maternal vasculature79. In NK gene knock-out mice (TgE26 mice), there was no            development of the mesometrial triangle area into the metrial gland, and the            reproductive performance was very poor (mortality: 40%), suggesting that uNK cells are            necessary for placental growth and gestational success80. The uNK cells are involved in a role of regulation and            restructuring of spiral arteries in the metrial gland23,81, and maternal immune tolerance forms toward invading            trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface24,27. Alterations of uNK cell function and inadequate remodeling            of spiral arteries play an important role in preeclampsia, which leads to high maternal            blood pressure, elevated concentrations of urinary protein and poor fetal growth82. Therefore, it is suggested that the            antiestrogen effect of tamoxifen inhibits the proliferation of decidualized endometrial            stromal cells in the metrial gland and leads to metrial gland hypoplasia resulting from            inhibition of proliferative activity of uNK cells and defective development of spiral            arteries. Tamoxifen-induced embryo/ fetus-toxicity might be associated with the immune            toler ance deficiency caused by decreased uNK cells in metrial gland hypoplasia and/or            preeclampsia caused by defective development of spiral arteries.
 Vacuolar degeneration of the yolk sac epithelium (Rat, GD 15, HE stain). Trypan                blue treatment.
Vacuolar degeneration of the yolk sac epithelium is induced and caused by the            accumulation of indigestible material in the vacuolar system by inhibition of            intralysosomal proteolysis83.            Histopathologically, the visceral yolk sac epithelium contains numerous accumulated            vacuoles (Fig. 30). In animal experiments, the            vacuolar degeneration of the yolk sac epithelium is induced by such things as trypan              blue83, Triton WR-133984, polyvinylpyrrolidone84, dextran84, sucrose84,              leupeptin85, somatomedin              inhibitor86, ethanol87 and dinitrophenol88. Before the formation of the chorioallantoic placenta,            the yolk sac plays a role in the uptake and transport of nutrients from the dam to the            developing embryo2,3. Particularly, in            the rodent, the functions of the yolk sac placenta are maintained until just before            parturition. Thus, yolk sac epithelial damage is correlated with embryonic malformations            and fetal developmental toxicity.
Placenta size, architecture, developmental and pathological processes, and metabolic        interaction with the fetus cooperate with placental transport and metabolic mechanisms to        qualitatively and quantitatively affect placental-fetal nutrient exchange89. In humans, a positive correlation between        placental weight and birth weight is observed in normal and large-for-gestational-age          infants90. Thus, it is commonly believed        that placental size and fetal weight are directly interrelated91. However, it has not been clear how the changes in        placental size and function relate to changes in fetal metabolic demands92. The effect of placental size on IUGR was        recently investigated in the placentas of rats exposed to 6-MP at various points of          gestation93, as described below.
 Increased in expression of GLUT3 (↑) along trophoblastic septa (Rat, GD 17, GLUT3            immunostain, left - control; right - 6MP). Treatment with 6MP.
In the present study, 6-MP was administered orally at 0 and 60 mg/kg/day on GD 9, 11, 13 or        15, and the placentas were sampled on GDs 17 and 21. The main pathological findings in all        treated groups were fetal resorption and IUGR with or without some malformations and a small        placenta caused by mitotic inhibition and apoptosis of trophoblasts in the labyrinth zone.        Complete fetal resorption was observed in most litters with the treatment on GD 9. The most        remarkable response of small placenta and fetal abnormalities to 6-MP treatment occurred in        the litters with the treatment on GD 11. However, the litters in a quarter of the dams with        the treatment on GD 11 showed no fetotoxicity despite a 25% decline in placental weight and        an increased fetal–placental weight ratio. Histopathologically, the expression of glucose        transporter GLUT3 was increased in the trophoblastic septa in all treated groups, and this        was particularly remarkable considering the proliferation of trophoblasts in the above        litters, which showed an increased fetal-placental weight ratio (Fig. 31). It is known that one of the major nutrient transport        functions of the placenta is to ensure adequate transfer of glucose from the maternal to        fetal circulation. Glucose transfer across the placental barrier is crucial for fetal        development. A common characteristic of pregnancies with IUGR is relative fetal        hypoglycemia, and a small placenta per se is the major limitation on        placental glucose transfer from the dam to the fetus94. Placental functions are highly adaptable and can change in        response either to the maternal environment or to defects within the placenta itself,        indicating either the capacity for placental nutrient transport to increase or the capacity        for the fetus to extract nutrients from the umbilical circulation95,96. From these results, it is suggested that the elevated        GLUT3 expression may reflect an attempt to increase the maternal-to-fetal glucose transport        supply in order to compensate for the deterioration of placental function in the        6-MP-exposed small placenta and contribute to normal fetal growth and development.        Therefore, it is considered that normal fetal growth and development can be maintained as a        result of an increase in the expression of glucose transporter as adaptive change, even if        the placental weight decreases by approximately 25% in 6-MP exposed rats.
The fully formed placenta plays a major role in the maintenance of nutrition for the fetus        and in the secretory and essential regulatory functions for the maintenance of pregnancy        during the fetal period. However, despite the placenta being one of the important organs for        evaluation of risks for the dam and embryo, the placental toxicity index in developmental        toxicity studies is the placental weight change alone. As previously described, the        pathogenesis of placental lesions show various and complex features, because the        constitutive cells of the placenta originate from embryonic and maternal tissue, proliferate        rapidly, differentiate and undergo morphological changes in close relation to each other        according to the development sequence in a short pregnancy period. Even if the placental        weight is reduced, the induced lesions are histopathologically different depending on the        toxicants and the exposure period. In addition, normal fetal growth and development can be        maintained as a result of the adaptive change, as long as the placental growth inhibition is        within the allowable range. It is difficult to detect pathological changes in the decidua        and metrial gland by placental weight assessment. Thus, placental weight assessment appears        not to be enough to evaluate placental toxicity, and reproductive toxicity studies should        pay more attention to placental histopathological evaluation on a case-by-case basis.        Moreover, placental histopathological evaluation should comprehensively reveal the        time-dependent changes in each placental tissue in view of the drug or chemical-exposure        period and normal placental development. These detailed histopathological approaches to the        pathogenesis of placental toxicity are considered to provide an important tool for        understanding the mechanism of teratogenicity and developmental toxicity with particular        regard to embryo lethality and delayed development, and could benefit reproductive toxicity        studies.
