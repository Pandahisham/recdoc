Vision After Early-Onset Lesions of the Occipital Cortex:I. Neuropsychological and Psychophysical Studies

We analyzed the visual functions of twopatients (MS, FJ) with bilateral lesion of theprimary visual cortex, which occurred at gestationalage 33 wk in MS and at postnatal month 7in FJ. In both patients basic visual functions—visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color, form,motion perception—are similarly preserved ormodestly impaired. Functions requiring highervisual processing, particularly figure-groundsegregation based on textural cues, are severelyimpaired. In MS, studied longitudinally, thedeficits attenuated between the ages of 4.5 and 8y, suggesting that the developing visual systemcan display a considerable degree of adaptiveplasticity several years after the occurrence of alesion. In FJ (age 18:9 to 20:6 y), who is moreimpaired, the recovery, if any, was less.
