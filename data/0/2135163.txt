A METHOD TO DETERMINE THE PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE MOUSE

 Advantage has been taken of the relative transparency of the claw of the mouse to devise a method, here described, to measure the blood pressure in the animal's leg. Direct measurements of the systolic blood pressure from the carotid arteries of anesthetized mice have also been made. Simultaneous blood pressure readings by both these methods applied to the same animal showed close agreement. The systolic pressure ranged from 60 to 126 mm. Hg, according to the conditions.
