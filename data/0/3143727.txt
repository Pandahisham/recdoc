The effect of an arm sling on energy consumption while walking in                    hemiplegic patients: a randomized comparison

Objective: To evaluate the effect of an arm sling on gait speed and                    energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia.
Design: A randomized crossover design.
Setting: A rehabilitation department of a university hospital.
Subjects: Thirty-seven outpatients with hemiplegia were included in                    this study.
Interventions: All patients walked on a 20-m walkway twice on the                    same day, randomly with and without an arm sling, at a self selected speed.
Main measures: The heart rate, gait speed, oxygen cost and oxygen                    rate were measured on all patients. We analysed all values with and without an                    arm sling and also compared them after all patients being stratified according                    to demographic and clinical characteristics.
Results: When we compared the heart rate between walking with                    (90.7 ± 17.2 beats/min) and without                    (91.2 ± 18.6 beats/min) the arm sling, it was                    significantly decreased while walking with the arm sling. When we compared the                    gait speed between walking with (32.8 m/min) and without                    (30.1 m/min), it was significantly increased with the arm sling walking.                    The O2 rate in hemiplegic patients walking with the arm sling was                    significantly decreased by 7%, compared to walking without arm sling                    (5.8 mL/kg min and 6.2 mL/kg min, respectively). The                        O2 cost in hemiplegic patients walking without arm sling was                    significantly 1.4 times greater than walking with it (0.2 mL/kg m and                    0.3 mL/kg m, respectively).
Conclusion: An arm sling can be used to improve the gait                    efficiency.

In patients with hemiplegia, gait problems such as poor gait performance, reduced                walking endurance and decreased functional mobility are some of the more serious                        disabilities.1,2                Some authors also reported that at a given speed, hemiplegic patients spend more                energy per unit of distance travelled than healthy individuals do.3,4 In addition, Bohannon et                    al.5 reported that most stroke patients rank the restoration of                walking in the community as one of the most important goals of rehabilitation.
Hemiplegic shoulder pain is also common after a stroke. It adversely affects the                recovery of arm function and independence in the activities of daily                        living.6 Although the relationship between subluxation and hemiplegic                shoulder pain remains unclear, various techniques are commonly used to correct this                subluxation, including slings7,8                and neuromuscular electric stimulation.9 Arm slings have various                purposes, including realigning scapular symmetry, supporting the forearm in a flexed                arm position, improving anatomic alignment with an auxiliary support and supporting                the shoulder with a cuff. Despite some uncertainty about their efficacy and timing                of use, arm slings are still the most preferred treatment modality for shoulder                subluxation in patients with hemiplegia with stroke.10
To our knowledge, there has been only one report about the effect of arm sling on                gait of hemiplegic patients. Yavuzer and Ergin11 reported that an arm sling                improved gait pattern using kinematic and kinetic parameters, especially during gait                training sessions of patients with hemiplegia who have impaired body image and                excessive motion of the centre of gravity. However, no study on the impact of arm                sling on energy efficiency in hemiplegia has yet been reported. On the basis of                previous study, it is hypothesized that shoulder support by an arm sling improves                not only gait pattern but also the energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia.                This study was designed to investigate the effect of shoulder support by an arm                sling on gait speed and energy efficiency of patients with hemiplegia.
Enrolled subjects were 47 consecutive outpatients with hemiparesis caused by stroke.                Inclusion criteria for hemiparetic patients were (a) first cerebrovascular accident                verified by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, (b) ability to                understand and follow commands, (c) ambulatory before stroke, (d) no medical                contraindication to walking, (e) ability to walk independently and (f) below the                fourth stage of Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery for the upper extremity.                Subjects were excluded if they had visual impairment, premorbid or comorbid                neurologic problems other than stroke, or were currently receiving medications known                to affect balance or gait, or refused the participation of present study. After                exclusion, registered subjects were 37 hemiparetic patients (25 men, 12 women), with                an average age of 61.3 years, an average height of 163.1 cm, and an average                weight of 60.6 kg.
All hemiparetic patients wore a vest-type shoulder forearm support (Kang’s                multi-support sling, Jeonglib O&P, Korea) during the gait trials. The vest-type                shoulder forearm support was designed and turned out to prevent glenohumeral                subluxation and stabilize the shoulder joint more effectively than a Bobath sling or                single strap.12
The study was done according to the 1983 revision of the 1975 Declaration of                Helsinki. It was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hanyang University                Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before data                collection.
All subjects were assessed by a single rater for shoulder pain, shoulder subluxation,                spasticity and motor recovery in the hemiparetic upper extremity. Shoulder pain was                assessed by questioning the subject about whether or not pain was. Diagnosis of                glenohumeral subluxation was based on the palpation method.13 Evaluation of                spasticity in the upper extremity was based on the modified Ashworth                        Scale.14 In addition, upper extremity motor skills were evaluated by                using the Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery for the upper extremity.15
All the patients walked on a 20-m walkway twice on the same day, randomly with and                without an arm sling, at a self-selected speed. Patients were allocated by a                computer-generated random sequence provided by a researcher not involved with                enrolment. Subjects assigned odd numbers walked with the arm sling first and those                with even numbers walked without the arm sling first. After the first walk, patients                rested for over 20 minutes; when the rater confirmed that the postwalking                heart rate difference from prewalking was less than 5 beats/min, patients started                the second walk with the same method. A crossover design was used because a blinded                protocol was impractical (Figure                    1). Figure                        1Flowchart of the study.

To assess the oxygen cost (O2 cost), the patients walked 20 m on                level ground at a self-selected comfortable speed. The required time was measured                with a stopwatch. Thereafter, we calculated gait speed by dividing 20 m by                measured time, and assessed the oxygen rate (O2 rate) with a Metamax 3B                (Cortex, Germany) portable analyser. The heart rate was monitored before and after                walking using a Polar A1 monitor (Polar electro, Finland). The reliability and                validity of the tools used in the present study had been reported                        previously.16–18
Data analysis was performed by using SPSS for Windows, version 11.0. Comparisons of                heart rate, gait speed, O2 rate and O2 cost with and without                the arm sling were performed by using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.                After all patients had been stratified according to their demographic and clinical                characteristics, we also compared the same parameters using the non-parametric                Mann–Whitney U-test.
Demographic and clinical findings for our patients are shown in Table 1. Heart rate, gait                speed, O2 rate and O2 cost of hemiplegic patients walking with                and without the arm sling are given in Table 2.

The mean and standard deviation of resting heart beat of all patients was 71.3 and                12.5 beats/min. When we compared the heart rate between walking with                (90.7 ± 17.2 beats/min) and without                (91.2 ± 18.6 beats/min) the arm sling, it was significantly                reduced while walking with the arm sling. When we compared the gait speed between                walking with (32.8 m/min) and without (30.1 m/min) the arm sling, it                was significantly increased with the arm sling. The mean and standard deviation of                resting O2 rate of all patients was 2.9 and 0.8 mL/kg min. The                    O2 rate in hemiplegic patients with the arm sling was significantly                reduced by 7%, compared to walking without the arm sling (5.8 mL/kg                min and 6.2 mL/kg min, respectively). The O2 cost in hemiplegic                patients walking without the arm sling was 1.5 times greater than walking with it                (0.2 mL/kg m and 0.3 mL/kg m, respectively).
When patients were stratified according to their demographic and clinical                characteristics, such as gender, type of stroke, hemiparetic side, spasticity, motor                skill, onset duration, shoulder pain and subluxation, there were no significant                differences of heart rate, gait speed, O2 rate and O2                cost.
Human locomotion involves smooth advancement of the body through space with the least                mechanical and physiological energy expenditure,19 but the gait of hemiplegic                patients with stroke is characterized by asymmetry in stride times and stride                length, slow velocity, poor joint and posture control, muscle weakness, abnormal                muscle tone and abnormal muscle activation patterns, mostly affecting the paretic                        side.20 Persistent gait deviation increases energy                        expenditure21 and can lead to pain and joint damage.22 In addition,                in hemiplegic patients, it was reported that the energy expenditure was increased                during performance of activities of daily living (ADL) due to the impairment of                cardiopulmonary functions, therefore, the cardiovascular loading was also                        increased.23
Given the above background, we speculated that minimization of unnecessary energy                expenditure and cardiovascular loading during gait would be important for gait                rehabilitation in patients with stroke. Although there has been controversy on the                efficiency of an arm sling for treatment of shoulder subluxation or pain, it was                reported that an arm sling improved gait pattern.11 Therefore, we conducted this                study and, to our knowledge, it is the first to report the beneficial effect of an                arm sling on the direct energy expenditure in hemiplegic patient while walking.
The measurement of heart rate has been reported to be useful in large studies                including the elderly, hemiplegic and cardiovascular patients because it is simple                to perform.24                In the present study, although mean heart rate was significantly decreased as                compared with baseline following the application of an arm sling, it seemed not to                be of clinical importance as the difference was too small. However, this tendency                implies that the application of an arm sling may reduce the cardiovascular loading                during gait in patients with hemiplegia, which also suggests that an arm sling could                be an effective tool for gait training in patients with hemiplegia.
Gait speed has a crucial effect on independence in patients with hemiplegia and may                vary depending on the authors, but has mostly been reported to be                        25–40 m/min.25,26 Robinett and                    Vondron27 reported that gait speed enabling independent ADL in                healthy people averaged 44.5 m/min. With regard to arm slings, Yavuzer and                        Ergin11 reported that the gait speed and stance period of the paretic                side increased, double support time of the paretic side decreased, excursion of the                centre of gravity decreased and weight bearing of the paretic side increased in                hemiplegic patients while using the arm sling.
In the present study, hemiplegic patients without an arm sling walked on an even                level at their comfortable gait speed; the gait speed of this level                (30.1 m/min, 1.81 km/h) is similar to slow speed walking                (2 km/h) in the previous study.28 Although the gait speed                following the application of an arm sling was also within slow speed walking level                (32.7 m/min, 1.96 km/h), it increased significantly compared with                the non-application group. In stroke patients, gait rehabilitation, including                increase of gait speed, is essential for the performance of independent ADL.                Therefore, the result of the present study suggests that an arm sling may be a                useful modalities in gait rehabilitation.
Most of the studies on the effect of supplemental aids on oxygen consumption and                energy expenditure have been conducted with a main focus on the lower extremities.                Study of the effect of supplemental aids for upper extremities on oxygen consumption                and energy expenditure is rare. Hanada and Kerrigan29 reported that arm                immobilization did not increase energy expenditure during level walking at a                comfortable gait speed in a healthy person. On the other hand, Kim et                    al.28 reported that arm restriction while walking resulted in                significant changes in energy consumption. Oxygen rate with arm restriction was                significantly increased during fast walking (6 km/h), but the oxygen                consumption rate with arm restriction was not changed while walking at a comfortable                speed (4 km/h) and was significantly decreased during slow speed walking                (2 km/h). Although subjects were healthy people and arm restriction rather                than shoulder support using an arm sling was attempted, these findings were in                agreement with the results of the present study that O2 rate and                    O2 cost decreased following the application of an arm sling. Because                oxygen consumption has been an indicator for measuring the work efficiency and has                shown consistent values with no respect to the age, sex and exercise                        proficiency,30 the results of the present study suggest that gait                efficiency was significantly improved following the application of an arm sling.
In our clinic, arm slings – usually Kang’s Multi-support –                are given to patients with hemiplegia during the flaccid period of the paretic upper                extremity. Lee et al.31 reported that Kang’s                Multi-support was helpful in reducing weight asymmetry compared with no sling or a                cuff-type sling and that it improved the standing balance of hemiplegic patients                because it contacts the patient’s body surface more than a cuff-type sling                or no sling. Therefore, we have applied Kang’s Multi-support to hemiplegic                patients with stroke to support paretic arm. Because hemiplegic patients with an                impaired body image are unaware of the location of their body weight line and they                do not have any sense of instability, they fail to make any postural adjustments so                the arm sling may serve as a feedback tool and remind the patient’s arm to                help postural adjustments. It may also help hemiparetic patients with attention                deficit or neglect pay more attention and position the paretic arm                        correctly.11,32
Many therapists do not want hemiparetic patients to use walking aids such as canes or                arm slings during daily life because they interfere with functional activities and                enhance the flexor synergy of the upper extremity.11,32 However, like the previous                study by Yavuzer and Ergin, the results of the present study suggest that                application of an arm sling affects the gait efficiency in hemiplegic patients                positively.
The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the sample size was relatively                small. Therefore, the results of present study may not be clinically relevant                although they seemed to be a statistically significant. Second, because the present                study was conducted for short period, generalization of these results was                inconclusive unless further studies on long-term effect of arm sling on hemiplegic                gait are performed. However, the present study does use clinical results to suggest                that hemiplegic arm support with an arm sling results in improvement of gait in                hemiplegic patients. In addition, the present study also provides objective data on                arm slings which have been controversial over their usefulness in hemiplegic                patients. To clarify the effectiveness of an arm sling for hemiplegic patients,                further study considering these limitations is needed.
