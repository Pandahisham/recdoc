Trichoscopy (hair and scalp dermoscopy) allows identification of hair and scalp diseases based on analysis of trichoscopy structures and patterns. Structures which may be visualized by trichoscopy include hair shafts, hair follicle openings, the perifollicular epidermis and cutaneous microvasculature. Trichoscopy allows distinguishing between normal terminal hairs and vellus (or vellus-like) hairs, which by definition are 0.03 mm or less in thickness and less than 3 mm in length. The method enables visualization of micro-exclamation hairs (in alopecia areata) or comma hairs (in tinea capitis) and hair shaft structure abnormalities, including genetic hair dystrophies, such as monilethrix, trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa. The number of hairs in one pilosebaceous unit may be assessed. In healthy individuals the usual number of hair per one pilosebacous unit is 2. Three to four hairs per unit are observed occasionally. A lower number of hairs is characteristic for hair loss (i.e. telogen effluvium, androgenic alopecia), an abnormally high number is characteristic for tufted folliculitis. In trichoscopy it may be distinguished whether hair follicles are normal, empty, fibrotic (“white dots”) filled with hyperkeratotic plugs (“yellow dots”) or containing hair fragments (“black dots). Red dots (in discoid lupus erythematosus) and dirty dots (in healthy children playing in the ground) were recently described. Analysis of perifollicular epidermis and blood vessels may provide additional information allowing trichoscopy diagnosis of most common hair and scalp diseases.
