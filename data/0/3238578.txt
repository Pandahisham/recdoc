Scheelite-type sodium neodymium(III) ortho-oxidomolybdate(VI), NaNd[MoO4]2            

Scheelite-type NaNd[MoO4]2 contains one crystallographic position (site symmetry ) for the large cations, which is mixed-occupied by Na+ and Nd3+ cations in a 1:1 molar ratio. Thus, both are surrounded by eight O atoms in the shape of a trigonal dodeca­hedron. Furthermore, the structure consists of crystallographically unique [MoO4]2− units (site symmetry ) surrounded by eight sodium and neodymium cations, which are all vertex-attached. The polyhedra around the Na+/Nd3+ cations are connected to four others via common edges, building up a three-dimensional network in whose tetra­hedral voids of O atoms the Mo6+ cations reside.

For isotypic NaLn[MoO4]2 structures, see: Stevens et al. (1991 ▶) and Teller (1992 ▶) for Ln = La; Teller (1992 ▶) for Ln = Ce; Zhao et al. (2010 ▶) for Ln = Er. For inter­penetrating diamond-like networks, see: Schustereit et al. (2011 ▶). These were also obseverd in NaTl, see: Zintl & Dullenkopf (1932 ▶).
