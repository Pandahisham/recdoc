The prevalence and types of coronary artery anomalies in Northern Ireland.

Coronary artery anomalies are uncommon, with a reported prevalence ranging from 0.2% to 1.6%. It is important that those who undertake coronary angiographic procedures are aware of the spectrum of these anomalies. Interventional percutaneous coronary revascularisation procedures are widely used in the management of patients with symptomatic coronary atherosclerosis. The presence of a coronary artery anomaly may make these procedures technically challenging. We have reviewed the Cardiac catheterisation database at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, and report the prevalence and types of these anomalies.
