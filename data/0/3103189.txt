8-Azatetracyclines: Synthesis and Evaluation of a Novel Class of Tetracycline Antibacterial Agents


A novel series of fully synthetic 8-azatetracyclines was prepared and evaluated for antibacterial activity. Compounds were identified that overcome both efflux (tet(K)) and ribosomal protection (tet(M)) tetracycline resistance mechanisms and are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Two compounds were identified that exhibit comparable efficacy to marketed tetracyclines in in vivo models of bacterial infection.

The tetracycline class of antibacterial agents has seen widespread clinical use for over 50 years due to its broad spectrum antibacterial activity.(1) Tetracyclines inhibit bacterial growth by preventing protein biosynthesis through binding to the 30S ribosome, thereby blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site.(2) This class includes a number of naturally occurring compounds, such as chlorotetracycline (1)(3) and tetracycline (2),(4) as well as several semisynthetic analogues, such as doxycycline (3)(5) and minocycline (4) (Figure 1).(6) In addition to their use as antibiotics for serious infections, tetracyclines have also been prescribed for use in acne and rosacea.(7) As with many classes of antibiotics, widespread use of tetracyclines has led to resistance and has limited their use in more complicated bacterial infections.8,9
Examples of naturally occurring (1 and 2) and semisynthetic (3−6) tetracyclines.
Two major bacterial resistance mechanisms have been identified for tetracyclines: (1) active transport from bacterial cells via efflux pumps(10) and (2) ribosomal protection.(11) The efflux pumps are comprised of inner membrane tetracycline efflux proteins that were first identified in Gram-negative organisms (tet(A−E))10a,10b and were later found in Gram-positive bacteria (tet(K−L)).(10c) The ribosomal protection mechanism (tet(M−O)) involves the expression of proteins that bind to the ribosome and allow protein synthesis to proceed even in the presence of tetracyclines. The exact mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. Since these early discoveries, the number of efflux and ribosomal protection mechanisms identified has increased.(12)
The presence of the strongly activating 10-hydroxy group readily enables chemical modification of the tetracycline D-ring at the 7- and 9-positions. This strategy led to the introduction of the 7-dimethylamino group in compounds 4−6, all of which have demonstrated improved activity in bacterial strains bearing efflux pump resistance mechanisms. More recently, the 9-substituted glycylcyclines, such as tigecycline (5),(13) and the aminomethylcyclines, such as amadacycline (6),(14) have shown improved activity for resistant organisms bearing the ribosomal protection mechanism.
In 2005, Myers and co-workers published a fully synthetic route to the tetracyclines, the key step of which involves the Michael−Dieckmann condensation of the AB precursor 8 with structurally diverse D-ring precursors.15,16 This route provides potential access to a broad range of tetracyclines that are inaccessible via traditional semisynthesis.(17) One example of this is the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the D-ring, resulting in “azatetracyclines.” One 7-azatetracycline and one 9-azatetracycline were disclosed in Myers original work, resulting in compounds with only modest antibacterial activity. Herein we demonstrate this powerful approach using pyridyl D-ring precursors 7 to generate novel 8-azatetracyclines, 10 (Scheme 1).
To explore 7- and 9-substituted-8-azatetracyclines, we required intermediates that could be readily modified either prior to or after construction of the protected compound 9. Thus, the halopyridines 15 and 16 were prepared according to Schemes 2 and 3. 3,5-Dichloroisonicotinic acid was treated with sodium benzylate to give compound 12, which was esterified to the phenyl ester 13 by conversion to the acid chloride, followed by treatment with phenol and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP). Suzuki coupling(18) using methylboronic acid and PdCl2Cy2 catalyst(19) gave the parent D-ring precursor 14 in good yield. N-Oxide formation with hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid followed by treatment with either phosphorousoxychloride or phosphorousoxybromide gave 15a and 15b, respectively. For 15a, the reaction gave a 4.5:1.0 ratio of the desired regioisomer, while a 25:1 ratio was observed for 15b. Both desired regioisomers were isolated in pure form by recrystallization. The regiochemistry was assigned by conversion to the dimethylamino compound 15c through a palladium-mediated amination.(20)1H NMR studies indicated an nOe between the methyl groups of the amine and the adjacent ring methyl group. The methoxy derivative 15d was prepared from 15b by treatment with sodium methoxide in 2-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) at 120 °C. This gave the acid directly, which was re-esterified to the phenyl ester.
Reagents and conditions: (i) NaH (2 equiv), BnOH, NMP, 80 °C; (ii) (COCl)2, cat. DMF, CH2Cl2; (iii) PhOH, Et3N, DMAP, CH2Cl2; (iv) CH3B(OH)2, PdCl2Cy2, K3PO4, toluene, water, 100 °C; (v) H2O2, AcOH, 80 °C; (vi) POCl3, toluene, 100 °C; (vii) POBr3, toluene, 100 °C; (viii) dimethylamine in THF, Pd2dba3, Xantphos, K3PO4, 1,4-dioxane, 100 °C (sealed); (ix) NaOMe, NMP, 100−120 °C.
Reagents and conditions: (i) for 15a, mCPBA, CH2Cl2; for 15b, H2O2, AcOH, 80 °C; (ii) POBr3, toluene, 100 °C; (iii) BocNH2, Pd2dba3, Xantphos, Cs2CO3, 1,4-dioxane, 80 °C; (iv) HCl, 1,4-dioxane; (v) HF-pyridine, NaNO2, pyridine; (vi) dimethylamine in THF, Pd2dba3, Xantphos, Cs2CO3, 1,4-dioxane, 60 °C (sealed).
The dihalo compounds 16a and 16b were prepared by N-oxidation of 15a and 15b followed by treatment with POBr3 (Scheme 3). Yields were typically moderate (45−50%), with reduction of the N-oxide to give the starting pyridines 15 observed as major side reactions in both cases. Palladium-mediated coupling of 16b with t-butylcarbamate gave a ∼2.5:1 mixture of regioisomers, which were readily separated after conversion to the free amine 16c upon treatment with HCl. Treatment of 16c with sodium nitrite in the presence of HF-pyridine gave the fluoro derivative 16d in good yield.(21) Similarly, a 2.4:1.0 ratio of regioisomers was observed in the palladium-mediated reaction of 16b with dimethylamine to give 16e and 16f. Interestingly, the regioselectivity could be reversed by heating 16b in the presence of dimethylamine without catalyst to give 16f as the major isomer in a 3:1 ratio.
The 9-amino D-ring precursors 18a and 18b were prepared according to Scheme 4. Once again, palladium-mediated couplings using t-butylcarbamate proved to be highly effective for introduction of the amino group. Further protection of the mono-Boc intermediates 17 with Boc2O and DMAP in DMF gave the di-Boc precursors 18.
Reagents and conditions: (i) BocNH2, Pd2dba3, Xantphos, Cs2CO3, 1,4-dioxane, 80 °C; (ii) Boc2O, DMAP, DMF.
Synthesis of the 8-azatetracyclines is outlined in Scheme 5. Most of the D-ring precursors were lithiated with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at −78 °C, followed by treatment with the enone 8. Warming to −20 °C yielded the fully protected tetracycline precursors 19. For D-ring precursors 16a, 16d, and 18b, a one-pot reaction was performed in which lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LHMDS) was added to a −78 °C solution of the precursor and the enone 8 followed by warming to −20 °C. Yields varied from 20 to 84% depending on substrate, with larger reaction scales generally providing better results. The LHMDS procedure also typically gave higher yields but was only possible on the more highly electron deficient D-ring precursors. The 7-bromo intermediate 19c was further derivatized at this stage via Suzuki couplings with methylboronic acid and phenylboronic acid to give 19d and 19e, respectively. Similarly, palladium-mediated amination with 19h and t-butylcarbamate provided the 7-chloro-9-amino compound 19j. Deprotection of the intermediates 19 with HF followed by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium on carbon gave the final 8-azatetracyclines 20a−k.
Reagents and conditions: (i) for 14, 15b−d, 16e, and 18a, LDA, TMEDA, −78 °C, THF then 8, −78 °C to −20 °C; (ii) for 16a, 16d, and 18b, LHMDS, 8, THF, −78 °C to −20 °C; (iii) CH3B(OH)2 or PhB(OH)2, PdCl2dppf2-CH2Cl2, K3PO4, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, water, 100 °C; (iv) BocNH2, Pd2dba3, Xantphos, K3PO4, 1,4-dioxane, 100 °C; (v) aqueous HF, CH3CN or 1,4-dioxane; (vi) 10% Pd/C, H2, HCl, MeOH, 1,4-dioxane.
To compare the 8-azatetracyclines directly to tigecycline, the 9-glycylamido-8-azatetracyclines 21a−c were prepared (Scheme 6). The Boc groups of compounds 19j−l were deprotected with HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Treatment with bromoacetylchloride in THF followed by excess t-butylamine gave the acylated intermediates, which were deprotected under standard conditions to give the final analogues 21a−c.
Reagents and conditions: (i) HCl, 1,4-dioxane; (ii) bromoacetylchloride, THF then t-BuNH2, 50 °C; (iii) aqueous HF, CH3CN or 1,4-dioxane; (iv) 10% Pd/C, H2, HCl, MeOH, 1,4-dioxane.
The bromopyridine intermediates proved to be useful for the introduction of alkylamines via palladium-mediated aminations and alkyl groups via Suzuki couplings, ultimately providing the 9-alkylamino-8-azatetracyclines 24 and 9-alkyl-8-azatetracyclines 26 (Scheme 7). Thus, 19h was treated with various amines in the presence of Pd2dba3 and 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis-(diphenylphosphino)xanthenes (Xantphos) in 1,4-dioxane at 100 °C. Potassium phosphate was found to be the most effective base for this transformation, with cesium carbonate and sodium t-butoxide leading to rapid decomposition. Low yields were generally observed due to decomposition of both the starting material and products upon heating. Reaction times of 2−4 h were eventually settled on as a balance between product formation and decomposition. Copper-catalyzed aminations were also explored, but rapid decomposition of the starting material was observed. Hindered amines generally gave low yields as did reactions with the 7-dimethylamino compound 19m. Alternatively, the alkylamines could be introduced prior to the Michael−Dieckmann reaction using either palladium or copper-mediated aminations(22) with 16a, 16d, and 16e. Protection of the resulting aminopyridines upon treatment with LHMDS followed by Boc2O or CbzCl gave the D-ring precursors 22. Michael−Dieckmann reaction then gave the protected intermediates 23. Suzuki reactions with 19h or 19m and various boronic acids were also carried out in moderate yields, providing the 9-alkyl intermediates 25. Deprotection of the intermediates under standard conditions gave the final 8-azatetracyclines 24 and 26.
Reagents and conditions: (i) R2R3NH2, Pd2dba3, Xantphos, K3PO4 or Cs2CO3, 1,4-dioxane, 100 °C or n-propylamine, CuI, 2-acetylcyclohexanone, K3PO4, DMF, 100 °C; (ii) LHMDS, THF then Boc2O or CbzCl; (iii) LDA, TMEDA, −78 °C, THF then 8, −78 °C to −20 °C or LHMDS, 8, THF, −78 °C to −20 °C; (iv) aqueous HF, CH3CN, or 1,4-dioxane; (v) 10% Pd/C, H2, HCl, MeOH, 1,4-dioxane; (vi) R2B(OH)2, (Ph3P)4Pd, K3PO4, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, H2O, 90 °C.
The in vitro antibacterial activities of all analogues were determined for a panel of Gram-positive (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram-negative (e.g., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. The activities of the 7-substituted-8-azatetracycline as well as several control tetracyclines for a representative set of these organisms are found in Table 1. The parent 8-azatetracycline 20a showed comparable activity to tetracycline, with reasonable minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.25−1 μg/mL for the tetracycline-susceptible strains. Lacking a substituent at either C-7 or C-9, 20a demonstrated poor activity for the strains bearing tet(M), tet(K), and tet(A). Overall, the 7-position appears to be very tolerant of substitution, allowing for bulky (20e), electron withdrawing (20b and 20i), and electron donating (20f and 20g) groups while maintaining activity against the tetracycline-susceptible strains. As with minocycline, introduction of the 7-dimethylamino group in 20f led to improved activities for most strains tested. Modest (1−2 dilution) improvements in MICs were observed for the tet(M) strains, while a more significant improvement was seen for the strain bearing the tet(K) resistance mechanism. With the exception of the 7-chloro analogue, all of the 7-substituted-8-aza compounds exhibited improved MICs for the tet(K) strain, correlating well with literature reports on 7-substituted tetracyclines. Unfortunately, all of the 8-azatetracyclines appear to be substrates for the tet(A) efflux pump, exhibiting no antibacterial activity at the highest concentration tested (32 μg/mL). In general, substitution at the 7-position appears to be inefficient at overcoming the ribosomal protection resistance mechanism of the tet(M) strains. The only compound with two dilution improvements for both tet(M) strains was compound 20i, the 7-fluoro analogue. This compound was also one of the more potent antibacterial compounds in this series.

To make a direct comparison to tigecycline, the 9-glycylamido-8-azatetracyclines were prepared (Table 2). Whereas tigecycline is a very potent antibacterial agent against all of the organisms in our panel, including the four strains bearing tetracycline resistance mechanisms, the corresponding 8-azatetracycline analogues 21a−c were found to have poor overall activity. The aniline precursors 20j and 20k, however, showed significant improvements in MICs for both tet(M) strains relative to the corresponding 9-unsubstituted compounds 20b and 20i. For the 7-Cl analogue 20j, antibacterial activity also improved for the tet(K) and wild type strains. These compounds were also assessed for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis in a cell-free transcription/translation assay (Table 3). In this assay, compounds 20j and 20k were about 2-fold more potent than tetracycline, in agreement with their relative MICs for E. coli. Compounds 21a−c, on the other hand, inhibited protein synthesis with IC50s between 0.42 and 0.90 μg/mL, similar to tigecycline, despite having only modest antibacterial activity in the whole-cell assays. These data suggest that the compounds are active at the target, but that compounds 21a−c are not capable of getting to the target in the whole-cell assay, possibly due to poor cell permeability.

ATCC 25922 is a tetracycline-susceptible strain.
On the basis of the results of compounds 20j and 20k, a series of 9-amino-8azatetracyclines was prepared (Table 4). Compounds bearing a small, unbranched alkylamino group at the 9-position (24a−c) proved to be very potent antibacterial agents against the two tetracycline-susceptible Gram-positive strains, with MICs between 0.016 and 0.25 μg/mL. A 4-fold improvement in activity against the tet(M) S. aureus strain was observed for all of these compounds relative to 20j, while MICs for the S. pneumoniae tet(M) strain were largely unchanged. For the tet(K) S. aureus strain, antibacterial activity improved with increasing size of the alkyl group. Among the tetracycline-susceptible Gram-negative strains, however, there was a clear loss in potency as the size of the alkyl group increased, a trend that continued for the larger branched alkyl compounds 24d−f. This is not surprising, as it is known that Gram-negative antibacterial agents tend to be smaller and more polar.(23) These larger side chains also adversely affected the antibacterial activity for S. pneumoniae while having less effect on the MICs for the S. aureus strains. The 7-fluoro-9-n-propylamino (24n) and 7-dimethylamino-9-n-propylamino (24o) analogues were prepared as comparisons to 24c. While the 7-fluoro compound had MICs that tracked fairly closely to the 7-chloro analogue, the 7-dimethylamino compound exhibited no antibacterial activity for any of the strains at the highest concentration tested (32 μg/mL) with the exception of the tetracycline-susceptible S. pneumoniae strain. All three of the compounds had similar, albeit weak, activity in the transcription/translation assay, indicating the differences in MICs might be due to poor permeability of the 7-dimethylamino analogue. Introduction of a more polar heteroatom into the side chain (24g−i,k) resulted in improved antibacterial activity against the S. pneumoniae and Gram-negative strains but had minimal effect on activity toward either resistant S. aureus organisms. Interestingly, the oxygen bearing side chains (24g and 24h) yielded significantly improved antibacterial activity toward tetracycline-susceptible Gram-positive strains relative to the all carbon side chains (24e and 24f), while the nitrogen analogues (24k and 24i) were less potent against S. aureus and showed more modest improvements against S. pneumoniae. The combination of a branched side chain with a distal amino group gave the most balanced antibacterial compounds in this series (24l, 24m, and 24j). These compounds combine good antibacterial activity toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with modest activity against tet(A) E. coli. Both compounds 24l and 24m are less potent than tigecycline but compare favorably to amadacycline.

The antibacterial activity of the 9-alkyl and phenyl substituted compounds were generally modest (Table 5). Here again, a larger substituent at C-9 yielded improved activity for tet(M) and tet(K) strains but resulted in loss of activity for wild type S. pneumoniae and Gram-negative strains. Introduction of a 7-Cl or 7-dimethylamino group also gave improved activity for most of the strains in the panel. When comparing the 7-Cl-9-alkyl compounds (26b) to the 7-Cl-9-aminoalkyl compounds (24c), it is clear that the nitrogen confers significant improvements in antibacterial activity. In the 7-dimethylamino case, however, the 7-dimethylamino-9-alkyl compound 26a is a balanced Gram-positive antibacterial agent while the 9-aminoalkyl compound 24o has no significant activity.

Compounds 20f and 24l were selected for further profiling. Both compounds inhibited protein synthesis in the transcription/translation assay with IC50s comparable to tigecycline. Susceptibility testing was performed, and MIC50 and MIC90 values were calculated for recent clinical isolates of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and E. coli (Table 6). The panels contained both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant strains, including 12 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. As expected from the initial MIC data, compound 20f had very potent antibacterial activity for the tetracycline-susceptible strains but performed poorly against the resistant organisms. The compound did have MIC90s that were significantly lower than tetracycline. Despite having higher MICs in the primary screen relative to tigecycline, compound 24l performed similarly in the S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae panels, exhibiting clinically relevant MIC90s in each case. These organisms are particularly relevant, as they are responsible for infections in a large portion of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia cases.
The pharmacokinetic profiles of the two 8-azatetracyclines were determined in Sprague−Dawley rats (Table 7). Compound 20f had very similar AUC, clearance, and volume of distribution profiles to both tetracycline and tigecycline, although the half-life was somewhat shorter. Low oral bioavailability (%F) of 12.7% was observed but was comparable to tetracycline (12.1%). In humans, tetracycline is generally reported to have oral bioavailability of 50−70%.(24) We and others have found the oral bioavailability of several tetracycline derivatives to be significantly lower in rat than reported data in humans. Tigecycline, administered only intravenously in humans, had very low oral bioavailability. Compound 24l had a 4-fold higher AUC and 5-fold lower clearance than the other three compounds as well as a significantly lower volume of distribution. Unfortunately, oral bioavailability was comparable to tigecycline.
Compounds were dosed at 1 mg/kg IV and 10 mg/kg PO with sterile water as vehicle.
The compounds were also investigated in mouse S. aureus and E. coli septicemia models (Table 8). Both 8-azatetracyclines performed well in the S. aureus model following IV administration, with PD50 values comparable to the two marketed control tetracyclines. 20f, the most potent of the four compounds, also provided the best protection, with 100% survival at the lowest dose at which it was administered (0.30 mg/kg). Despite having an 8-fold higher MIC, compound 24l provided equivalent protection relative to tigecycline, likely due to its higher AUC and lower clearance.(25) The E. coli model proved to be more challenging, requiring higher doses for protection. Compound 20f had a PD50 of 4.3 mg/kg compared to 2.1 mg/kg for tigecycline. Compound 24l was 4-fold less potent than 20f and was comparable to tetracycline in this model.
S. aureus ATCC 13709 (Smith) or E. coli ATCC 25922 was mixed with 5% mucin and inoculated by intraperitoneal injection at 2.1 × 106 cfu/mouse (S. aureus) or 2.0 × 107 cfu/mouse (E. coli). One hour postchallenge, mice received IV treatment (vehicle = sterile water) with the test article at concentrations ranging from 0.05−10 mg/kg (S. aureus) or 0.30−30 mg/kg (E. coli). The PD50 in mg/kg was calculated as survival after 48 h.
Lowest dose was 0.30 mg/kg with 100% survival at all doses.
A novel, fully synthetic series of 8-azatetracycline analogues was prepared and optimized. Through modification of the 7- and 9-positions, compounds were found that overcome both tet(K) efflux and tet(M)-mediated ribosomal protection. The 7-chloro-9-alkylamino-8-azatetracycline 24l exhibits clinically relevant MIC90 profiles against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms that include these resistance mechanisms. This compound also demonstrated in vivo efficacy in murine models of infection that is equivalent to currently marketed tetracycline antibacterial agents. The 7-dimethylamino-8-azatetracycline 20f was efficacious when administered intravenously and had oral bioavailability in rat equivalent to tetracycline.
The current work demonstrates the ability of this chemistry platform to generate antibacterial compounds that are inaccessible through traditional semisynthesis, providing the medicinal chemist a broader array of tools through which essential antibacterial properties can be modulated. Importantly, this includes the ability to overcome ever evolving resistance mechanisms and to identify structure−activity relationships to deliver compounds with desired pharmacokinetic properties.
Air and moisture sensitive liquids and reagents were transferred via syringe or cannula and were introduced into flame-dried glassware under a positive pressure of dry nitrogen through rubber septa. All reactions were stirred magnetically. Commercial reagents were used without further purification. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on EM Science precoated glass-backed silica gel 60 Å F-254 250 μm plates. Visualization of the plates was effected by ultraviolet illumination and/or immersion of the plate in a basic solution of potassium permanganate in water followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed on a FlashMaster Personal system using ISOLUTE Flash Si II silica gel prepacked cartridges (available from Biotage). Preparative reversed-phase HPLC chromatography (HPLC) was accomplished using a Waters Autopurification system with mass-directed fraction collection. All intermediate compounds were purified with a Waters Sunfire Prep C18 OBD column (5 μm, 19 mm × 50 mm; flow rate = 20 mL/min) using a mobile phase mixture of H2O (A) and CH3CN (B) containing 0.1% HCO2H. The final 8-azatetracycline compounds were purified using a Phenomenex Polymerx 10 μ RP 100A column (10 μm, 30 mm × 21.2 mm; flow rate = 20 mL/min) using a mobile phase mixture of 0.05N HCl in H2O (A) and CH3CN (B). All final 8-azatetracycline compounds were isolated as mono-, di-, or trihydrochloride salts following freeze-drying. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECX-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer and are reported in ppm using residual solvent as the internal standard (CDCl3 at 7.24 ppm, DMSO-d6 at 2.50 ppm, or CD3OD at 3.31 ppm). High performance liquid chromatography−electrospray mass spectra (LC-MS) were obtained using a Waters Alliance HPLC system equipped with a binary pump, a diode array detector, a Waters Sunfire C18 (5 μm, 4.6 mm I.D. × 50 mm) column, and a Waters 3100 series mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Spectra were scanned from 100 to 1200 amu. The eluent was a mixture of H2O (A) and CH3CN (B) containing 0.1% HCO2H at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Purity of the final compounds was assessed by the following method: (a) time = 0, 100% A; (b) time = 0.5 min, 100% A; (c) time = 3.5 min, 100% B; (d) time = 5 min, 100% B (e) time = 6 min, 100% A; (f) time = 7 min, 100% A. All final products were ≥95% purity as assessed by this method.
Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 4.37 g, 109 mmol) was added portionwise to a solution of 3,5-dichloroisonicotinic acid (10.2 g, 53.3 mmol) in NMP (100 mL). After gas evolution ceased, benzyl alcohol (5.52 mL, 53.3 mmol) was added dropwise. After gas evolution ceased, the reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C. After 1 h, the reaction was complete and was allowed to cool to room temperature and stand overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (300 mL) and was washed with Et2O (2 × 100 mL, discarded). The aqueous layer was brought to pH ∼2 with conc HCl, causing a precipitate to form. The mixture was diluted with brine (100 mL) and was allowed to stand for 30 min. The solid was collected by filtration, was washed with water (3×), and was dried in a 45 °C vacuum oven overnight. This gave 9.36 g (67%) of the title compound as a white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 14.30−14.10 (bs, 1 H), 8.52 (s, 1H), 8.34 (s, 1 H), 7.50−7.30 (m, 5 H), 5.33 (s, 2 H). MS (ESI) m/z 264.20 (M + H).
Oxalyl chloride (4.9 mL, 56 mmol) was added to a suspension of 12 (3.71 g, 14.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) over ∼2 min. DMF was added dropwise in ∼20 μL portions every 5 min until complete solution was achieved. After stirring for an additional 30 min, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50 mL), and phenol (2.65 g, 28.1 mmol), DMAP (0.172 g, 1.41 mmol), and Et3N (9.76 mL, 70.4 mmol) were added. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and was washed with water (2 × 100 mL) and NaHCO3 (saturated, aqueous, 100 mL). The organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The material was purified by column chromatography (Biotage 50 g column, 0−25% EtOAc in hexanes gradient), yielding 4.20 g (88%) of the product as an off-white solid.
