The aim of this study was to investigate whether video consultations in the home can support a viable alternative to visits to the hospital outpatient clinic for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. And furthermore whether patients, relatives, visiting nurses, and experts at the hospital will experience satisfaction and increased confidence with this new course of treatment. Participatory design methods were applied as well as field observations, semistructured interviews, focus groups, and qualitative analysis of transcriptions of telemedical consultations conducted during a pilot test. This study shows that it is possible for experts at the hospital to conduct clinical examinations and decision making at a distance, in close cooperation with the visiting nurse and the patient. The visiting nurse experienced increased confidence with the treatment of the foot ulcer and characterized the consultations as a learning situation. All patients expressed satisfaction and felt confidence with this new way of working.

Diabetes,late complications hereof, and diabetic foot ulcers in particular presentincreasing challenges in terms of amputations, sick leaves, reduced functioning,and escalating financial costs [1]. The patients' quality of lifedecreases dramatically with the occurrence of diabetic foot ulcers. Currently,most treatment is carried out by nonexperts such as visiting nurses and generalpractitioners [2, 3] despite the fact that studiesdemonstrate the importance of specialized knowledge in the treatment of chronicwounds [3, 4]. To enable the experts to monitoran increasing number of patients more regularly, telemedicine (telemedicine, inits broadest sense, means “delivery of healthcare and the exchange ofhealthcare information across distances” [5]) has been suggested as a way ofcreating alternative treatment methods [6].
Previousstudies have documented coherence between expert assessments of ulcers based ondigital images versus live assessment [7, 8]. Even low-resolution images maysometimes be sufficient [9, 10]. Digital photographs have alsoproven valuable in learning situations, for example, when giving directions forwound care [11]. Only a preliminary set ofexperiences exists in using the emerging UMTS (universal mobile telephony system) technologyfor telemedicine, for example, for teleconsultations from a moving ambulance [12], but so far the results arepromising.
Conclusionsfrom other studies demonstrate that expert-guided treatment makes nurses usemore advanced wound care remedies with better healing outcomes as a result [2, 3] and it leads to increased patient satisfaction through less travel and reduced waiting time [13–15]. Dansky and Bowles have evensuggested that communicating with the expert over a distance facilitates a moreoptimal dialog, which empowers the patients who participate more actively intheir care planning. This new communication form creates a new bond—a relationship based on partnership.
Furthermore, Dansky and Bowles found a significant learning curve for nursesand expect that the nurses will become increasingly comfortable and efficientas the technology becomes pervasive [16–18]. Another outcome of the KaiserPermanente Tele-Home Health Research Project was that the patients became moreactively involved in attending their own health care needs and the remotevisits were characterized as convenient because the patients felt comfortablewith discussing personal problems and in receiving care at home [14]. Treatment of diabetic ulcers hasturned out to be applicable to both synchronous [19] and asynchronous telemedicines [20]. Willbright found that telemedicinemade the specialist nurse more empowered and enabled to independently developtreatment plans [19].
Most ofthese studies have utilized a static installation in the patient's home or astore-and-forward solution for enabling the visiting nurse to receive advicefrom experts. Thus, the telemedical solutions have either connected the patientwith the visiting nurse, or the visiting nurse with the expert. To a largeextent, the treatment can be perceived as collaboration between these threestakeholders (the patient, the visiting nurse, and the expert). For thisreason, enabling the three partners to be simultaneously engaged in thecommunication taking place may increase the extent to which the expertknowledge can be utilized directly in the treatment. Furthermore, a directdialog between people with different perspectives may enable a more holisticview and thereby result in a more tailored treatment.
To pursuethis goal, we investigated the technological possibilities for supporting a neworganization of the treatment where the expert, the visiting nurse, and thepatient in collaboration could discuss the situation and plan the treatment.
In thisarticle, we present the results of a pilot test, the aim of which was toinvestigate the possibility of having the expert participating in the homeconsultations by the use of technology and in cooperation with the visitingnurse and the patient. In this article, we define “experts” as either a nurseor a doctor specialized in treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in our studylocated at Aarhus Hospital, Denmark. The visiting nurses referred to in this article are associated with local communitycenters in the residential area of the respective patients and they were nonexpertsin diabetic foot ulcers.
We explorethe subjective satisfaction of patients and healthcare professionals to testthe hypothesis that a telemedical consultation can be a viable alternative to avisit to the outpatient clinic. In order for a telemedical consultation to becharacterized as a viable alternative to a visit to the outpatient clinic, allparticipants must experience the telemedical treatment as satisfactory in termsof (1) the clinicians being provided with sufficient clinical information forclinical assessments and decisions to be made accurately, (2) the visitingnurses feeling supported and secured during the sessions, and (3) the patientbeing satisfied with the consultations. In the following, the findings relatedto these three issues are presented.
During a2-year process of participatory design, initial problems and potentialsolutions in the field of treatment of diabetic foot ulcers were investigated.Participatory design (PD) is a research approach, derived from action-based researchthat is applied to the development of technological and organizationalsolutions to real-world problems [21, 22]. PD is a qualitative study, inwhich the aim is to have close cooperation with the users during the process inorder to ensure that the (technological) result can be understood and handledin practice by the users [23]. In our study, the group ofparticipants consisted of hospital doctors and nurses specialized in diabeticfoot ulcers, visiting nurses, patients, and relatives. The PD process containedfield studies, workshops with the users, experiments in both laboratories and hospitals, and specification of an electronic ulcer record. The details of the methodology aredescribed in another article [24]. The PD process resulted in thecreation of a telemedical system for supporting the pilot test carried outduring summer 2005. This article reports the results of the test.
Fivepatients who were all mentally well functioning and following a course oftreatment in the outpatient clinic were selected for inclusion by the experts—the same hospital clinicians who hadparticipated in the PD process (1 doctor and 3 nurses). After the patients gaveinformed consent (including permission to film the video consultations), wecontacted the management of the patient's local center to inform about thestudy and to obtain permission to involve the patient's visiting nurse. Afterthat, we informed the visiting nurse in more detail and a meeting was set upfor demonstration of the technology. The project was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee.
Thepatients were offered 3 consecutive video consultations to substitute 3 visitsto the outpatient clinic all conducted by the same team of clinicians. Atelemedical course of treatment was initiated by an intensive consultation inthe outpatient clinic, where the experts created the patient file in the onlineulcer record and uploaded high-resolution images of the ulcer as well asobtaining measurements such as peripheral blood pressure, blood sugar. Furthermore, the first of the three telemedical consultations was prescheduledby the researchers with both the visiting nurse, the patient and the hospitalexperts.
Thetelemedical setup consisted of UMTS video telephones (Motorola A920) and acustom designed online ulcer record. Prior to the consultations, the visitingnurse used the video phone to take pictures of the ulcer and transmit them tothe ulcer record. As the video phones currently available on the market may notyet provide a sufficient image quality, the images from the phone weresupplemented with images from a standard digital camera (Nikon CoolPix5400).These high-resolution images were uploaded to the ulcer record upon return tothe office and therefore not available during the online consultations, butthey were used as a safety precaution. (The experts were able to view thosepictures later in cases of uncertainty. No changes were made to the assessmentor the treatment on the background of these images, however.) At the agreedtime of consultation, the visiting nurse made a video call from the home to thedoctor and to an expert nurse at the hospital. The experts used (1) the still images and the videostream from the video phones, (2) images from the previous consultation, and (3) the cooperation of the visiting nurse in order to evaluate the ulcer and toprescribe further treatment. After the consultation, the experts wrote theirsummary of the consultation in the online web-based record. Figure 1 shows twophotographs from one of the consultations.
Eachconsultation was video filmed by the researchers both in the patient's home andat the hospital and transcribed afterwards. After completion of the telemedicalexperiments, the researchers conducted semistructured interviews of one-hourduration with each of the 5 visiting nurses at their local center and with thepatients in their homes (which also involved a relative in 3 out of the 5 cases). Furthermore, we conducted a focus group interview with the 3 expert nurses togain a guided discussion (all expert nurses had been informally interviewedindividually after each consultation) and one individual semistructuredinterview with the doctor. As a final measure to circumvent amicable bias dueto the personal presence of the researchers in the interviews, all participantswere asked to indicate their satisfaction with every consultation in aquestionnaire.
The total datamaterial consisted of transcripts of field studies, workshops, experiments,interviews, and video consultations as well as the questionnaires and aspecification of the electronic ulcer record. The material was analyzedsystematically where data were categorized in themes arising during theanalysis, both concerning the participants’ satisfaction, as described in thisarticle as well as themes described in other articles elsewhere.
The 15 consultationswere performed as planned. Using UMTS for telemedicine was a challenge. Varioustechnical difficulties arose as described in another article [25]. The technical difficulties did not, however,prevent the pilot test to be carried out as planned, and the clinical resultsof the test are presented in this article. A wide range of clinical situationswere encountered ranging from a noncritical healing ulcer to more complicatedulcers, and at one consultation the decision was a hospital admission. Inanother case, a patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for face-to-facespecialist evaluation; however, the clinical conclusion based on thetelemedical consultation remained unchanged. The consultations lasted from 5 to 18 minutes, including the dialogs between nurses and patients and also including scheduling a time for the ensuing video consultation. The course of 3 following consultations for each patient lasted from 2 weeks to 6 weeks.
The overall resultsfrom the study demonstrate that the alternate course of treatment proved satisfactoryfrom the viewpoint of all 3 stakeholders. The experts were both satisfied withthe new course of treatment and they felt secure in being responsible for thetreatment performed on a distance. The visiting nurses were satisfied and feltsupported in carrying out the treatment. The patients (and relatives) feltsecure and characterized the treatment as an improvement because they were ableto remain at home.
After theconsultations, the experts expressed satisfaction with the clinical basis fortheir decision making. Both the information provided in the form of picturesand communication with the patient and the cooperation with the visiting nurseconstituted important basis for the experts' decision making. “The presence ofthe visiting nurse in the patient’s home compensates in full for not having thepatient in front of you,” the doctor said in the interview.
By cooperating withthe visiting nurse and being precise when asking questions, the experts wereable to gather the information they would normally observe themselves,including the color, temperature, and smell of the foot ulcer. The high-resolutionimages from the digital camera were “even better than the human eye as theycompared in quality to using a magnifying glass,” explained the doctor in theinterview. However, as these pictures were uploaded following eachconsultation, the experts had only access to high-resolution images from theprevious consultations at the time of the consultation. For this reason, theless optimal images from the video phones provided the main basis for thedecisions, and if these images were not optimal in terms of, for example,lightning or sharpness, the visiting nurse observations were particularlyuseful. The possibility of comparing pictures of an ulcer from one visit to thenext also supported the assessment of healing progress.
An important decisionto make for the experts was how much responsibility could be delegated to thevisiting nurse. The expert nurses had the possibility to get a feeling of thevisiting nurses skills and if extra help was needed in carrying out theprescribed treatment. The expert nurse noted that she could value the visitingnurses level of competences just by looking at the way she handled theinstruments. These observations lead the expert nurse towards what kind ofinstruction the visiting nurses needed or what she was able to ask from her.The doctor also assessed the competence of the visiting nurse, and described itin this way: “I’m used to asking 3 questions and then I can almost grade them(the visiting nurses).”
In the beginning ofthe pilot test, the roles of the participants in the telemedical consultationswere not defined prior to each consultation. During the pilot tests, a firmerstructure for the consultation gradually evolved. For instance, the expertsbecame more aware of the fact that they had to combine their own views withthat of the visiting nurse, and that the consultations were most efficient ifone person took the lead. For these reasons, the experts made it a practice to hold a preconsultation to coordinate their impression before hearing the visiting nurse. They were conscious, however, not to put forward their impression at the actual consultation until they had heard what the visiting nurse had to say in order to be able to combine their own impression from the images with the subjective opinion of the visiting nurse. Furthermore, the ongoing dialog—once connected—brings forth issues that have an impact on thedecisions, for instance, aspects of the patient’s daily living. The directdialog with the visiting nurse provides the expert with a more detailedknowledge about the patient and the capabilities of the patient’s surroundings (e.g., the service levels at the local center). These issues would have beenmore difficult to pursue in a hospital setting, where the knowledge of thevisiting nurse is absent. Consequently, in terms of the expert’s basis fordecisions, the video consultation provided a feasible alternative to a visit inthe outpatient clinic; and in some cases, the decision basis may even be moreholistic.
The visiting nurseswere all positive towards the video consultations, which is in line withprevious studies (see, e.g., [26]). They felt professionally supported incarrying out the treatment. Four out of five visiting nurses emphasized thatparticipating in the project had increased their professional skills, byreceiving information and instructions from the hospital. In contrast to thesituation today, the direct contact with the experts means that a treatmentplan may be decided and any discrepancies sorted out immediately. The visitingnurse is also instructed about new treatments which he/she understands morereadily on the basis of expert reflections and explanations.
In this way, thedialog facilitates a decision process based on mutual understanding rather thanthe expert giving direct instructions. This ensures that the visiting nurse canrelate to the treatment plan, which promotes satisfaction with the cooperation.In the interview, this particular visiting nurse was asked, if she at timestook offence by receiving instructions on her professional field. She answered: “No, I think there has been room for me to express my opinions … If I had had adifferent opinion I would have had the possibility for discussing it. I feelthere was two-way communication.”
The visiting nursesalso agreed that the treatment procedures would improve when working in a teamwith the experts. As one nurse explained: “When I work on my own, I sometimesdoubt if the treatment is sufficient, or if a doctor should see the ulcer. Tobe on the safe side I sometimes send the patient to the hospital, but when thepatient returns, it is still the same treatment that was prescribed in thefirst place. This means that I misjudged the situation—that would not happen with this set-up.” Thevisiting nurse became the central coordinating actor combining the two roles asthe “patient’s advocate” and the expert’s “prolonged arm.” One nurse quoted: “With the doctor Ifind out which treatment is necessary, and with the patient I find out if thatis what we need. … It (her role) is more “here and now,” more present. It is agood role to have.” The collaboration facilitated a synergetic combination ofthe actors’ individual competences. “What they need on the hospital is what thevisiting nurse can see in the home” (quote VN). Furthermore, the nursesexpressed that the knowledge attained through the cooperation with the expertswould also benefit their other patients. In this sense, the telemedical organizationcould enable more tailored treatment for the individual patient, whichultimately may increase the quality of the treatment.
The patients expressedthat being able to stay at home during treatment was a great advantage. In consistencywith other studies [13, 27], patients complain about spending many hourswaiting for transportation to the hospital, waiting in the outpatient clinic,and again waiting for transportation home.
The video consultationfocused not just on the ulcer, but included the patient as well. When theconsultation is performed in the patient’s home, patients are moreself-confident and more apt to ask about personal issues, such as sleepingproblems, pain, medication [17]. Onepatient quoted: “I find it reassuring—it is not always that you get to askthe questions you have when you go up there (to the hospital)—it is easierwhen you are in your home.” Another patient described the consultation in thefollowing way: “The contact between the visiting nurse and the experts is good. They work as a team.” By having access to the expert and the visiting nurse atthe same time, the patients are able to receive immediate answers to theirquestions and at the same time follow the visiting nurse getting instructionsfrom the expert.
The online dialog wasaccepted by the patients: “It is easier to make contact, when there is apicture, in which you can see the person instead of only a phone. I felt safe.I think the doctor cared for me as a person, he showed interest in me.” Thepatients and relatives felt both satisfied and secured by being treated at adistance.
In a few situations,the patients were surprised about how serious problems were taken. Forinstance, during one consultation a patient had signed up for a Midsummer Eve arrangement,but the experts found it necessary to rest the foot as much as possible andsuggested a wheel chair. In the interview, the patient said that if he had nottalked to the expert, “I would just have walked to the party.” A similarstatement was given by the visiting nurse in the interview: “I would not havereacted towards the newly arisen blister and, furthermore, I would have treatedthe blister in a very different way than the one prescribed by the expertnurse.”
Our study indicatesthat treatment of diabetic ulcers in the home can be effectively supported bymeans of telemedicine. From the point of view of all three stakeholders(patient, visiting nurse, and expert), the simultaneous dialog facilitatessatisfactory means for handling the cooperation and treatment.
To the experts, thecommunication with the patient in his own home environment brings to lightpersonal issues enabling a better and more individual treatment. This may alsohave preventive effects as demonstrated in the case of the person attending theMidsummer Eve party. Contrasting indirect telemedical solutions, where digitalimages are obtained and forwarded to the expert by email (store-and-forward),our setup allows the participants to informally discuss, reflect upon, andsolve discrepancies immediately in order for the treatment decision to beinitiated straight away. Furthermore, the mobile setup makes it unnecessary toinstall and maintain equipment in the patient’s home.
While the studies by,for instance, Bowles and Dansky [16] investigate online connections between patientand expert directly, without the attendance of the visiting nurse who has theresponsibility for carrying out the treatment between the expert consultations,our setup allows both the expert and the visiting nurse to participate activelyin the expert consultations. This forgesa synergetic combination of the different stakeholders’ competences. At thesame time, the web-based online ulcer record facilitates a more traditionalstore-and-forward setup, and this study shows that the combination of these twomethods is valuable in that the doctor and expert nurse could use the recordfor obtaining an overview of the situation and history, while at the same timecollaborating with the visiting nurse and patient about the present situation.
As reported by others [8, 28], an important spinoff effect is that thecompetence of the visiting nurse may increase during this telemedicalconsultation facilitating the spread of knowledge from expert to the community.
In our study, the sameteam of clinicians conducted all 3 consultations with each patient, especially thepatients experienced this to be a major advantage. This will not always bepossible in a large-scale implementation. Thus, an important question to beinvestigated in future studies is the challenge of enabling experts to followup on the basis of other persons’ descriptions and examinations.
It is also of vitalimportance that the initial visit to the outpatient clinic prior to thetelemedical course of treatment should serve to get to know the patient interms of the patient’s ability to participate in a course of treatment built onvideo consultations, which involves a thorough examination of the patientincluding measures such as peripheral blood pressure. Thereby, the patientobtains high quality and continuity in the treatment.
Both expert nurses andvisiting nurses gained new roles in the telemedical setup. From the beginningof the study, the expert nurses were worried about not having the patient face toface and not having “the finger in the ulcer,” whereas the expert doctor tendedto be more open to the concept, possibly because doctors are more used todelegating work tasks to others. The final focus group interview after thepilot test revealed that also the expert nurses were now confident with the newrole as a consultant working through another nurse.
Communication throughvideo phones puts constraints to the natural flow of the conversation in termsof delays and difficulties to interpret nonverbal cues and expressions. Forthis reason, all participants had to be conscious about their expressions andwe recommend attention and training in this way of communication beforeimplementing similar telemedical services.
The visiting nurse wasinvited into the experts’ reflections, which meant that her role went fromcarrying out the prescribed treatment on her own and without formal influenceto be a fully fledged member of a collaborating team. Working through guidancefrom the experts, the visiting nurses became more engaged, secure, andresponsible in carrying out the treatment. The competences and skills of thevisiting nurse are likely to increase from each consultation, resulting inincreased job satisfaction and qualifications.
In all consultationsperformed during our pilot test, the three criteria for the consultation to becharacterized as a viable alternative to a visit in the outpatient clinic weremet. The experts expressed satisfaction with their basis for decisions, thevisiting nurses felt supported, and the patients experienced the new way ofreceiving treatment as an advantage. Furthermore, the simultaneouscommunication between expert, visiting nurse, and patient enabled theclinicians to provide a more holistic and tailor-made treatment, indicating that thetelemedical consultations are a viable way of performing the treatment.
