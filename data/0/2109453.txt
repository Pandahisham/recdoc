Atypical gap junctions in the ciliary epithelium of the albino rabbit eye

Gap junctions are present between nonpigmented and pigmented epithelial cells layers, as well as between the adjacent pigmented cells, but not between the nonpigmented epithelial cells which face the posterior chamber.  The unusual feature of these gap junctions is a dark banding which regularly appears every three rows of subunits.  This dark band is the equivalent width of two rows of facets.
