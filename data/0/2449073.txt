Folic acid prescription in pregnancy.

We resolved to prescribe folic acid supplements for all women who attended this practice during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Six months after this decision a prescription was recorded in only 13% of cases: this compared with 18% during the two months immediately following the decision. It was resolved to improve this performance and observations six months later revealed a prescription recorded in 63% of cases. Subsequently a new form for recording an antenatal consultation was devised and six months after its implementation, 100% recording of folate prescription for appropriate cases was observed. It was concluded that these simple audit exercises prompted changes in practice which helped to improve standards of patient care.
