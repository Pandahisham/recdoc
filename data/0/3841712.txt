Spectacle sign


Sir,
We would like to highlight the importance of spectacle sign while interpreting chest X-ray. According to Sir Benjamin Felson, the father of chest radiography, spectacle sign is the presence of a round radio-opacity seen adjacent to an end on bronchus.[1] The pulmonary vessel appears as radio-opacity while the bronchus appears as lucency adjacent to the radio-opacity. The two shadows together give the appearance of spectacle sign as shown in [Figures 1 and 2].

We wish to emphasize that both clinicians and radiologists should be aware of this sign who are regularly seeing and interpreting chest X-rays. The presence of this sign may give an erroneous appearance of the abnormal nodular opacity, metastasis in a known primary, enlarged hila, broncholith, calcified lymph node or a bony pathology.
