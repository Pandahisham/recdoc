Scientific abstracts presented at the International Congress for Clinicians in Complementary & Integrative Medicine 2013
Focus Area: Experiential Workshop
Not all who adhere to vegetarian, vegan, or other special diets have nutritionally sound eating habits. The clinical consequences of an insufficiently mindful vegetarian or vegan diet include many common symptoms such as anxiety, brain fog, depression, fatigue, insomnia, neuropathies, and other neurologic dysfunction. Patients with such symptoms who report having a vegetarian or vegan diet or a diet that severely restricts meat consumption require a slightly expanded differential diagnosis. The clinical challenge is to identify which patients require closer attention. This workshop introduces 7 questions for all clinicians for rapid assessment of potential dietary drivers of clinical symptoms. This approach supports patient insights on mindful eating practices including optimal food choices for optimal health.
