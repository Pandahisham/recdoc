Are the birds feeding you Campylobacter?

During May and June 1992 there was a marked increase in reports of campylobacter infections compared with other years. Several affected patients mentioned they had been drinking milk from bottles previously pecked by birds. A case control study was initiated to investigate whether there was any significant association. It was concluded that drinking milk pecked by birds was associated significantly with subsequent campylobacter infection.
