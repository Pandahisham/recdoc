Solitary cutaneous leiomyomata: a clinicopathological study of 28 cases.

Twenty-eight cases of solitary cutaneous leiomyomata were encountered in a ten-year period. They occurred in nine males and nineteen females, the mean age at presentation being 53 years. The lesions occurred most commonly on the lower limbs and 36% were painful. Solitary cutaneous leiomyomata were found to differ from the better known syndrome of multiple cutaneous leiomyomata, in that they did not recur after excision and were not associated with leiomyomata at other body sites.
