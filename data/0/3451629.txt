Report of cluster headache in a pair of monozygous twins

A pair of identical twins with cluster headache is described. Monozygosity was confirmed by the identification of 14 DNA markers. In spite of harboring the same genes, the clinical picture presented by the twins was not exactly the same. Cluster headache is probably the best known trigeminal-autonomic cephalalgia, but several questions regarding its pathophysiology remain to be answered. The cases described herein reinforce the role of genetic aspects in its etiology.
