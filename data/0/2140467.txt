COMPARATIVE STUDIES ON RESPIRATION 

 1. The addition of Na taurocholate produces an increase in the rate of respiration at a concentration of 0.0000125 M, and a decrease at 0.001 M and in higher concentrations. 2. NaCl is antagonized by Na taurocholate, the most favorable proportion being 14,375 parts of NaCl to 1 part of Na taurocholate (molecular proportions). 3. Solutions of saponin, at concentrations from 0.00005 M to 0.001 M, decrease the rate of respiration: lower concentrations produce no effect.
