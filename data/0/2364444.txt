Background: In the late 1960s, the first isolates of Aeromonas were recovered from human specimens. Presently, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the different isolates of the genus Aeromonas are human pathogens. The most frequent site of infection is the digestive tract, although extraintestinal infection also occurs. In those cases involving septicemia, most infections occur in individuals with underlying diseases. This report presents the case of a pregnant woman with no underlying disease or signs of immunodeficiency who developed A. hydrophila septicemia at 24 weeks gestation.
Case: A 20-year-old pregnant woman was admitted with a history of 10 days of fever, chills, and diaphoresis. Three days before her hospitalization, she noted jaundice and choluria. Her liver was enlarged and her liver function tests were abnormal, with a moderate elevation of serum aminotransferases and direct serum bilirubin and a high serum alkaline phosphatase. Her blood and bone-marrow cultures revealed A. hydropkila. She was treated with parenteral ceftriaxone. She experienced a complete remission of her symptoms and laboratory abnormalities after therapy. The remainder of the pregnancy was normal. At 39.2 weeks gestation, she delivered a healthy male infant.
Conclusion: An association was noted between pregnancy and A. hydrophila septicemia in a woman without immunodeficiency or underlying disease, possibly indicating another infectious complication in pregnancy.
