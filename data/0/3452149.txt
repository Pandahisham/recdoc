Ictal and interictal EEG findings inchildren with migraine

We describe the electroencephalographic findings in ninepediatric migraineurs during the ictal phase of pain. Weobserved abnormal patterns on electroencephalography (EEG) inseven patients with migraine with aura and in two patients withbasilar migraine. These patients were also evaluated with EEGduring headache-free interval, at least 7 days after the ictalevent; these interictal findings were unremarkable, confirmingthe observations reported in the literature. Finally, we reviewmigraine and its EEG characteristics as reported in theliterature, and discuss the value of EEG performed duringinterictal and ictal phases of migraine.
