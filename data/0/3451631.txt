A case of a GH–producing pituitary adenoma associated with a unilateral headache with autonomic signs

A 66–year–old man sufferedfrom a drug–resistant, leftsidedheadache with autonomicsigns, triggered by the supineposition. The acromegalic faciesinitially suggested a possibleincrease in basal plasma levels ofGH, but routine haematologicalcontrols excluded abnormal valuesof GH. Cerebral and facial CTscan and MRI did not detect anyalterations in the nasal sinuses,except for a mucous cyst. Surgicalablation of the cyst did not alleviatethe pain. Further endocrinologicaltests demonstrated an increaseof IGF–1 (somatomedin C), andanother MRI scan of the sellarregion confirmed the presence of apituitary macroadenoma on theleft paramedian side. After an initialimprovement of the symptomatologydue to trans–sphenoidalablation of a benign GH–producingmacroadenoma, the headacheworsened again. Pain was wellcorrelated with the increased plasmalevels of IGF–1. The patientdied suddenly for myocardialinfarct.
