THE SERUM FERMENTS AND ANTIFERMENT DURING PNEUMONIA 

 1. The crisis in pneumonia is usually accompanied by (a) decrease in the serum antiferment; (b) the mobilization of a non-specific protease in the serum; (c) an increase in serum lipase; (d) a decrease in the non-coagulable nitrogen, and of the proteoses in the serum. 2. The crisis is associated with the beginning of an active autolysis, the latter depending on an altered relation between the ferment-antiferment balance. 3. The fibrin and leucocytic debris must be considered as one of the potential sources of toxic substances. With rapid autolysis proceeding, only non-toxic materials are absorbed.
