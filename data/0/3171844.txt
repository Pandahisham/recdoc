Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue used as eye drops in glaucoma treatment. Known side effects are iridial and periocular hyper-pigmentation, eyelash changes including pigmentation, increased thickness, length and number. Latanoprost has already shown efficacy in the treatment of eyelash alopecia, but knowledge on its effects on human scalp hair growth is not available. To assess efficacy on hair growth and pigmentation. Furthermore to evaluate the effect on scalp pigmentation and the treatment duration needed to affect the hair growth, hair pigmentation, and scalp pigmentation, as well as to assess the safety of latanoprost. Sixteen male with mild androgenetic alopecia were included. Latanoprost 0.1% and placebo were applied daily for 24 weeks on two minizones on the scalp. Measurements on hair growth, density, diameter, pigmentation and anagen/telogen ratio were performed throughout the study. A significantly increased hair density compared to baseline was observed on the latanoprost-treated site after 24 weeks (P<0.001). Furthermore a significant difference in hair density between the investigational sites after 24 weeks could be evaluated (P=0.0004). No major adverse events were recorded. Latanoprost significantly increased hair density and the amount of vellus hairs compared to baseline as well as the placebo-treated area from eight weeks on of topical treatment. Latanoprost could be useful in stimulating hair follicle activity and treating hair loss.
