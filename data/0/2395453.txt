A 78-year-old man presented with a mass on his right forearm. A 5 x 4 x 3 cm3 mass was excised en bloc with extensions alongthe course of the cephalic vein and its tributaries. Histological analysis revealed the mass to be a high-grade leiomyosarcomaarising within the cephalic vein. The tumour was controlled locally and distally until the patient died 10 months later, froman unrelated illness. This is the first reported case of a venous leiomyosarcoma of the cephalic vein.
