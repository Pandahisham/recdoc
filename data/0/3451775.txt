Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a rare headachesyndrome resulting in non-remitting, recurrent, intense,short-lasting pain, with typical, often total, responsiveness toindomethacin. Other drugs have anecdotally been reported to bepotentially effective. Apparent unreponsiveness, in fact due tointolerance to this non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, canlead to doubt about the initial diagnosis. Two such cases ofCPH, for whom effective alternative treatment was eventuallygiven, are described.
