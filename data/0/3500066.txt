Healthy hair occurs when the scalp is healthy. Several activities can damage the hair. Heat is commonly used on the hair to dry wet hair and for hair styling. The exposure of the hair to high heat results in denaturation of the hair proteins, which weakens the hair shaft through the formation of bubbles. These bubbles are created when the water in the hair shaft changes from liquid to gas and pops off the cuticular scale as it escapes. The cuticular scale can also be removed by scratching of the scalp. Since it is impossible to scratch the scalp without scratching the hair, seborrheic dermatitis may result in hair loss. After 45 min of scratching, the cuticle is completely removed from the hair shaft. Elimination of the malassezia globosa and malassezia restricta is the key to controlling seborrheic dermatitis and minimizing hair damage from scratching.
