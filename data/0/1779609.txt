The First Asia-Oceania Research Organisation on Genital Infectionsand Neoplasia (AOGIN) Meeting was held in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia,in July 2005. The conference covered regional issues relating toinfection with the human papillomavirus—epidemiology, virology,and immunology, testing, screening, and prevention strategies—aswell as cervical cancer screening and its management.

Cancer prevention and control are among the most important publichealth challenges facing the world today.
Worldwide, carcinoma of the uterine cervix is the second mostcommon cancer in women. Incident cases are estimated to beapproximately 470 600 per annum, with almost 80% occurring inthe developing world.
The AOGIN concept was based upon an expert multidisciplinary groupdeveloped overseas—the European Research Organisation on GenitalInfection and Neoplasia (EUROGIN).
This organisation crosses professional boundaries, unitinggynaecology, sexual health, dermatology, epidemiology/publichealth, pathology, biology, oncology, and basic science.
AOGIN aims are to promote and develop research, training,screening, prevention, and information concerning genitalinfections, precancers, and cancers in women.
New breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention willprovide both opportunities and challenges in upcoming years. AOGINactivity should assist decision-making and planning so that themost cost-effective gains can be made for each nation.
The work will focus oncollaboration and research,scientific exchanges, education and training,information provision,surveys and audits.

The first AOGIN Meeting was held in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, inJuly 2005. It was coordinated by an executive committee thatincluded leading physicians from Australia, Japan, Korea,Singapore, India, and China.
The meeting was generously supported by a number of pharmaceuticaland diagnostic companies, and received helpful input fromprofessional societies. Delegates from 23 nations attended themeeting and gave insights into HPV and cervical cancerepidemiology and management in their countries.
Globocan data suggest that around 470 000 cases of cervicalcancer are diagnosed worldwide every year [1]. While this isa far lower incidence than for breast cancer (1 050 000diagnoses per year), cervical cancer remains the second mostcommon cancer for women. Colon/rectal cancer, lung cancer, andstomach cancer, which can affect both men and women, all havelower incidences at 446 000, 387 000, and 418 000,respectively.
The relative incidence for different cancers varies significantlybetween regions. In North America, cervical cancer is not amongthe leading seven cancers diagnosed in women, nor among the topseven cancers that result in death.
A very different scenario exists in Central/South America (wherecervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer diagnosis andcause of death), Africa (most frequent cancer diagnosis and causeof death), and Asia (second most frequent cancer diagnosis andfourth most frequent cause of death).
It is estimated that the lifetime risk of any woman experiencingcervical cancer is 3–4%. Yet age adjusted rates (AARs) vary from as high as 42.7 in Eastern Africa and 38.2 in Southern Africa, to as low as5.8 in Western Asia [1].
HPV is a small DNA virus that demonstrates significant geneticvariation, with more than 100 types identified and sequenced todate. Two oncogenes associated with the virus have beenidentified, and are known as E6 and E7, which have the ability todegrade the proteins of the cellular genes p53 and Rb, thusinterfering with essential mechanisms of cell proliferation andrepair. A different section of viral DNA has been shown to beimmunogenic and appears to generate a protective response.
The pathogenicity of the viruses varies: some types (such as 6 and11) are linked to genital warts, while others (such as 16 and 18)are frequently seen in women diagnosed with invasive cervicalepithelial abnormalities or cancer. Infection does not inevitablylead to pathological changes; regression occurs in some cases.
Interestingly, HPV prevalence among the general population issignificantly higher in North-Eastern Africa (34.0%) andCentral/South America (23.5%) than in other regions. In Asia,incidence is higher in the East (13.8%) and South-central(11.9%) areas than in Japan-Taiwan (7.4%) and South-EastAsia (4.9%).
Worldwide, a review of the prevalence of the 11 most common HPVtypes in HPV-positive cervical cancer cases (n = 2855) indicatesthat although frequencies varied, HPV 16 followed by HPV 18 weremost commonly detected in Africa, Central-South America, SouthAsia, and North America. HPVs 45, 31, and 33 were also seenglobally [2].
HPVs 16 and 18 appear to be most frequent in cases of high-gradesquamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or invasive casesof squamous cell caroinoma (SCC), although the relative incidenceof different types varies in different regions [3].
HPV is now established as a causative agent for cervical cancer,with 95% of cervical cancer specimens testing positive for HPVDNA using GP5+/6+ primers PCR. Cofactors that increase therisk of cervical cancer include high parity, oral contraceptiveuse, smoking, and HIV infection. Diet, low socioeconomic status, andother genital infections also appear to influence risk.
The variation in distribution and age-prevalence for differenttypes of HPV varies between countries. However, the distributionof HPV types in cervical cancer shows universal dominance of HPVs16 and 18, with some variability thereafter [4]. The 15 types that explain 95+% of cervical cancer do not show significantvariability.
Papilloma viruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that replicateonly in the skin cells of their host species. They do not grow incell culture.
There are many different immunologically distinct types of HPVs,which have been linked to specific conditions—genital warts(HPVs 6, 11); genital cancer (HPVs 16, 18); epidermodysplasiaverruciformis EV (HPVs 5, 8); and cutaneous warts (HPVs 1, 2).
HPV infects stem cells in the skin. Because the virus does notkill the host cell, it must wait for cell shedding (desquamation)to escape. The viruses do not generate an inflammatory response.
In cancer-causing HPVs, recognition by the immune system relies ongrowth-regulating segments known as E6 and E7. These proteinsextend cell proliferation and retard cell differentiation, but donot inevitably result in malignancy. Cancerous transformationoccurs only in vivo. On a cellular level, it is not known why someHPV types are more likely to induce cancer than others.
HPV infection is common and is usually acquired soon after sexualactivity commences. Most HPV infections regress without treatment.Less than one in 50 women infected with HPV 16 will show residualinfection after 5 years. Progression of infection to precancer isslow and uncommon [5].
Yet every year, around 250 000 women die as a result of cervicalcancer, and HPV is almost always present (99.8%). The mostcommon type of HPV seen in cervical cancer is HPV 16(∼ 60%).
Currently, the only method of preventing cervical cancer is toidentify precancerous lesions early and treat them. However,vaccines may prevent infection with high-risk HPV viruses,breaking the cycle far earlier.
Although the response is slow, HPV generates a type-specificimmune reaction [6]. While this virus is not highlyimmunogenic, regression of HPV is dependent on this immuneresponse—it occurs less frequently in immunocompromised patientssuch as renal transplant recipients. Details of this immuneresponse are not completely understood, but humoral, cellular, andinnate immunity may all play a role.
The WHO recognised that without a standard reference serum toenable laboratories to standardise the calibration of HPV antibodytesting, monitoring of vaccination programmes would be unreliable.
Test sera (particularly HPV 16) were distributed to 10 interestedlaboratories. Although all laboratories ranked the sera in thesame order, there was significant variation in cut-offs forseropositivity. The study demonstrated that there was no universalability to rank weakly reactive sera and to avoid crossreactivity [7].
Sufficient positive serum is being gathered to make a referenceserum, which may be available by the end of 2006.
Laboratory procedures with known, consistent specificity andsensitivity for detecting and typing HPV are needed to conducteffective epidemiological surveys and vaccine evaluation. Thestandardisation of HPV assays is still evolving and requiresexternal quality assessment.
HPV DNA testing may be used clinically forscreening, either alone or as an adjunct to cytology,triage of patients with uncertain Pap results,monitoring patients post-treatment.

The presence of HPV can be identified bycytology (Pap smears),histology,electron microscopy,immunohistochemistry (identification of group-specificantigen),molecular tests (including in-situ hybridisation, dot blottechniques and others requiring amplification of viral DNA),serology (detection of capsid proteins or VLPs).Amplification of viral DNA may be through target amplification(PCR) or signal amplification (Hybrid Capture II).

The Hybrid Capture II Assay (HC II) has been approved by the FDAand is available in microtitre format. An exfoliated cervicalsample is assayed against different probe groups. This techniqueinvolves five specific stages and results are not type-specific,although low- and high-risk probe mixes are available.
PCR is highly sensitive, permits both detection and genotyping,and allows testing of different sample types including archivalsamples with poorer quality DNA. However, inhibitors in clinicalspecimens can lead to false-negative results, and contaminationmay result in false-positives. Most assays target the L1 region ofviral DNA, but primers and detection systems vary.
ELISA-based microtitre plate format, reverse line blot/ stripassays, and microarray DNA chip assays can be used for PCR-basedgenotype-specific detection.
Roche has developed AMPLICOR HPV which uses a microwellplate-based ELISA technique to amplify and detect 13 high-risk HPVtypes.
In a preliminary study at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne,Australia, HC II and AMPLICOR were compared by testing a range ofsamples; outcomes were compared to histology/cytology results.Both assays were positive for the 1 case of cancer, and of 38samples with histologically confirmed HSIL lesions, Amplicordemonstrated an 89% sensitivity compared with 79% for HC II.The tests were less sensitive in predicting LSIL lesions: HC IIand Amplicor detected 50% and 59%, respectively. The twotests had similar numbers of positives (∼ 9%) forthose with normal histology, although these were a high-riskpopulation, having previously had an abnormal Pap.
Line blot or line-probe assays can be used to recognise differentgenotypes of HPV. These PCR techniques are detailed and intensive.
HPV DNA testing is an objective test that will play an increasingrole in the management of women with minor cytologicalabnormalities, as the results are more sensitive and reproduciblethan Pap smears in determining a woman's risk of having underlyingHSIL, the precursor lesion for cervical cancer [8]. Incombination with Pap cytology, the negative predictive valueapproaches 100%, resulting in fewer unnecessary colposcopies.
However, communication, education, and counselling will be requiredfor women testing positive to HPV DNA. There is a high prevalenceof HPV in clinically normal young women, and most infections aretransient. Repeat testing is the sole means of determining HPVpersistence.
International standard reagents provide a helpful tool forhigh-quality HPV amplification, detection, and genotyping. The WHOhas a panel working towards standards that will enablelaboratories to measure their results in relation to other groups.
Knowing specificity and sensitivity of particular HPV genotypingmethods is crucial for epidemiological surveys, vaccineevaluation, and ongoing monitoring of vaccine performancefollowing deployment. Complete protection against persistent HPVinfection in vaccinated women has been demonstrated by twodifferent HPV preventative vaccines in independent studies[9, 10].
HPV detection or even persistence is not an appropriate endpointfor preventative vaccine trials, as most infections are transient.Therefore, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) of moderate or high grade are being used as the primary endpoint for vaccine trials. Once this surrogate endpointhas been proven, virological or immunological correlates ofprotection may be considered for future evaluation and productdevelopment.
The most important clinical value of HPV testing in the lowergenital tract is to distinguish women at very low risk ofmalignancy from those at some risk.
In cervical screening, the principal roles that HPV testing mayplay arein primary screening,in following up the treatment of cervical abnormalities,triage of mild abnormalities.

in following up the treatment of cervical abnormalities,
triage of mild abnormalities.
The ASCUC-LSIL triage study (ALTS) investigated the sensitivity ofHPV testing using HC II combined with repeat cytology in detectingCIN3+ lesions (Table 1) [11].
Further results from the ALTS study, in which 897 cases oflow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)and 1193 cases of HPV DNA-positive ASCUS were followed for 2years, suggested that LSIL lesions and HPV-positive ASCUS areclinically equivalent [12]. Initial colposcopic detection ofobviously prevalent CIN2+ reduces risk. However, for theremaining women who have CIN ≤ 1 on colposcopy and directedbiopsy, the risk for subsequent CIN grade 2 or 3 is approximately12% over 2 years.
The HPV in addition to routine testing (HART) study looked at themanagement of women who tested positive for high-risk types ofHPV, but had negative or borderline screening abnormalities[13]. HPV testing was more sensitive than borderline-or-worsecytology (97.1% versus 76.6%, P = .002), but lessspecific (93.3% versus 95.8%, P < .0001) for detecting CIN2+. Surveillance at 12 months was as effective for monitoringprogression as immediate colposcopy.
A meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of HPV DNA testing as analternative to repeat cytology in women who had equivocal resultson a previous Pap smear suggests that HC II assay has highersensitivity and similar specificity than the repeat Pap smear(ASCUS as threshold) for CIN2+ among women in this patient group[14].
HPV testing has a high negative predictive value and although thepositive predictive value is lower, it offers considerablebenefits in triaging patients. It can also assist decision makingon behalf of women with mild cytological abnormalities.
The objectives for reviewing HPV screening trials were todetermine the age-specific HPV prevalencein different European areas,evaluate the sensitivity and specificityof HPV testing in women attending routine screening,compare the sensitivity and specificityof HPV testing with that of routine cytology.
determine the age-specific HPV prevalencein different European areas,

Studies included were from the UK (HART [13], Hammersmith[16]); France (Reims [17]); Germany (Hannover andTuebingen [18], Jena [19]); and the Netherlands(Amsterdam [20]) (Figure 1).
Comparisons were also made with North American screening studiesreported by Ratnam et al [21] andKulasingam et al [22].
Across the European studies, the HC II test for HPV had asensitivity of 96% and specificity of 92%, whereas cytologybased on Pap smears had a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of96%.
Although the performance of HPV testing is similar in differentareas of Europe, the sensitivity of cytology is highly variablebetween countries.
There are a number of potential advantages in using HPV testing(HC II) as the sole primary screening test for cervical cancer.Due to its automated, highly sensitive, and objective nature,results are less variable and quality control is simpler. Cytologycould thus be reserved for 6–10% of women; screening would beundertaken in more detail by a smaller number of more focusedcyto-screeners. Triage of HPV-negative ASCUS/LSIL lesions would beeliminated.
Screening intervals could be longer with potential cost savingsand greater convenience.
A 2001 Cochrane report suggests there is no overwhelminglysuperior surgical technique for eradicating CIN [23].
Regardless of treatment approach, the risk of persistent diseaseis greater when the lesion is large, or the patient is > 30 yearsof age or has been treated previously and/or is a carrier of HPVtypes 16 or 18 [24].
Between 1998 and mid-2003, 3647 women were treated at Melbourne'sRoyal Women's Hospital (RWH) for CIN.
Among those who returned 3–6 months postsurgery, 21% returnedan abnormal Pap smear/histology. By 9–14 months, persistentlow-grade abnormality was seen in 9.4% and high-gradeabnormality in 0.7% of women.
Residual disease following large loop excision of the transformation zone(LLETZ) surgery may be missed in screening when cytology is used.In a 2002 review of 90 women, cytology had a positive predictivevalue of 81.3% and a negative predictive value of 55.4%[25].
Results from RWH comparing cytology and colposcopy for detectingSIL post-operatively suggest that cytology is more specific thancolposcopy (82.6% versus 24.4%), but far less sensitive(46.0% versus 90.5%).
As cytology and colposcopy both present difficulties insensitivity and specificity, HPV testing may provide analternative approach. A review of 11 studies published from 1992to 2002 demonstrated that among 900 women treated for CIN, 204 hadresidual or recurrent cellular abnormalities and incidence of HPVwas 83%; among 696 women with apparently successful outcomes,the incidence of HPV DNA was only 15% [26].
A meta-analysis of 11 studies suggests that the combination of HPVtesting with cytology is promising for post-treatment evaluation[27].
A study currently underway at RWH aims to determine whether HPVDNA (HPV HC II test) is a marker for recurrent disease followingsurgical management of CIN. Since 2001, over 1500 women have beenrecruited at the time of surgical treatment for CIN. Overall,64% of the women had high-risk HPV detected at surgery.  Forwomen with HSIL confirmed histologically at surgery, 79% hadhigh-risk HPV DNA detected on the hybrid capture test.
These women are reviewed regularly and at each visit Pap and HC IItests are undertaken and colposcopy performed.
The overall positive rate for high-risk HPV DNA fell from 31%at 3–9 months to 20% by 21–25 months post-treatment. If Papcytology and HC II were negative 12 months after treatment, only0.6% of women had HSIL.
This study is still ongoing, although these preliminary resultssuggest that the negative predictive value of high-risk HPV DNAholds promise as a marker for the adequacy of HSIL treatment whenperformed ≥ 12 months post-surgery.
Revised guidelines for post-treatment assessment of cervicallesions will be introduced in Australia in July 2006. Colposcopyand cytology should be undertaken 4–6 months after treatment forHSIL. Cervical cytology and HPV typing will be used at 12 months,then annually until negative results for both tests are obtainedon 2 consecutive occasions. From that time on, Pap smears willthen be at the recommended screening interval of 2 yearly.
In Singapore, cancer causes more deaths than heart disease[28]. Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer inSingapore, and based on 1993–1998 data, has an ASR of14.3/100 000. Breast, lung, colorectal cancers, and, in recentyears, ovarian cancers, have a higher incidence [29]. Breast,colorectal, and ovarian cancer rates are increasing; lung andcervical cancer are decreasing, a trend believed to be linked tobehavioural factors [29].
Current cervical screening recommendations in Singapore recommendPap smears every 3 years for women from time of first intercourseor from 25 years of age until 65 years. A cervical screeningprogramme for Singapore was first proposed in 1992; however,breast screening was given priority. In 1997, a plan for a pilotstudy was submitted and accepted by the Health Promotion Board.Following 5 years of development, the pilot programme is currentlyunderway. Roll-out nationally had begun in 2004.
Short-term challenges for the project are toensure coverage across the population, through education ofdoctors and womenprepare laboratories and standardise reporting—a localsystematic reporting system has been adopted,effectively manage and treat women with abnormal smears,address the issue of false-negative Pap smear results.Past failures of cervical screening [30] attributable to lackof adequate quality control, rather than to technologicallimitations of the Pap test, has shifted the focus from newtechnology (such as automation) [31] toward qualityassurance [32]. Retrospective review has highlighted areasfor laboratory education and quality improvement efforts, andstrong liability concerns have prompted the introduction ofgovernmental regulation of laboratories, including obligatoryaccreditation.

HPV vaccination has the potential to become the secondprophylactic vaccine capable of reducing the incidence of cancer,following the success of hepatitis B vaccine in reducinghepatocellular carcinoma in some areas of the world [33].
Two vaccines for HPV are currently in late-stage development.However, decisions on vaccine types, efficacy, and usage will awaitthe outcomes of trials currently underway, such as the FUTURE IIstudy of a quadrivalent vaccine in young women in the USA andBrazil, and the testing of a bivalent vaccine by theGlaxoSmithKline HPV Vaccine Study Group.
As a primary prevention, vaccination offers the advantage of beingable to be administered without specific training. In thelong-term, vaccination against oncogenic HPV should reduce theincidence of persistent infection and subsequently of cervicalcancer mortality. As part of a screening programme, the role andcost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccines will be influenced byage at the time of vaccination, level and duration ofimmunoprotection, epidemiology of local HPV types, and cost of thevaccine [34]. In Asia, while squamous cell cancer is mostfrequently associated with HPVs 16 and 18, which are predominantin most countries of the world, there is some evidence that HPV 52and 58 are more prevalent [35].
Considerations for planners includeuncertainty about the role and response of antigenic HPV subtypesin cervical cancer causation,the impact vaccination will have on frequenciesof nontargeted HPV types,the need to vaccinate men as well as women.The impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer incidence wouldnot be immediate. If vaccination of young girls begins in 2010, itwould be almost 20 years before the decline of CIN and cancerincidence may become apparent, in 2030.

Singapore plans to implement universal Pap smearing from 2006; inlight of the current breakthroughs, a strange irony has emerged.While the implementation of a national cervical cancer screeningprogramme brings the exciting prospect of controlling a largelypreventable cancer, the country must still face the costly processof preventing misdiagnosis due to the less-than-perfectsensitivity and specificity of the screening Pap test. The use ofHPV testing and vaccination holds significant promise, but willnot eliminate the need for Singapore to address quality control inPap smear collection, cytology, and reporting [36].
Preliminary results suggest that vaccines may also havetherapeutic benefits in women showing precancerous CIN lesions[37, 38]. It appears that vaccines may stimulate the immunesystem and cause the regression of precancerous CIN 1, CIN 2, andCIN 3 lesions when given locally.
In planning a cancer screening programme, each country willdevelop guidelines based on the best available estimates of costs,benefits, and risks. Guidelines can be reviewed in light ofemerging evidence as well as new diagnostic and treatment options.
Evaluation of a programme's coverage should consider the age ofeligible participants, the frequency of testing, and communityawareness of, and access to, the programme. All will impact oncost and effectiveness.
Recommendations on the age of initiation and frequency of cervicalscreening vary between European countries. Van Ballegooijenet al compared the relative cost-effectiveness of programmes inEuropean countries based on recommended screening age ranges andintervals and coverage (Table 2) [39].
Sasieni et al used UK data to compare the incidence of cervicalcancer in different age groups of women against the number ofyears since their last negative screening result [40]. His findings revealed that less frequent screening may confer greateradvantages in older women (> 40 years) compared with youngerwomen. He found that 5-yearly screening offersconsiderable protection (83%) against cancer at ages 55–69years; annual screening provides only modest additional protection(87%). On this basis the cervical screening programme nowoffers 3-yearly and 5-yearly screening for women aged 25–50 and50–64 years, respectively.
The proportion of women in the community who are screened at therecommended frequency will also influence any evaluation. In 2004,around four in every five British women aged 25–64 years had beenscreened for cervical cancer within the previous 5 years.
Primary care practices carry the prime responsibility for thecontinuity of testing. A review of primary care organisations in2004 showed that coverage of eligible women in different practicesvaried from 70% to 90%.
Training and evaluation programmes in cytology and colposcopy havebeen established. The majority of British laboratories reviewed in2003–2004 achieved 65–85% positive predictive values in theirreviews of cervical smears (the proportion of high-grade cytologyassociated with underlying high grade CIN).
National computerised colposcopy data is not routinely collected;for example in 2003–2004, more than 70% of women with abnormalscreening results saw a specialist for colposcopy within 8 weeks.This was followed by a diagnostic biopsy in 40% of cases, and19% had lesions excised on that first visit. In 37% ofreferred patients, colposcopy appeared normal and no procedure wasrequired.
New options such as HPV DNA testing, the availability ofliquid-based cytology and a growing awareness of the relativelysmall benefits gained through frequent testing for women < 40years of age, are likely to influence the evolution of the Britishscreening programme.
In the Philippines, cervical cancer is the second most commoncancer among women, behind breast cancer [41]. The age standardised rate (ASR) is estimated to be 22.5/100 000.Incidence rises sharply in women > 35 years of age. More than7000 new cases and almost 4000 deaths are seen each year.
There is a close link between neoplastic cervical changes and HPVpersistence. Of 356 cases of SCC or ADC, 93.5% testedpositive for HPV, compared with only 9.1% among a controlgroup [42]. HPV types 16 and 18 were most frequentlyassociated with cervical cancer.
As two in every three cases of cervical cancer are detected inlate stages of the disease, the median survival rate afterdiagnosis is only 76 months; 5-year survival is 51.7%.
The Philippine health infrastructure is not sufficiently developedto support a well-structured, cytology-based screening programme.Pap smears are available through family planning clinics andrelevant societies; however, screening is not coordinated orappropriately targeted. Alternative strategies for lowering thecervical cancer disease burden must be considered.
The Department of Health and the Medical Faculty at the Universityof the Philippines reviewed screening options to identify anapproach that is feasible, cost-effective, and replicable, toreduce the need for extensive cytology services and radical formsof treatment.
The study focused onknowledge, attitude, practice, and behavioural modification,validity and reliability standards for the screening test,cost-effectiveness,health policy implications.Four approaches to screening were compared:unaided acetic acid visualisation (AA),magnified acetic acid visualisation (MAA),Pap smear using spatula (S),Pap smear using cervical brush (CB).Women 25–65 years of age were recruited for the study and ofthose screened and interviewed, 13 105 underwent colposcopy andwere included in the data analysis.

The results demonstrated the potential for acetic acidvisualisation in a screening process (Table 3).
As a result of this trial, the study group recommended thatthe acetic acid aided visual method be used as the initialscreen for cervical epithelial abnormalities at health centreswhere Pap smear is not available,all women showing abnormalities be referred for colposcopy,and biopsy, if necessary.Screening coverage for Filipino women is still low due toinadequate healthcare personnel and a shortage of facilities.There has been no sustained public health campaign topromote the benefits of regular screening. With many otherpressing public health priorities in the Philippines, funding forcervical screening is limited.

Cervical cancer is the most common neoplasm in Indian women, with126 000 new cases and 70 000 deaths each year. Incidence ishigher than in Eastern Asia [1].
Across India, AARs vary greatly from ∼ 55/100 000 inAmbillikai to < 18 in Mumbai and Trivandrum [43]. AcrossIndia, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer reported from allcancer registries except those in Mumbai and Delhi, where breastcancer is the commonest.
Persistent infection with HPV has been linked to almost all casesof cervical cancer and 73–85% of CIN [44, 45].
In India, most studies previously focused on the prevalence ofHPVs 16 and 18 in the general population, which was reported to be7.5–9.6%—lower than global estimates—but recentstudies by IARC that looked at all high-risk types have reportedprevalence rates of 14–19%.  Among Indian women withCIN, 73% tested positive for HPV [46]. Types 16 or 18 were present in 73–82% of cervical cancer. However, asystematic study for all HPV types found 99.5% of tumours tobe positive for HPV [47]. In another study from the All IndiaInstitute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), 98.1% of tumours werepositive for HPV. The most common types in these two studies wereHPVs 16, 18, 33, and 45.
The highest prevalence of HPV infection was previously reported tobe between 21–24 years of age, but more recently, a systematicIARC study has shown that there is no distinct age-related peakfor HPV prevalence (Figure 2) [48].
In a 2005 survey of HPV genotypes at the AIIMS in New Delhi, HPV16 was by far the most prevalent type, detected in more than35%, while HPV 18 prevalence was ∼3%.
The National Cancer Control Program has operated since1972. Although cervical cancer is a stated priority, there hasbeen no coordinated cytology screening.
The current recommendation of the Indian Council of MedicalResearch is that all women should have a single Pap smear atapproximately 35 years of age. In reality, screening isopportunistic, frequently in research settings.
Developing countries must rely on less sophisticated resources,such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), visualinspection with acetic acid magnification (VIAM), or visualinspection with Lugol's iodine (VILI).
A series of trials has evaluated the efficacy of these approachesin detecting high-grade disease. Results have been very variable,with VIA having a sensitivity of 55 [49]–88% [50, 51] and specificity of 63 [51]–94% [52]. Comparisonsbetween combinations of VIA, VIAM, and VILI have been reported byBasu et al [49], Sankaranarayanan et al [53], the IARC[54], and Shastri et al [55] with variable results.
In screening for cervical cancer, VIA offers the followingadvantages over alternatives:simple, easy-to-learn approach,low startup and ongoing costs,less reliance on infrastructure or medicalspecialists to perform procedure,immediacy of results,potential for integration into primary health care services.

In detecting high-grade cervical lesions, the role of HPV testingremains unclear. The test could be undertaken usingsamples collected by the patient. In a recent trial byAIIMS, 93.5% of participants provided a satisfactoryself-sample, and concordance between physician-collected andself-samples was high (93.8%).
HPV testing can be automated and provides a standardised,objective result. In combination, it can improve the sensitivityof Pap smears and VIA.
However, major problems for the widespread adoption of HPV testingin India are its cost, the need for sophisticated laboratoryinfrastructure, and repeat visits.
Newer technologies may increase the specificity of testing withoutloss of sensitivity, but are currently too costly for generalisedadoption.
Point-of-care diagnostic tests such as VIA and the “rapid” HPVtest will benefit populations with poor compliance.
Mortality data from the 1970s to the 1990s suggest that Chinasuffers relatively high cervical cancer mortality, particularly inthe rural mid-west. Wudu in Gansu province and Yangcheng in Shanxihad age-adjusted mortality rates of > 40/100 000 in 1990–1992.
Better diagnosis and treatment have reduced deaths from cervicalcancer, but the improvement is not uniform and mortality rates areunchanged in some counties.
There are no national screening programmes for cancer in China. Inthe case of cervical cancer, limitations include the nationwideshortage of cytologists.
In late 2003, a national cancer prevention and control strategywas finalised and endorsed by the Ministry of Health, followingconsensus meetings for early detection and treatment across ninecancer types.
Two demonstration centres for cervical cancer prevention andcontrol have been established in Shenzhen (South-East China) forhigh resources settings and Xiangyuan (North-West China) for lowresources settings [56]. A government recommendation that allwomen should have at least one screen between 35 and 65 years ofage is still pending.
The first Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study (SPOCCSI) included 1997 women who underwent a cervical evaluation usingHPV self-test, optical biopsy, liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep),VIA, direct testing for HPV, or colposcopy with biopsy [57].
A second study (SPOCCS II) included > 8000 women who submitted aself-sample for HPV at their village and subsequently visited theclinic for HPV Direct Test, LBC (AutoCyte), and VIA [58]. Those with abnormalities (n = 3252) underwent colposcopy andbiopsy. Women with CIN 2+ lesions were treated; those with CIN 1lesions will be followed up in 12 months.
In both studies, women with cervical cancer or CIN 2+ lesions onbiopsy were likely to be infected with HPV (> 95%). Even forwomen with CIN 1 lesions, the attributable risk of HPV is as highas 95%. The incidence of HPV among women with normal biopsieswas < 15%.
Persistent HPV infection was higher among women aged 50–54 yearsthan younger women in Shanxi, but there were marked differences inthe age-related curves for women in rural areas versus cities.
Extensive lifestyle data were collected covering sexual history,child bearing, occupation, health, bathing practices, age atmenarche and menopause, education, and income.
Lifestyle had a significant effect on HPV and cervical cancerprevalence in Shanxi. Risk factors that appeared to contribute tothe likelihood of cervical cancer were subject promiscuity (OR= 1.42); husband's promiscuity (1.42); bathing at a publichouse (1.23); postmenopause (1.22); and current smoking(1.17). Surprisingly, education appeared to slightly raise thelikelihood of HPV.
When self-testing was compared with direct testing for HPV,specificity for CIN 2+ was identical (85.9%), whilesensitivity was higher on direct testing (97.6%) than forself-testing (83.5%).
In both trials, each screening test was compared with pathology todetermine accuracy in detecting moderate-high-grade lesions (Table 4).
With high sensitivity (> 96%) and moderate specificity(86%), the HPV direct test could be used as a primary screeningtest for cervical cancer risk. Self-sampling is simple and lessexpensive; however, improvements in instructional leaflets will beneeded.
Combined HPV and VIA offers potential for screening in themid-west regions of China, but for consistent results, VIAtraining will be essential.
Hong Kong has a population of 6.8 million. Life expectancy for women at birth was estimated to be 84.3 years in 2003.
During the period 1988–1992, Hong Kong's ASR for cervical cancer was ∼17; this is lower than that of the Thai, Korean, Filipino, and Singaporean-Chinese populations, but higher than in Japan (Figure 3) [59].
Until 2004, there was no centrally organised, systematic cervicalscreening programme (CSP) in Hong Kong. Screening was generallyopportunistic or included as part of a general checkup. Screeningpractices varied between different healthcare providers and therewas little collaboration between public and private sectorhealthcare.
Approximately 45% of women, primarily those who were educatedand health-conscious, were being screened. This somewhat randomcoverage was not equitable or efficient, and was unlikely to becost-effective.
Despite this, the ASR for cervical cancer declined steadilybetween 1983 and 2000, the most significant fall being among women50–65 years of age. About 50% of cases are diagnosed at stage1.
First approved in 2001, the Hong Kong CSP was launched in March2004. The goal is to reduce the incidence of, and mortality from,cervical cancer by facilitating regular screening for all patientsat risk.
Stated objectives are toraise public awareness,improve population coverage,promote more equitable and efficient screening,build quality assurance into the services throughprofessional education and clear guidelines,support private sector activity.Following statistical modelling, the target population was set toinclude all women 25–64 years of age who have had sex. After twoclear annual checks, screening will be scheduled every 3 years,and discontinued at 65 years if the previous Pap smears arenormal.
raise public awareness,
improve population coverage,
promote more equitable and efficient screening,
build quality assurance into the services throughprofessional education and clear guidelines,
support private sector activity.
Using triennial screens, it was estimated that if coverage raisedto 80% of the population, there would be ∼75%decrease in the number of cases of cervical cancer.
It is hoped that the CSP will increase coverage from 43% to60% within 3 years, and to 80–85% in the long term.
During the period March 2004–June 2005, almost 150 000 womenwere enrolled in the CSP. Based on age quintiles, enrolment has beenhighest among women 40–44 years of age. There are large variationsbetween districts.
The CSP incorporates a centralised information system with awebsite (available athttp://www.csis.gov.hk) accommodating the input of data online.
The central registry will include screening results, followupinvestigations, and demographic data, and will generate reminderletters to women due for screening. Practitioners will be emaileddetails of patients recalled, and alerted to abnormal smears. Thesystem will also provide data for ongoing evaluation andmonitoring.
Public education regarding cervical cancer has not been a priorityin Hong Kong; therefore, communication and promotion arepriorities. Attention was drawn to the disease when Anita Mui, apopular singer and movie star, died from cervical cancer inDecember 2003. She was 40 years of age. Her death coincided withthe launch of the CSP and may have aided receptivity.
All registered doctors and trained nurses may collect cervicalsmears. Accreditation for participation is coordinated by theSociety for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. Healthprofessionals whose smears do not meet CSP minimum standards willbe invited to attend refresher training.
Healthcare professionals who supply smears to the CSP are providedwith a training kit, which covers technical skills andcommunication approaches.
A survey of women will be undertaken to gauge levels ofsatisfaction with the CSP and the Pap smear.
The Hong Kong College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (HKCOG)has developed guidelines for the taking of Pap smears andmanagement of abnormal smears [60]. Other referenceguidelines for pathology [61] and cytology [62] havealso been prepared.
Cervical cytology laboratories operating under the CSP must beapproved by international bodies and the Hong Kong laboratoryaccreditation scheme.
The CSP uses Pap smear cytology as the primary screen.
Among smears undertaken to date, 5.6% have shown epithelialcell abnormalities. Of the abnormal smears, 60–80% wererecorded as ASCUS. ASCUS patients were either referred forcolposcopy or followed up with a further screen. However, only2–10% of ASCUS patients have serious disease [63].
HPV testing is currently under consideration as a means oftriaging patients with ASCUS and low-grade lesions.
A trial was undertaken where ASCUS smears were repeated (n =5579); on second review, 9.8% and 1.7% showed LSIL andHSIL lesions, respectively [64]. Patients with a primaryASCUS smear are at greater risk of developing SIL and should befollowed up.
A study of patients with ASCUS smears checked HPV status using HCII testing. To date, 2309 samples have been screened. Almost half(47.9%) were positive for high-risk HPV strains. HPV-positivewomen with ASCUS were more likely to have HSIL (P = .001) andLSIL (P < .0001) detected in their next cervical cytologysamples.
Despite its benefits, HPV typing remains expensive. In addition,anxiety is generated when a woman is told that she has beenexposed to the virus. To ensure that information is communicatedeffectively to patients, it is important that incorrectconclusions are avoided. For example, having been told thatcervical cancer is caused by HPV, an STD, patients should notconclude that cervical cancer is an STD. Similarly, althoughsexual promiscuity increases the risk of HPV and cervical cancer,an HPV-positive test does not imply that a woman has beenpromiscuous. These communication challenges mean that HPV may notbe an acceptable primary screening test.
This project aims to detect precancerous cervical lesions usingnewly developed rapid biochemical tests that are affordable,accurate, simple to use, and appropriate forlow-resource settings.
PATH is currently working on two promising candidates:batch test (46 samples) for use in a small clinicor mobile unit (results in ∼2 hours) in collaborationwith Digene Corporation (USA),rapid strip test for a near-patientsetting (results in less than 20 minutes) in collaboration withArbor Vita Corporation (USA).Following three years of research and development on the newtests, the goal is to have a prototype for testing (verification,validation, field tests) in 2006 and 2007. PATH has negotiated anagreement with each private-sector partner to supply the tests ata preferential price to the public sector in developing countriesfor a period of ten years.
batch test (46 samples) for use in a small clinicor mobile unit (results in ∼2 hours) in collaborationwith Digene Corporation (USA),
rapid strip test for a near-patientsetting (results in less than 20 minutes) in collaboration withArbor Vita Corporation (USA).
The rapid batch test developed by Digene Corporation will use aninstant photo signal output. Images of samples will be comparedvisually on a film with positive and negative controls.
The rapid strip test promises to differentiate betweentransformation and infection by HPV. Arbor Vita Corporationtechnology detects a biomarker (E6 oncoprotein) which correlateswith neoplastic transformation of cells and maintenance ofcervical cancer. The ELISA prototype is now being adapted to animmunochromatographic strip format capable of detecting commonhigh-risk HPV types. Efforts are focused on improving sensitivity.
In addition to using a cervical sample obtained by a health careprovider, vaginal sampling by a woman herself or a provider isbeing investigated for both assays.
Clinical work will be undertaken in China (Cancer InstituteChinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, will coordinateevaluation across several provinces) and India (Tata MemorialHospital, Mumbai, will oversee testing in the state ofMaharashtra).
Participation in the project offers benefits for thecollaborating countries:approximately 22 000 rural women will be screened for cervicalcancer and treated, if necessary;the project will provide job opportunities in outlying districts;biomedical workers will have opportunities for intellectualexchange;improved tests should provide a more affordable,accessible, and acceptable screening option. Better populationcoverage would lower disease incidence and mortality.

HPV DNA testing has an estimated sensitivity of 96% andspecificity of 92%, making it considerably more sensitive andonly marginally less specific than cytology. There is sufficientevidence based on surrogate markers that the efficacy of HPVtesting, using a validated system, as the primary screeningmodality can be expected to be at least as good as that ofconventional cytology [68].
HPV testing offers a number of advantages when used in combinationwith cytology in primary screening:higher sensitivity,longer screening interval,fewer inadequate samples.If HPV testing were the sole primary screening test, cytologycould be used to triage patients who test positive. Self-samplingmay improve coverage.
higher sensitivity,
longer screening interval,
fewer inadequate samples.
Cost reductions would result from longer screening intervals,fewer inadequate smears, and avoidance of borderline smears inwomen not infected with HPV. However, lab costs would be higherand surveillance rates would rise.
The cost impact of adding HPV testing to the British cervicalscreening programme, and increasing the screening interval from 3to 5 years, was estimated in 1998 [69]. The result suggesteda fall in costs of around £30 million, or almost 25%.
A vaccine protecting against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 isexpected to substantially reduce the burden of HPV-relateddiseases.
Merck's quadrivalent HPV L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine,GARDASIL, has been well tolerated, immunogenic, and effectiveagainst HPV infection in early studies. Phase III studies areunderway to definitively evaluate the clinical and public healthimpact of GARDASIL in adolescent and adult men and women (Table 5).
The quadrivalent vaccine comprises VLPs produced in a recombinantyeast [70]. The vaccine is adsorbed on the Merck proprietaryaluminium adjuvant, which strengthens its immunogenicity.
Injection volume is 0.5 mL. Boosters are given at 2 and 6months.
The three-phase development programme is moving towardscompletion.Phases I and IIa: preliminary assessment ofimmunogenicity and tolerability of different doses of monovalentHPV L1 VLP vaccines.Phase IIb: immunogenicity and tolerability ofdifferent quadrivalent vaccine dose formulations.Phase III: demonstration of risk reductionfor acquisition of HPV infection and development of genital wartsand CIN 2/3 related to HPV types.

HPV 16 vaccine proof-of-principle study
This early stage trial was double blind and placebo controlled[9]. Erolment involved 2391 US women aged 16–23 years,regardless of HPV status, who were followed for 4 years. Efficacyevaluation considered only women who were HPV 16-naïve atbaseline.
The primary endpoint of the study was persistent HPV 16 infection(positive vaginal or cervical swabs on ≥ 2 consecutivevisits), or HPV 16-related CIN (low-grade or high-grade precanceron a tissue specimen from an abnormal area on the cervix ANDdetection of HPV 16 virus in the same lesion), with an additionalcorollary endpoint of single HPV 16 detection at last visit onrecord.
After 4 years, among those vaccinated there were seven instancesof HPV detection or CIN, compared with 111 cases among the placebogroup. This data demonstrate an efficacy level of 94%(P = 10−12). Significantly, all seven cases in the vaccine group were of single HPV detection at last visit on record. Theadverse event profiles were similar in the vaccine and placebogroups.
In tests undertaken at 7 months, all vaccinated women hadsignificantly higher levels of specific serum antibodies thanthose on placebo, including those naturally infected [71].
Dose-ranging and efficacy study
More than 1100 women aged 16–23 years, from the USA, Brazil, andthe EU, were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlledstudy, and followed for 3 years [70].
Three formulations of quadrivalent HPV vaccine or placebo weregiven at enrolment, 2 months and 6 months.
Immunogenicity was reviewed against each viral type and women weremonitored for persistent HPV in cervical samples, CIN+ lesions,and genital warts.
Antibody response proved similar with the three vaccineformulations, and all women given the vaccine had antibody titresgreater than those seen following natural infection.
The lowest dose combination has become the standard formulationfor GARDASIL.
Overall, four vaccinated women had persistent HPV infections (HPV16, 18), compared with 36 women given a placebo vaccine. Efficacywas 90% (P < 10−3).
Adolescent immunogenicity substudy
If HPV vaccine is to be used prior to sexual debut, an adequateimmune response must be demonstrated in adolescents.
A randomised, double-blind, multicentre study has been undertakento compare immunogenicity, seroconversion, and safety in10–15-year-old males and females, and 16–23-year-old females.
In all test groups, seroconversion levels at 7 months were higherthan the results recorded in the earlier adult trial.
Phase III
Phase III studies will include ∼ 20 000 female patientsat 150 sites across 33 ethnically diverse countries. Followupwill be for 4 years from first dose.
The study in women began in 2001. A separate series of studieswill be conducted to evaluate the vaccine's efficacy in men(heterosexual and homosexual). Men are a vector for HPV in women,and suffer from genital warts and anal cancer (AIN is increasingamong gay men).
The studies are characterised by an inclusive centralisedcervicovaginal evaluation programme. Women undergo Pap testing at6–12 month intervals.
Prophylactic vaccines are the most efficient means to reduce theclinical impact of infectious disease. If proven safe andeffective, a quadrivalent vaccine targeting pathogenic HPV typeswill greatly reduce the burden of HPV-related diseases.
Preliminary studies for GARDASIL are promising, but the Phase IIIprogramme will provide a definitive assessment of the clinicalutility of the vaccine.
HPV types 16 and 18 are most frequently associated with cervicalcancer, occurring in > 70% cases globally [72].
In some locations (the Philippines, Costa Rica, Bangkok), the oddsratio associating HPV and cervical cancer is > 10 times that ofcigarette smoking and lung cancer [73].
The objective for vaccine development was to prevent persistentinfection with HPV 16/18, and thus avoid abnormal cytological andneoplastic changes in the cervix.
GlaxoSmithKline has produced an HPV vaccine based on a recombinantL1 protein, which self-assembles into VLPs. These resemble intactviruses but are not infectious. The vaccine, currently in clinicaltrials, is the result of an early-stage collaboration betweenMedImmune and GSK.
Originally, the vaccine was produced using an aluminium adjuvant,but in Phase II trials a new adjuvant (AS04) generated faster,stronger, and longer-lasting antibody responses against both HPVtypes. Seroconversion remained at 100% for 24 months. Thedifference between the earlier aluminium adjuvant and AS04 wasstatistically significant.
All formulations and dosage levels tested in early trials werewell-tolerated, although local injection site reactions werecommon. Vaccination generated high levels of HPV16/18-neutralising antibodies and CMI responses, particularly theformulations using the AS04 adjuvant.
The first efficacy trial, a double-blind, controlled, randomisedtrial, was conducted in the USA, Canada, and Brazil. More than1100 women were enrolled; they were aged 15–25 years, claimed nomore than six lifetime partners, and were seronegative for HPV16/18 and tested negative for HR-HPV DNA in cervical scrapes.
The vaccine schedule included three doses (0, 1, and 6 months) andparticipants were monitored for 18 months.
The objectives were toevaluate efficacy against incident HPV 16 and/or18 infection,evaluate efficacy against persistent HPV 16 and/or18 infection and the development of HPV 16- and/or 18-associatedcytologic and histologic lesions,determine vaccine safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.At 7 months, all vaccinated women showed ELISA responses that farexceeded those seen in naturally infected women. No instances ofpersistent infection were recorded in vaccinated women [74].

evaluate efficacy against persistent HPV 16 and/or18 infection and the development of HPV 16- and/or 18-associatedcytologic and histologic lesions,
determine vaccine safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.
In the vaccine group, there was also statistically significantprotection against HPV 31, 52, and 45. Types 31 and 52 arephylogenetically related to HPV 16, as HPV 45 is to HPV 18, yetthis was the first evidence of cross-protection between HPV types.The GSK vaccine provides protection against high-risk HPV types inaddition to HPV 16/18. Cross-protection increases vaccine coverageagainst cervical cancer [72].
A large Phase III efficacy study will enrol 18 000 women, 15–25years of age in 14 different countries across four global regions.It will be a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial over 4years, with Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)oversight. Cervical samples for PCR and cytology will be takenevery 6 months for 4 years. The objective is to gauge thevaccine's efficacy in preventing CIN2+, AIS, and invasivecervical cancer resulting from persistent infection with HPV16/18.
The National Cancer Institute will undertake a separate study thatwill test ∼12 000 women through a single centre inCosta Rica. Data management will be overseen by an IDMC.
The programme also includes studies that will extend vaccinationage coverage to 10–55 years. Key data is accumulating to supportfiling for launch in 2006.
Long-term studies to evaluate the vaccine's efficacy againstcervical cancer are planned until 2015.
The only approach to preventing the consequences of persistent HPVinfection currently widely available involves treatment followingearly detection of CIN. This requires regular screening using Papsmears, visual inspection, and/or HPV testing, followed bydestructive therapy to kill cancerous cells.
Prophylactic vaccines now in development use VLPs to preventinfection with specific HPV types.
It may be possible to use viral nonstructural proteins to promotethe immune response and enhance resolution of precancerous andearly cancer lesions.
There is considerable research interest in HPV therapeutic vaccinedevelopment. During the next 25 years, 5 million women who arealready infected with HPV will develop cervical cancer. Vaccineshave been developed which appear to work in mice and areimmunogenic in humans, but none has reliably halted or reversedcancer progression.
HPV is a nonlytic virus that does not generate local inflammation.The immune response is certainly weaker compared with most otherpathogenic viruses.
However, infected cells carry several viral proteins capable ofsignalling the presence of HPV. The immune system recognises apeptide of 8–10 amino acids on the infected cell surface.
CSL has an experimental therapeutic product, CerVax 16, which usesE6/E7 proteins identical to those of HPV16 and a quillaiasaponin-based adjuvant capable of promoting both humoral andcell-mediated immunity [75].
The vaccine has been trialled in a double-blind, dose-escalationstudy that was stratified by HPV16 status. Participants were 31women with HSIL smears and, in most cases, CIN3 lesions.
Vaccination induced an E7 specific DTH response andthere was a fall in viral load post-vaccination. Anti-E7 antibody developed in all vaccinated subjects and most demonstrated anti-E7-specific T helper cell responses. However,during 12 weeks' followup, there was no change in colposcopy andhistology. The women were referred for standard treatment.
An HPV6b VLP vaccine has been trialled in Zhejiang province, China[76]. Women with recurrent genital warts were treated withthree doses of VLPs administered at 4 weekly intervals. There wasa DTH response at the injection site and a rise in HPV6-specificantibodies. Ten weeks after first immunisation, only 40% ofpatients still had unresolved warts. A randomised,placebo-controlled study of VLP vaccine as therapy for warts iswarranted.
By 2004, 12 human studies of HPV immunotherapy had been published.In all but one study, the antigen was derived from an E6/E7 fusionprotein, but the target diseases varied (genital warts[76, 77], anal/cervical dysplasia [78], cervical cancer,[75, 79–82] VIN [83–85]). Although the vaccineshave proven to be well-tolerated and immunogenic, diseaseregression has been very inconsistent. Some developmental productshave been named, and are listed here to aid recognition: Xenova(HPV 16); Stressgen (HPV 16); Zycos (HPV 16).
Grafting and transplanting tumours in animals has demonstratedthat effective epithelial immunotherapy requireseffector CD4 and CD8 T-cells,IFN-γ, but not Perforin or FasL,an adequate “magnitude of response,”local inflammation, even when an effectivecellular immune response is induced.

Therapeutic vaccines to combat HPV infection are at least a decadeaway. They appear unlikely to be effective as sole therapy forHPV-associated tumours. Enhancing innate immunity may prove to beas important as generating antigen-specific responses.
Cytology is unfeasible for much of the developing world due to itscost, inadequate infrastructure and levels of expertise, and thevery high level of inflammatory smears (false-positives). In anexample from Recife, Brazil, in 1991, ∼ 63 000 women werescreened using Pap smears. The incidence of inflammatory changeswas 71%, compared with 6% of CIN or cancerous lesions. Onlyone in five women recorded “normal” Pap smears.
Because of the long time period over which epithelial dysplasiasdevelop neoplastic tendencies, a programme must operatecontinuously and consistently over time for greatest impact onmortality rates.
The introduction of commercial vaccines will raise many strategicquestions with regard to cervical cancer prophylaxis andmanagement.
There is some debate over which groups to target for vaccination,for example, whether it should be available to all women orrestricted by age or HPV status. Men, who are a reservoir for HPVvirus, may also be considered for vaccination.
While the ultimate goal of HPV vaccination is to reduce cancerdeaths, it will be a long time before that reduction ismeasurable. Success may also be evaluated through levels of HPVinfection, persistence of infection, levels of CIN, or onlyhigh-grade CIN.
The durability of protection needs to be evaluated to determinewhether boosters will be required to maintain immunity followingthe initial series.
Neither of two vaccines currently in development targets all HPVtypes identified as high-risk for cervical cancer. At best, theywould only reduce cancers linked to HPVs 16 and 18 (65–75%). Toachieve 85% protection, a vaccine would need to be immunogenicagainst five different high-risk HPVs, yet the relative importanceof the various HPV strains in cancer causation differs betweenregions [35].
The interpretation of diagnostic HPV tests following theintroduction of the vaccine will be more difficult. Followingvaccination, women would test positive to the HR-HPV screen usedin HC II tests. Over time, there will be a need for tests capableof distinguishing HPV types 16 and 18 from other HPV types linkedto cervical cancer.
Within 1–3 years, the impact of vaccination on CIN2+ should beevident. Proven efficacy against cancer is likely to require 5years, and will probably be seen earliest in the developing world.The effectiveness of vaccination on preventing persistentinfection for the types used remains at 100% [86, 87].
Vaccination will not reduce the need for regular cervicalscreening for at least 10 years, and probably longer, depending onlevels of usage, HPV type distribution within the population, andscreening techniques used.
A review of the role of HPV testing within a cervical screeningprogramme identified “a lack of knowledge about the psychosocialissues involved in providing cervical screening in general and HPVtesting in particular [69].”
Public support for HPV testing and appropriate infrastructure andtechnology will need to be available before testing can becomegeneralised; perhaps more important will be general knowledge andunderstanding.
Of the few studies to examine knowledge of HPV, most have sampledUS university students. Both Ramirez et al [88] and Baer et al [89] reported very low levels of awareness of HPV,particularly its link to cervical cancer.
These studies did not compare HPV knowledge with understanding ofcervical cancer and screening. Consequently, it is difficult toknow whether gaps in the knowledge base are broad or restricted tospecific topics.
Pitts and Clarke conducted a study at a UK university in 2002 toexamine knowledge of HPV in the context of cervical cancer, andunderstanding of the screening process [90].
The sample group of 985 women was 19–64 years of age (mean = 40years). Approximately half worked in clerical or administrativeroles; academics, managers, and manual workers accounted for theremainder.
The GP (64.3%) and practice nurse (50.3%) were the mostfrequently cited sources of information regarding cervical cancer.However, family/friends (30.5%) and magazines/books(29.3%) were also significant.
It was encouraging that when the women were asked what an abnormalsmear might mean, 97% of women mentioned abnormal, precancerouscells; 39% mentioned cancer; and 45% mentioned infection.Less than 1% of women said they did not know.
Two in three women (68%) were aware that a large number ofsexual partners could increase risk, and 60.3% also mentionedearly age of first sexual activity. Smoking (45%) and failureto use condoms (28%) were mentioned by fewer women.
However, only 30% of sampled women were aware of HPV, and amongthe aware minority, knowledge was generally poor (78% incorrector no knowledge). Only 30% of respondents were aware that HPVis a sexually transmitted disease, and consequently very fewparticipants could correctly identify risk factors.
In answer to more specific questions, the majority of respondentsadmitted they “did not know.” For instance, in response to thequestion “if symptomatic, what are the signs and symptoms ofHPV?,” 90% answered incorrectly or left the question blank. Asfor the long-term effects of HPV, only 11% of respondentsdemonstrated good understanding.
To determine what women want to know about HPV, Anhanget al reported on eight ethnically diverse focus groups [91].
The women were provided with background information before thefocus groups met. In discussion, it was evident that womenoverestimated the likelihood that HPV exposure would lead tocancer, and struggled to balance this knowledge with the awarenessthat HPV often regresses without treatment. Consequently, theyfound it difficult to assess personal risk of HPV and cervicalcancer, often failing to understand how a Pap test could be normalin HPV+ women. Younger women focused on sexual transmission of HPVrather than its potential to cause cancer.
Anhang et al paper suggests that without good communication andunderstanding, responses to a diagnosis of HPV could includeanxiety, anger, regret, and fear [91].
Among women who have had a positive HPV test, anxiety about thepotential for cancer has been demonstrated repeatedly. McCaffreyet al found that HPV-positive women were more anxious andconcerned about relationships compared with HPV-negative women[92].
Although there is no evidence specifically related to HPV, thestigma and concern associated with a positive diagnosis for an STDhave been widely reported [93, 94].
In 111 US newspaper stories (1995–2002) on HPV, there was littleinformation regarding prevention, transmission, and symptoms. Onlya minority of stories mentioned risk factors for HPV, stated thatHPV can be asymptomatic, or included the frequency of regressionwithout treatment. In fact, only one in four mentioned that mostHPV+ women do not develop cervical cancer.
A survey in Melbourne, Australia, of 384 well-educated gay menfound little understanding of anal cancer and the role of HPV[95]. More than half of those interviewed had not heard of ananal Pap smear and/or HPV, suggesting a poor sense of personalsusceptibility to HPV disease.
Among those who were aware, the most common source of informationhad been a doctor or other health professional. The resultssuggest that health education for gay men should not be neglected.
There is a clear need for further studies. Few evaluations haveassessed risk perceptions or the likely impact of HPV testing orvaccination on cervical screening.
As HPV testing becomes more widely available, particularly withthe advent of vaccines, it will be important to determine how toeducate the community in an effective, strategic, and consistentway.
Cervical screening is a new concept in India. In order to assessthe acceptability of cervical screening, perceptions, andpreferences among women, and reasons for noncompliance withscreening, a review was undertaken wherein women were offered theopportunity to undergo a free screen.
Screening was undertaken using VIA, VILI, and HCII tests followingcounselling, and the service was provided in a location close totheir homes.
Five hundred randomly selected women who did not attend thescreening programme were interviewed by a medical officer. Sheused a structured questionnaire based upon feedback from a seriesof focus group discussions.
The questionnaire included 24 potential reasons for non-complianceand was undertaken by 469 women, 61% of whom were illiterateand 75% were housewives. Most came from poor socioeconomicbackgrounds (86%) and the majority (61%) were < 40 yearsof age.
Reasons for nonattendance varied. Among 232 (49.5%) women whowere unwilling to attend, 46.1% believed that there was noneed for a checkup as they were not sick, while others expressedfears about the cancer detection test (36.2%). Some womenfelt that they might also experience problems reported by arelative/neighbour following testing (27.6%). Among otherresponses, the most common was a fatalistic approach to destiny(18.5%).
Over 40% of nonattendees were willing to acceptscreening but could not attend the clinic due to various reasons,the commonest being work or family commitments. In this group26.5% of respondents claimed that their husband/in-laws didnot allow them to be tested. One in 20 women claimed to have beenadvised against testing by their doctor.
A small number (5.8%) attended clinic without being tested;some became impatient with waiting, were scared by the instrumentsor refused to be seen by a male doctor (2.1%).
Women (N = 498) from 13 randomly selected villages who underwent screening were interviewed by a female social worker. Mostreported no pain or only slight discomfort during screening(94.2%). Some experienced post-screening issues such asburning sensation (5.8%), vaginal discharge (12%) orbleeding (3.8%). Seven women subsequently sought medicalattention for post-screening problems.
The majority of women were satisfied with the screening service(94.6% selected the top three of six rating options) and97% said they would recommend the test to others. A smallnumber (18/498) said their husbands were unhappy with screening.
The most common reasons for dissatisfaction with the screeningwere pain/discomfort during or after screening, long waiting time,failure to address other health complaints, and inadequateexplanation regarding followup.
Noncompliance remains a major barrier to screening in India,reflecting the absence of a preventative health orientation, andthe lack of empowerment of women. This review showed thatscreening is generally well accepted among women, suggesting itshould integrate with primary healthcare.
To maximise the uptake of screening and satisfaction therewith,the interviewed women made the following suggestions.Other medical problems should be addressed.Medical assistance could be offered to children.Medicines should be provided free of charge.Female doctors are preferred.Men should be included in group counselling meetings.

Mass screening for cervical cancer was introduced in Japan in the1960s. In 1982, the government enacted the Health and MedicalService Law for the Aged, which supported annual screening for allwomen > 30 years of age. Screening uses the Japanese Society ofObstetricians and Gynaecologist scheme to classify Pap testcytology with minor modification [96].
In Miyagi prefecture [97], the screening rate of the femalepopulation aged > 30 years was 0.2% in 1961. Thereafter, itgradually increased, and the screening rate was 30.4% in1991. The mortality rate due to cervical cancer fell from 12.1in 1961 to 4.0 in 1994. In Japan, the age-adjusted mortalityrate of uterine carcinoma fell from 21.3 in 1960 to 5.3 in1993. Cervical cancer is the 8th in the rank of cancer deaths inwomen. The reduction seemed to be due to the spread of screening.A 1998 statement of government endorsed the efficacy of screening,stating that further reductions in mortality would occur[96].
However, the Japanese national government stopped funding cancerscreening in 1998. At present, the decline in screening rate is alarge problem. The annual screening rate of cervical cancernationwide has fallen since 1993, since the opportunity ofappropriate education by government in cervical cancer decreased[98]. In 1997, some mass media with a lack of knowledge claimed that mass screening for cervical cancer might not beeffective. Only 22% of women underwent a Pap test in 2002 inJapan, whereas among women aged 18–44 years in the USA, almost90% had been screened in the previous 3 years [99].
In all ages, the mortality had steadily decreased until 1990, butchanged to an upward trend after 1995. In terms of age, there is atendency that the mortality has decreased in the population aged> 50 years but has increased those < 50 years since 1990, andthe increase is more remarkable in the younger population (Figure 4)[98].
Recognising some of the problems associated with cervical cancerscreening in Japan, the Anticancer Committee of the JapanAssociation of Obstetrics and Gynecologists appealed for revisedlegislation. It was proposed that eligibility for screening beextended in an effort to detect cervical cancer earlier, avoidhysterectomies, and allow women to conceive. Legislation wasrevised in 2005 to initiate biennial screening for women from 20years of age and to improve education regarding HPV.
An internet survey of 2000 randomly selected Japanese women(20–59 years of age) was undertaken in April 2005. This wasdesigned to evaluate knowledge of cervical cancer, motivation forparticipation in screening, and knowledge of papillomavirus andtests for HPV.
Over 1000 (51.9%) questionnaires were available for analysis.
More than half the women surveyed said they knew about cervicalcancer and the methods of cervical cancer screening. A similarnumber (51.3%) were aware that the incidence of cervicalcancer had increased in Japan in recent years, yet almost 60%were unaware that the disease was not terminal when detected earlyand treated.
The most frequently mentioned sources of information wereTV/radio, books, and the Internet. Although 49% of respondentssaid they had been tested for cervical cancer, only 18% werescreened annually.
Among women who were not screened, the most common reasons citedwere the troublesome nature, cost or shame of the procedure, andinadequate time. Very few women (13%) were aware of HPV or itsmeans of infection.
However, at least three in five (61%) said they would bewilling to undertake an HPV test.
One hundred and twenty-six respondents made suggestions as to howscreening could be improved. Their demands were mainly for moreinformation and/or funding from the government to reduce the costof the tests. Some expressed the desire for greater protection ofprivacy (55 mentioned having a female doctor) and for screening tobe easier.
There is clearly inadequate education and understanding ofcervical cancer within the community. Furthermore, there ispresently no clear quality direction for the screeningprogramme—Pap testing is not liquid-based, is not classified bythe Bethesda system, or backed up with an HPV DNA test. There areno guidelines for SIL management.
Recommendations to improve the system include extending annualscreening to women < 30 years of age, with biennial screeningfor women > 30 years following three consecutive negative tests,or including HPV DNA testing in a triennial screen [100].
Regardless of the method, more education on cervical cancer,screening, and HPV is needed.
The Philippines is an archipelago of 7167 islands, with apopulation of more than 87 million people. It is a young nation byage—only 4% of the population are > 65 years of age.Poverty is widespread, and communication and transport aredifficult, particularly in rural areas.
Pap smears cost P400 (US$7). The minimum daily wage is US$3.57and the average family income is US$221/month. Preventativehealth is a luxury.
Twenty million women are aged 25–55, the target population forcervical cancer screening. Twenty-three percent of women haveexperienced sexual activity by age of 24, including 1.2%before age of 13.
Cervical cancer is the Philippines' fourth most prevalent cancer,behind lung, breast, and liver tumours.
In a single year, there are over 4500 new cases of cervicalcancer. Most (93.5%) are linked to HPV 16 or 18, and are notdetected until they have become invasive. The incidence is likelyto be underestimated—systematic data gathering is poor,particularly in rural areas where the majority of the population(62%) lives. Coverage by the Cancer Registry is only 25%.
There is no organised and sustained cervical cancer controlprogramme, and only 12% of the population are screened.Responsibility for such a programme was recently moved from theDepartment of Health (DOH) to Local Government Units.Unfortunately, these units are overloaded with patients andmultitasking reduces their effectiveness.
Knowledge about cancer, and particularly cervical cancer, is poor,due to the lack of readily available responsible publicinformation and trained medical personnel.
Among the 3600 general practitioner graduates from 39 medicalschools each year, 68% leave for overseas, as do 50% ofnursing graduates. Those who do not migrate practice in urbanareas, leaving rural areas under the care of inadequately trainedhealth workers. Education regarding cervical screening must extendbeyond doctors to include cytotechnologists, gynaecological andoncology nurses, and midwives. In many areas, screeningcurrently relies on barangay (public) health workers.
A range of options are under consideration to improve populationscreening for cervical cancer. Before systems can be expandeddramatically and a public information campaign is initiated,diagnostic and therapeutic facilities must be able to cope withincreased demand.
The Cervical Cancer Research Project has been planned as acooperative venture between local, national, and internationalorganisations. In 2002, a pilot programme began in Cebu province,which is now being used as a training centre for implementation inother provinces. The DOH mandated the implementation of animproved national screening programme in 2005.
A training manual has been developed and guidelines prepared forsetting up clinics. The plan includes a directory of key contactsand a registry of the target population.
When diagnostic and therapeutic centres are in place andsustainable, there will be a media campaign to educate women, withongoing health education to maintain their interest. Advocacymeetings among medical, diagnostic, more general interest groupsand support groups, are planned. Solutions have been identifiedfor resource and programme sustainability problems.
Simple and less expensive methods of cervical screening based onvisual examination of the uterine cervix are currently beinginvestigated as alternatives in low-resource settings. VIA hasbeen widely evaluated for accuracy in detecting CIN 2/3 lesions inresearch settings in low-resource countries. Suspicious CINlesions are characterised by well-defined acetowhite areas in thetransformation zone surrounding the cervical os, in closeproximity with the squamo-columnar junction, or by acetowhitelesions occupying the entire cervix. The immediate availability oftest results following VIA facilitates the diagnosis and treatmentof lesions in the same session, which has important logisticaladvantages and ensures a high participation.
A series of reports on the use of VIA in South Africa[101–103], Zimbabwe [104], Iran [105], Egypt[106], Uganda [107], Cameroun [108], Peru[109], China [110], and India [111–113]suggests that its sensitivity to detect CIN 2/3 lesions rangedfrom 67–94% and the specificity from 44–96%. Pooled data from several studies indicate that the average sensitivity andspecificity of VIA to detect high-grade cervical lesions is around70% and 80%, respectively. VIA had a similar or highersensitivity than that of cervical cytology in many studies indeveloping countries where both the tests were concurrently used,although it had a lower specificity than Pap smear. Three studiesthat compared VIA with and without magnification provided variableresults for specificity and sensitivity, but notably results werefairly consistent within each study, indicating that magnificationdid not improve the test performance over and above that of nakedeye visualisation [101, 113, 114].
The efficacy of a once in a life-time VIA screening in reducingincidence of and mortality from cervical cancer is being assessedin two cluster RTCs in India. In one, women aged 30–59 years inDindigul district, South India, were randomised to VIA screeningby nurses (n = 48 225) and to a control group (n = 30 167),which received health education and existing care [50, 115].Of the 30 577 eligible women screened, 2939 (9.6%)VIA-positive women were investigated with colposcopy by nurses and2777 (9.1%) women had biopsy. The detection rates of lesionsper 1000 screened women in this study were 58.2 for CIN 1, 7.3for CIN 2-3, and 2.3 for invasive cancer. Followup of the studygroups is in progress to establish cervical cancer incidence andmortality.
The second trial, involving 130 000 women in Osmanabad district,Western India, investigated the cost-effectiveness of a singleround of VIA, cytology, and HPV testing in reducing cervicalcancer incidence and mortality as compared to a control group withusual care (no screening) [116]. Of the eligible women, 72–74% were screened. Test positivity rates were 14.0%for VIA, 7.0% for cytology, and 10.3% for HPV. Thedetection rate of high-grade lesions was similar in allintervention arms (0.7% for VIA, 1.0% for cytology and0.9% for HPV testing), with 53–67% of invasive cancersdiagnosed in the screened groups during stage I as compared to19% in the control group. The total costs per eligible womanfor screening and diagnosis were US$4.5, US$7.3, andUS$12.7 with VIA, cytology, and HPV, respectively [117].Between 10% and 24% of these costs were programmatic,including implementation and management. The cost per CIN 2/3detected using VIA compared with no screening was $775 (95% CI678–893); the incremental cost of cytology compared to VIA wasUS$1135 (95% CI 794–1958) per CIN2/3 detected [117]. Theultimate effectiveness of the three approaches will become clearwith followup for cancer incidence and mortality.
Studies indicate that women are willing to participate in andaccept VIA screening, and detection rates of early lesions usingvisual testing attest to its validity and usefulness. Goodtraining is needed to achieve fairly accurate and moderatelyreproducible results with visual tests in developing countries. Awide range of health care providers including trained medical andnonmedical personnel can provide VIA after roughly 5–10 days ofcompetency-based training.
Quality assurance of visual screening in field conditions poses amajor challenge. Close monitoring of test positivity and diseasedetection rates as well as periodic retraining are essential tomaintain good standards of visual testing. While a resultantreduction in the incidence and mortality associated with cervicalcancer following VIA screening has not yet been proven, this iscurrently being addressed in randomised screening trials.
A nationwide cancer prevention programme using annual Pap smearshas dramatically reduced cervical cancer incidence and resultantmortality in Japan. However, the Pap test is not always accurate,and false-negative results can have serious implications. This hasled to a reevaluation of the cancer screening programme in Japan.
A recent study evaluated a combination of Pap smear and HPV DNAtesting for routine cervical cancer screening. The focus was onIshikawa prefecture, in the northwest of Japan's main island.Kanazawa is the capital of this prefecture, which has a populationof 1.2 million.
More than 8000 women were recruited into the study between October2003 and April 2004. Two cytology samples were taken from theectocervix using a cytobrush, one for Pap smear and the other forHPV DNA test. HC II for high-risk types of papillomaviruses wasused, and positive samples were classified further using theDNA-chip method.
Cytological diagnosis was according to the classification systemestablished by the Japanese Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology(JSOG). This differs from the Bethesda system in classificationterminology, but classifications IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V wouldequate to the ASCUS, LSIL, HSIL, and invasive cancer categories.Colposcopy and biopsy were recommended in all cases cataloguedabove JSOG II.
HPV was detected in 7% of women with normal cytology. Overallincidence of HPV infection was 11%. It was more common foryounger women to test positive for HPV than older women, with45% of women aged 15–19 years testing positive. More than 1500women in their 20s were tested—24% were positive forhigh-risk HPV. In women > 40 years of age, levels of infectionfell to 4–7%.
There was a higher incidence of Class IIIa cytology among HPV+women (74%) than among HPV− women (41%). Among 26 womenwhose cytology was normal, but who had CIN lesions on histology,23 (88%) tested HPV+. Among 57 women with abnormal cytology,86% had CIN lesions and 92% were HPV+. This demonstratedthe potential for HPV testing to detect women graded normal withroutine cytological screening, despite serious lesions (CIN3 orinvasive cancer).
Those samples that were positive with hybrid capture assay werefurther examined using Biomed-Lab DNA-Chip. The most frequentlydetected type of HPV in these Japanese women was HPV 52, followedby HPV 16.
Almost half the samples were infected with more than a single HPVtype. Multiple infection was more common among younger women,particularly those in their late teens.
It was more common to find multiple infections in women with CINlesions than in women with invasive cancer.
In 2004, as a result of these findings, Japan introduced a newapproach to screening for cervical cancer. Samples withquestionable cytology (ASCUS using the Bethesda classificationsystem) are routinely examined for HPV DNA. HPV+ women are thenrecalled for colposcopy.
As in this sample from Kanazawa city, it is clear that the use ofHPV testing has improved the positive predictive value of cervicalcancer screening. Among 400 samples that revealed questionablecytology, 50 cases were HPV+ on testing, so an additional 42women were referred to colposcopy. This detected an additionalfour cases of CIN2 lesions and two of CIN3 lesions. These sixwomen were treated surgically—earlier than if the HPV test hadnot been used.
In conclusion, the combination of Pap cytology and HPV tests hasimproved cancer screening efficacy.
The HPV DNA test incurs additional costs. However, for women whoare negative on cytology and HPV, the inter-screening intervalcould be extended, thereby recouping the cost.
Data from 1996 showed that cervical cancer was the most commoncancer in Thailand women, with an ASR of 19.5, higher than thatfor breast cancer (ASR ∼ 17.2) [118].
Within Thailand, incidence varies between regions, with Chiang Mai(ASR 25.6) and Lampang (23.6) having higher than nationallevels. The age prevalence is fairly consistent between regions,peaking at 45–55 years of age.
Unlike more economically developed countries, where most cervicalcarcinomas are detected early, only one in five Thai cancers willbe detected in Stage 1 [119].
In 2005, the cervical cancer incidence was 19.5/100 000 women.This equates to 30 000 cases of invasive cancer over a 5-yearperiod. Five women die from cervical cancer every day in Thailand,and 10 new cases are detected daily.
Thailand has limited resources for screening. In 2004, acytology-based programme was established, which recommendedscreening every 5 years and aimed to achieve 50% coverage. Thescreens were most commonly undertaken at family planning clinics.
By 2005, the programme was demonstrating coverage rates of only10–15%. The lack of cytoscreeners and pathologists led to longdelays in receiving test results, and no firm policy had beenestablished to assist healthcare professionals to deal withabnormal results.
An intensive and thorough training programme has now begun tobuild competency in VIA and cryotherapy.
Clinics are encouraged to rely on VIA if Pap smears are notperformed efficiently. Ten of the 75 Thai provinceshave adopted this approach. Women 30–45 years of age areencouraged to be screened every 5 years. The objective is toachieve 80% coverage over 5 years.
In Roi Et Province, a concerted effort has been made to deliverthe screening service to women. Mobile units visit rural healthcentres. With these intensive mobile units, district teams areable to test three times as many women in a week as services atdistrict hospitals. This success has demonstrated theeffectiveness of taking the service to the women, rather thanrelying on women to attend screening at a distant location.
Health centres staffed by 3–5 persons are at the core ofThailand's primary care system. They generally provideapproximately 5000 residents from 8–12 villages with basicmedical care and health prevention and promotion programmes.
Involvement of the health centre staff in cervical cancerprevention activities is essential. They identify the targetpopulation by visiting all community households and build aregistry of names of women in the 30–45-year target age group, totrack their attendance at clinics.
The community health centre takes responsibility for organising,promoting, and coordinating designated cervical screening days.Staff will inform the local population about the VIA test usingloudspeakers, letters, and presentations. Health volunteers ineach village also contact women directly.
This programme has proved being more reliable and efficient thanany other, and is being expanded to additional districts andprovinces.
Since 1980, Korea has had a national tracking system for majorcancers, which includes site-specific and regional tracking. Thedatabase for national cancer incidence is estimated to be 95%complete.
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Korean women.With an AAR of 15.5 in 2001, it is less common than cancers ofthe stomach, breast, and colon/rectum.
Between 1993 and 2001, the curves for age-specific incidence ofuterine cancer fell, with this trend most marked among women50–70 years of age (Figure 5).
Almost 40% of malignant cervical cases are being detected insitu, before they become invasive. For women diagnosed withcervical cancer during the period 1995–2001, 6.6% diedwithin 12 months. Almost 80% survived for at least 5 years.
There are local variations in the incidence and mortality ofcervical cancer. Morphologically, the majority of tumours(∼ 80%) are of squamous cell origin; however, duringthe 10 years from 1993, there was a growing proportion ofadenocarcinomas (6.9% in 1993; 10.4% in 2001). The5-year survival rate for adenocarcinomas (74.3%) is less thanthat for SCC (81.4%).
Key factors associated with a lower risk of cervical cancer inKorean women are [120]no family history,no/few children,marriage,late first sex,circumcision.In a review of HPV types in Busan for the IARC HPV InternationalPrevalence Survey, the seropositivity of antibodies to HR-HPV(types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 58) was 19.8% among sexuallyactive women 20–74 years of age. The most common types were HPV70, HPV 33, and HPV 16 [121]. All seven women with HSILlesions on cytology tested positive for HR-HPV.
no family history,
no/few children,
marriage,
late first sex,
circumcision.
This trial was undertaken by the Korea National Cancer Center withthe Unit of Field and Intervention Studies in the InternationalAgency for Research on Cancer, in 2002, to determine at what agewomen become sexually active, exposed to HPV-DNA, and thenseropositive for HPV 16 and HPV 18. It also provided anopportunity to assess willingness to participate in future HPVvaccine trials.
Students 16–26 years of age attended a health education class andwere asked to complete a survey. They provided a blood sample andeither a vaginal (self-collected) or penile (physician-collected)swab.
Among 672 females, 15.2% tested positive to HPV, 9.4% ofwhom tested positive to a high-risk type. Among this latter group,there was a high frequency of infection with multiple strains.Among males 8.7% tested positive for HPV [122]. The risk for infection clearly rose with the number of lifetime sexualpartners.
Among this group of 1100 university students, 64% of men and58% of women said they would be willing to participate in atrial for HPV vaccines.
Since 1988, medical insurance beneficiaries have received a Papsmear for cervical cancer check as part of their general healthcheckup. In 1999, the National Screening Program began coveringMedicaid patients' screens for stomach, breast, and cervicalcancers. Since this time, coverage has been expanded and about50% of insured patients are currently included.
The current recommendation is that all women > 30 years of ageshould have a Pap smear every 2 years. Participation in cervicalscreening in 2002 was 15.6% and 10.8% in 2003.Incorporation of HPV testing into the screening process mayimprove sensitivity and allow the screening interval for manywomen to be extended.
In 1988–1992, the AAR of cervical cancer in Taiwan(22.2/100 000) was higher compared with other Asian nationswith Chinese populations, such as Singapore (16.3/100 000) andHong Kong (15.3/100 000).
In 1995, Taiwan instituted the National Cervical Screening Programfor women aged > 30 years.
As part of the programme, extensive and ongoing training has beenintroduced for cytotechnicians, nurses who collect samples, andgynaecologists undertaking colposcopy. To participate in theprogramme, laboratories and their staff must be accredited and arereviewed regularly.
Every year since 2000, more than 50% of eligible women hadparticipated in cervical screening within the previous 3 years.From 9.2% of eligible Taiwanese women screened in 1995,screening levels rose annually until 2001, when 30.1% ofwomen undertook a screening test; 27.1% of Taiwanese womenwere screened in 2003.
When the programme began, cervical cancer levels appeared to risefrom 30–35/100 000 in 1995 to over 50 in 2000. This probablyreflected more frequent diagnosis due to increased screeninglevels, rather than greater incidence. Furthermore, the AAIRpeaked in 1999 and declined in the next 2 years. During the sametime period, the proportion of cancers that were detected in siturelative to invasive cancers rose dramatically, reflecting earlierdiagnosis of the condition.
In 1992, a nationwide survey of more than 13 000 women wasundertaken across seven counties and reported by Liawet al [123]. This demonstrated the very high incidence of HPVinfection among woman showing cervical abnormalities. Among womenwithout lesions, the incidence of HPV infection was 9%; among40 women with CIN1 changes, HPV incidence was 54%; and amongthose with CIN2, CIN3, and invasive cancer (n = 48), theincidence of HPV infection was 92%. HPV strains 52 and 58 werethe most commonly detected.
Hsu et al reported the results of a population screen for HPVvirus using MY09/11 PCR and sequencing [124]. Among women > 55 years of age, the incidence of HPV infection was 19.4%.Age-specific data from 1999 demonstrate the highest levels ofconfirmed cervical cancer among women aged 70–74 years, an agewhere incidence peaked at over 180/100 000 women.
The link between infection with HPV and the development ofcervical cancer is also reflected in other results. Patients whoshowed SIL on Pap test were eligible for the study; 1284 womenwere recruited. Infection with HPV was confirmed using HCII andPCR-Strip testing. Among those with low-grade lesions, theincidence of HPV infection was 75%. Those with high-gradelesions had an HPV incidence of 83.6%. All (100%) 16 womenwith invasive carcinoma tested positive for HPV.
Further research has evaluated the relative risk of cervicalcancer for different strains of HPV. More than half of women(51%) with cervical SCC tested positive for HPV 16, while HPVs18, 58, and 33 were also frequently detected. In cervicaladenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinomas, HPV 18 was detectedin 58.8% and HPV 16 in 35.3% of affected women. Among263 cases of cervical cancer in Taiwan, the majority were linkedto five strains of HPV: 16 (50.7%); 18 (11.9%); 58(10.1%); 33 (8.4%) and 52 (3.1%).
ASCUS and AGUS abnormalities detected cytologically, andfrequently associated with venereal warts, were also evaluated forHPV status (n = 436). Strains of HPV most frequently associatedwith ASCUS and AGUS cytology were 52 (18%), 16 (15%), and 58(15%).
Among the Taiwanese population, HPV types identified ashigh risk for cervical cancer are most prevalent, occurring atmore than twice the frequency of all other types of HPV. In asurvey of 4190 people who tested positive for HPV, the most commontypes were 52 (22.3%), 16 (11.7%), and 58 (11.2%).Low-risk types were detected in 18.4% of cases.
Compared with other countries, Taiwan has a disproportionatelyhigh incidence of HPVs 52 and 58. This dramatically contrasts withEurope, where HPV 16 is the predominant strain.Phylogenetic trees show that differences in the origins of HPVs 58and 52 can be traced in Asian nations such as Thailand, Hong Kong,and Taiwan.
Pilot studies are now underway to investigate the mostcost-effective way to include routine HPV testing in Taiwan'scervical screening programme. A self-screening test usingmenstruation pads is among the options being investigated.
Due to the extensive recording undertaken for the screeningprogramme, Taiwan has data to conduct simulation modelling, whichcan aid planning decisions. The country has also been involved intrials for HPV vaccines currently in development. In theshort-term, decisions will be made regarding frequency of testing(possibly extended to 5 years) and the timing of HPV testingrelative to smears and cytology.
Taiwan has already experienced success with a vaccination toprevent cancer. Following the launch of mass vaccination againsthepatitis B, incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma droppedsignificantly.
As the majority of cervical cancers can be linked to infectionwith a few high-risk strains of HPV, vaccination offerssignificant potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancerin Taiwan.
Emerging evidence has changed the way low-grade cytologicalchanges are viewed, but it has not clarified patient management.Members of the Ontario Cervical Screening Program reviewed theavailable evidence in order to optimise national guidelines.
The interdisciplinary guideline committee defined a series ofquestions regarding the cervical screening process, with the aimof defining the optimal management for women with abnormalcytology (up to, but not including, colposcopy).
The Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Education (AGREE)process was chosen as the framework for reviewing the guidelines.AGREE consists of 23 Likert-scale items organised into sixdomains, and offers confidence that potential biases in guidelinedevelopment have been addressed.
The guideline search and retrieval included some online databases,known guideline developer websites (e.g.,http://www.guideline.gov andhttp://www.g-i-n.net), systematic review websites (e.g.,http://www.cochrane.org andhttp://www.who.int), and references cited on other materials.
Materials specific for LSIL included published guidelines from theAmerican Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP),2001 [125], and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), 2004 [126]; one RCT; one meta-analysis; fourretrospective studies; and one conference report.
Each source was subsequently evaluated by the panel according toAGREE classifications covering quality, currency, and content.
The two existing guidelines were subjected to detailed review,which considered their scope, stakeholders, rigour, clarity,applicability, and editorial independence.
Every recommendation within the guidelines was reviewed accordingto the level of evidence on which it had been based. Two differentranking systems were used in this process (Table 6).
Low-grade lesions present a dilemma when detected duringscreening. Half of the women with LSIL cytology will be normal ifchecked subsequently after 4–6 months, yet the remainder willprogress to HSIL or invasive cancer within 2 years [127].
Three management approaches could be taken for these patients:no action, but repeat cytology in 4–6 months,immediate colposcopy,HPV testing.The ASCUS/LSIL Triage Study (ALTS) Group evaluated 5000 women todetermine how best to manage these early, inconclusive lesions.They found that HPV testing was likely to be positive and wouldnot clarify management.
no action, but repeat cytology in 4–6 months,
immediate colposcopy,
HPV testing.
The ASCCP Guidelines, based on Level CIII evidence, permitmultiple paths following LSIL cytology, with differentrecommendations for teens and postmenopausal women.
Moscicki suggested further revisions to approaches foradolescents. He believed that LSIL reflected an HPV infection, andcommented that “most guidelines in the USA were overaggressive intheir management of abnormal cytology in adolescents and youngwomen (resulting in) costly over-treatment” [128]. The median time for HPV clearance is 8–14 months. A repeat Pap smear12 months after the LSIL finding would allow for 20–25% ofcases to regress.
The NHMRC based their 2004 recommendations on Level CII evidence.If a woman is > 30 years of age and has not experienced negativecytology in the previous 2-3 years, she should have immediatecolposcopy or repeat cytology after 6 months. If the woman is onbiennial surveillance or < 30 years of age with no cervicalcytology history, repeat cytology screening in 12 months. A womanshould be referred for colposcopy following two abnormal tests; ifthe second test is normal, it should be repeated after 12 months.
The guideline panel then needed to decide which guideline/s wouldbest meet Canada's needs and goals.
The Program in Evidence-Based Medicine recommended that women withLSIL on Pap smear should be sent for colposcopy or repeatcytology after 6 months (B-II). All women whose cytology isabnormal on the second test should be referred for colposcopy. Ifthe second Pap test is normal, it should be repeated again after afurther 6 months and the woman referred if the result is ASCUS orabnormal (C-III).
Surveys were completed by 180 physicians to review the guidelineproposal. Approximately half agreed that patient outcomes would beimproved by the proposed changes. However, there was universalagreement that referring all LSIL cases for colposcopy would beimpractical.
After deciding which people and organisations should endorse thedocument, plans were made to launch the revised guidelines inSeptember 2005. Following publication, the document will bereviewed annually.
Evidence was reviewed to assess different management approachesfor women who have low-grade neoplasia on biopsy (CIN1). Availableevidence did not suggest whether it would be better to followupthe finding at a later date or to treat the lesion immediately.
Treatment decisions were based on histological results. However,there was huge variability in how operators coded their findings.False-positives and uncertainty lead to unnecessaryinvestigations, possible over-treatment, anxiety, and increasedcost.
A number of investigative immunochemistry techniques offer newinsights and potentially more objective foundations for clinicalmanagement.
Among the most promising is p16(INK)4a, a protein marker that isonly present in cases of cancer, CIN 2/3, and CIN1 lesionsassociated with HR-HPV [130, 131].
As part of a randomised trial in the best management strategy forbiopsy proven CIN1, cone biopsies (n = 194) were reviewed by fivepathologists and coded [130]. Although there was variability between the pathologists, p16(INK)4a testing reduced the number offalse-negative and false-positive results.
A study was undertaken to determine whether p16(INK)4a or otheradjuvant techniques might enhance the evaluation of CIN1 (LSIL)lesions [132]. Following the classification of cervicalbiopsies as CIN1, women were tested for HR-HPV using HCII andseparately for p16(INK)4a. Five pathologists reviewed the blocks.
Histopathologic diagnosis was most confused when rating a sampleas either CIN1 or normal/reactive. The inconclusive samples weremore frequently positive for HPV than for p16(INK)4a.
However, 23% of benign cases were also positive for p16(INK)4a,and half of these were positive for HPV. Ongoing monitoring willreveal the role of p16(INK)4a in these patients' disease courses.
A substantial number of CIN1 patients were negative forp16(INK)4a. Whether p16(INK)4a-positivity has significance interms of natural history requires ongoing followup of thesecases.
Approaches to treatment for HSIL depend upon the type of histology(squamous, glandular, mixed), the size and accessibility of thelesion, the patient's stage of life and the surgical optionsavailable.
If the whole lesion is not visualised as it involves theendocervical canal, a loop or cone biopsy should be taken. If itis in range, the lesion can be removed by loop, cone, or surgicalablation.
If microinvasion or ESI are suspected, the margins on the biopsywill be important in guiding management. A cold knife is lesslikely to denature cells than a loop, and is therefore preferredfor reviewing margins.
In the case of noninvasive HSIL, either procedure can be used.There is limited guidance on what endpoint determines a successfuloutcome. Rate of recurrence of CIN is perhaps the best measure toguide followup.
A Cochrane review reported on 28 trials using different surgicaltechniques to manage CIN without identifying any “obviouslysuperior technique [23].”
The LEEP approach has been linked to a number of obstetricdifficulties. A systemic review that factored in smoking,concluded that following LEEP, women were more likely to givebirth preterm (OR 1.81; P = .006), but there was nodifference in likelihood of caesarean delivery, precipitouslabour, induction or neonatal intensive care admission [133].
A retrospective cohort study in Nova Scotia, Canada, by Samsonet al reported similar results—LEEP is associated with anincreased risk of preterm delivery, PROM, and LBW infants insubsequent pregnancies [134].
A New Zealand study concluded that LEEP and laser cone treatmentswere associated with significantly increased risk of PROM[135]. The risk increased with cone length.
Studies at the Royal Women's Hospital, Carlton, Victoria, Canada,indicate that dysplasia itself is associated with prematurity andthat all excisional methods increase this risk.
The FIGO classification system for microinvasive carcinoma hasbeen used since 1995. FIGO Stage 1A tumours are superficiallyinvasive and can only be diagnosed microscopically. They aredifferentiated by depth of invasion and horizontal extension. Noconsideration is given to vascular space involvement or to specialinvasion patterns.
To date, no RCTs have been published comparing managementapproaches with outcomes in microinvasive carcinoma.
When classifying biopsies, processing is critical. Considerationshould be given to how the specimen has been prepared—radialversus sagittal sections, whole specimen, special stains, and soforth.
In distinguishing ESI from CIN 3, if the margins on a specimen areclear, there is no indication for hysterectomy. Seven reportsinclude results on the use of cone resection alone for ESI. Among255 cases of FIGO Stage IA1 tumours, there were sixrecurrences; of 18 cases of Stage IA2, there were threerecurrences [136–138].
Östör and Rome reported on long-term outcomes ina series of women treated for microinvasive carcinoma when nodeswere positive. Twenty-three patients subsequently died in spite oftreatment—those women generally had deeper lesions (3–5 mm)[138].
Rome and Brown were able to demonstrate the anticipated higherrisk of recurrence in patients with < 3 mm invasion whereLVSI was identified pathologically [139]. Relative risk of recurrence for their sample of 131 LVS-positive women was 7.42(CI = 2.36–22.61). For 92 women for whom the area of invasionwas 3–5 mm with LVSI, the relative risk rose to 22.25 (CI= 5.9–57.96) compared with those who were LVS-negative.
At the Royal Women's Hospital (RWH) in Melbourne, Australia,disease management recommendations for microinvasive lesions areas follows.If 1–3 mm invasion, treat as for ESI, unless LVS isseen. Consider hysterectomy in postmenopausal women and whenchildbearing is complete.When the invasive zone is 3–5 mm, a hysterectomy ispreferred; however, where fertility is an issue, a cone resectionincluding lymph nodes is an option.In cases where the margins of the biopsy are positive, and theinvasive depth ≤ 3 mm, the cone may be repeated andretested. If CIN is present at the ecto/endocervix, follow withcolposcopy/cytology and ECC.

AIS is a recognisable precursor to invasive cancer. It isfrequently multifocal and often associated with squamous lesions.The predictive value of cytology is 75%. Since the 1970s, theincidence of AIS (relative and absolute) has increased; HPV 18 andoral contraceptives have been implicated.
Soutter et al reported retrospective outcomes for 53 women inEngland, whose AIS was treated with cone alone [140]. Ten percent had early invasive lesions detected on second cone orhysterectomy. At 4 years, the cumulative incidence of hysterectomywas 21%, so long-term surveillance is needed postsurgery.
This classification includes glandular carcinomas such asendocervical, villoglandular, intestinal, endometroid, clear cell,and adenosquamous.
Östör and Rome reported outcomes for 436 womenwith microinvasive adenocarcinoma defined as invasion≤ 5 mm, and associated with complete obliteration ofnormal endocervical crypts, extension beyond normal glandularfields, and stromal response [141]. Of these women, 126underwent radical hysterectomy, not necessarily with simultaneousremoval of adnexa. There were 15 recurrences and six deaths fromthe disease.
Another report reviewed retrospective data and recommended that,where invasion was < 5 mm, the likelihood of lymph nodemetastasis and disease recurrence were very small, and thereforeconservative surgery could be considered with some confidence[142].
With the limited data available, the RWH makes the followingrecommendations.Conisation is a good approach when lesions are < 3 mm.Lymphadenectomy is recommended whenever LVS is positive.Recone if there is any uncertainty.For lesions 3–5 mm, a simple hysterectomy is recommended.
Conisation is a good approach when lesions are < 3 mm.
Lymphadenectomy is recommended whenever LVS is positive.

Adequate data are available to make recommendations for squamouslesions with confidence. It is likely that adenocarcinomas can bemanaged similarly, although more data are needed to providestatistical validation.
Genital warts (condylomata acuminata) is one of the most common STIs worldwide, usually resulting from infection with HPVtypes 6 and 11 [143].
The highest rates of genital HPV infection are in sexually activewomen < 25 years of age. Highest incidence for both genders isbetween 18 and 28 years of age [144].
In developed countries, genital HPV infection has increasedsteadily since the 1950s [144]. About 1% of all sexuallyactive adults have had or currently have genital warts[143, 144].
There are many ways to remove warts (cryotherapy, diathermy/laserablation, surgical incision, or with trichloracetic acid), butrecurrences are common (30–60%). Antiproliferative agents suchas podophyllotoxin or 5-FU will cause the warts to regress.
There is no specific antiviral agent for HPV. However, the immunemodulator imiquimod, which has specific but broad antiviralactivities, has been an approved therapy specifically for genitalwarts and has been endorsed in US-CDC [145], Latin American[146], European [147], and Australian [148]antimicrobial guidelines. The cream is a patient-applied treatmentand used on the affected areas, three times a week.
Imiquimod induces interferon-alpha in an early, nonspecific,innate immune response as well as stimulating CMI [149, 150].Its antiviral activity mimics the natural immune response andlimits production of HPV; its antiproliferative activity slowsgrowth of infected keratinocytes.
Activated dendritic cells engulf HPV from infected cells andprocess the viral antigens on their cell surface [151]. Theyleave the skin via draining lymphatic channels. When they meet andinteract with T-cells that have the specific receptor for HPVantigens, the T-cells begin to divide and migrate from the lymphnode to the bloodstream [149, 150]. Once activated, theseHPV-specific T-cells express the adhesion molecule antigens LFA-1and VLA-4 on their surface.
Stimulated by the presence of cytokines and chemokines, T-cellsand monocytes migrate toward the site of infection. The T-cellsinvade the wart and kill infected cells, which are thenphagocytosed.
The wart gradually clears and immune memory is established. Thiscan reduce recurrences, as newly infected keratinocytes will berapidly killed.
A 1998 study reported the outcomes of an intent-to-treat RCT ofself-administered imiquimod cream in 311 patients with externalanogenital warts [152]. The cream was administered three times per week until clearance, or for a maximum of 16 weeks.Followup was for an additional 12 weeks. Among patients usingplacebo creams, 11% of patients' warts resolved spontaneously.Among those using imiquimod, total clearance was achieved in72% of women and 33% of men (P < .0001). If the endpoint was > 50% wart reduction, overall success was 76% for imiquimod patients compared with 28% for placebo. Erythema at the wartsite occurred in two-thirds of patients using imiquimod cream,while smaller numbers experienced erosion (32%), excoriation(24%), oedema (16%), and scabbing (15%). Interestingly,erythema was reported by one in four who received the placebocream containing no active ingredient.
Another study sought to determine whether subgroup demographicsinfluenced treatment outcome [153]. The conclusion was thatimiquimod provides a significant benefit independent of gender,initial wart area, duration of current outbreak of warts, previouswart treatment, or tobacco use. However, clearance rate wasinfluenced by circumcision—it was ∼33% higher inuncircumcised males. Thrice weekly application was found to be aslightly more efficacious regime than daily application, achievingtotal clearance in 62% of participants. Furthermore, there werefewer reports of adverse events. Erythema, erosion, flaking, orulceration were common.
Patients around the world who had previously been treated usingcryotherapy or podophyllin rated imiquimod superior with regard toits convenience and lack of pain [154].
A series of trials also demonstrated the efficacy of imiquimod asan adjunct to ablation (post-laser ablation [155], combined with surgery [156], following surgery to remove anal canal condyloma [157]). It was generally well tolerated and reducedrecurrence rate.
The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention, Volume 10, was launchedfollowing a meeting in Lyon, France, in April 2004.
The Working Group of the IARC concluded that screening forcervical cancer by Pap smear effectively prevents mortality fromthe disease. However, in order for a cytology screening programmeto reduce death optimally, it must be well organised and havequality control at every step throughout the process. If theseprerequisites are met, an estimated 80% reduction in mortalitycan be achieved.
The Group also concluded that sufficient evidence supports theefficacy of the HPV DNA test in reducing mortality from cervicalcancer, which is a rare outcome of HPV infection. Tests for thepresence of viral DNA in blood sample can signal potentiallyprecancerous lesions. The identification of the role of HPV in theaetiology of cervical cancer has opened new avenues to preventingthe disease by screening and vaccination. The major challenge liesin developing a simple, reliable and affordable test that can beused around the world.
HPV DNA testing is yet to be widely adopted within screeningprogrammes. The suitability of HPV as the primary screening testwill be influenced by public acceptability and cost. As manyinfections are transient, HPV screening below 30 years of age isnot recommended. HPV testing can be used in combination with Papsmears until long-term data on its effectiveness become available.
As much of the cervical cancer disease burden lies in thedeveloping world, effective screening methods need to beapplicable in low-resource settings. VIA or VILI is beingconsidered as a primary screening test by many countries, althoughthere is still insufficient evidence of its efficacy in reducingmortality at the epidemiological level. The validity of thediagnosis depends on the training and skill of the examiningdoctors.
An organised screening programme should cover women aged 25–65years. The IARC advises that annual smears are unnecessary, evenwith conventional cytology. Screening of women < 25 years of ageoffers minimal benefit. For women 25–49 years of age,three-yearly Pap smears are recommended, or five-yearly whereresources are limited. Five-yearly smears from 50–65 years of ageare recommended; screening can cease after 65 years of age,provided there are no suspicious results in the previous twotests (Table 7).
As women with HIV are at higher risk of persistent HPV infections,they should be screened frequently from a younger age.
The need for consistency and rapid turnaround in cytology is adifficult challenge for developing countries. A screeningprogramme based on cytology will be successful only when trainedstaff can provide efficient diagnosis, and resources are availableto investigate and treat abnormal results. It is hoped thatongoing research will make low-cost, low technology screeningmethods viable options for cervical cancer prevention in thesesettings.
LBC and semi-automation may improve outcomes of cytologyscreening, depending on local feasibility. Long-term evaluationand quality control are needed.
New commercial systems based on mRNA require rigorous evaluationbefore they can be adopted for widespread clinical use.Furthermore, education for all health professionals involved incervical cancer screening will be needed.
To improve colposcopy practice, it is necessary to consider theaccuracy of colposcopy and biases that can arise. Studies ofdiagnostic and screening colposcopy provide insights regarding thevalidity of visual signs, their reproducibility, quality control,and how the process is taught.
Those undertaking colposcopy are usually aware that they aredealing with women whose smears were abnormal, a population with ahigher probability of disease; this predisposition to look fordisease may lead to bias.
Descriptive terms used to define abnormal colposcopic findings maybe divided into those considered to be major changes and others.Dense acetowhite epithelium, coarse mosaic, coarse punctuation,iodine negativity, and atypical vessels are all believed to bemajor changes.
A number of studies have evaluated colposcopy's ability todifferentiate normal from abnormal lesions. Mitchellet al reported on a meta-analysis, which concluded that theweighted sensitivity of colposcopy to differentiate normality fromall other cervical abnormalities was 96% and specificity was48% [158].
In differentiating low-grade (normal/LSIL) and high-grade(HSIL/cancer), colposcopy scored 85% for sensitivity and 69%for specificity.
To confirm the efficacy of lesion ablation following colposcopywithout histological confirmation, Belinson et al team reviewed1997 women in rural China [57]. Key factors in determiningefficacy included the quality of the light source; adequacy of theoperators; cervical characteristics such as the presence ofinflammation; and diagnostic thresholds. In another studyinvolving ∼ 8500 women in the same Chinese province,Belinson et al found that self-sampling for HPV DNA detection wasless sensitive for CIN > 2 than the direct cervical sample forHPV DNA, but similar to LBC [58].
A number of published studies have compared colposcopy with othertechniques to evaluate its reliability in screening; conclusionsvary dramatically and are clearly influenced by study design[159–162].
Reid and Scalzi developed a scoring system based on sharpness of alesion's margins alongside colour, vascularisation, and iodinestaining to rate colposcopic findings [163]. Carriero et al found this ranking system to be 86.6% effective incorrectly rating LSIL lesions [164]. A prospective study by Da Forno et al demonstrated the relative significance ofacetowhite colouration, borders and abnormal vessels incolposcopic definitions of “normality [165].”
Pretorius et al recognised that the most likely reason forcolposcopists to overlook malignant lesions was their size[166]. When a lesion/lesions extended across more than one quadrant they were less likely to be under-rated.
“Assuming colposcopists use the same definitions, reproducibilityof colposcopic assessment depends in part on colposcopists usingsimilar “thresholds of certainty” for categorization findings asto normal versus abnormality and grade.” (IARC 2005)
Digital photographic databases can retain data for post-treatmentaudit and comparison between units.
Education is key to quality colposcopy. Consistency, andconsequently quality, can only be maintained if practitioners aretaught via rigorous training programmes to adhere to guidelines,and are regularly accredited.
Over the years, both social and medical researchers have foundstatistical links between observed behaviours and the incidence ofcervical cancer. As early as the 1850s, differences in incidencewere noted between prostitutes and virgins/nuns. During thefollowing century, risk factors for cervical cancer was related towomen whose husbandstravelled as part of their occupation,indulged in extramarital sex or multiple marriages,had cancer of the penis,had a previous wife who had cervical cancer,were uncircumcised.The discovery of HPV as a sexually transmitted carcinogen providedan explanatory context for these observations.

Spain (AAIR for cervical cancer in 1990 = 7.1/100 000), Colombia(34.4), Brazil (37.7), Thailand (22.4), and the Philippines(21.6) were selected for the IARC case-control studies toevaluate the role of males in cervical cancer. Overall, 1921couples were recruited.
The objective was to determine the relationship between men'ssexual behaviour and penile HPV, and subsequently, levels ofcervical HPV infection and cervical cancer in their partners.
There were some key differences in the sexual life and behaviourpatterns in the countries chosen. Men from South America generallyhad more lifetime sexual partners than men from Thailand, Spain,and the Philippines.
In addition, men from Brazil and particularly Colombia were morelikely than those from Spain, Thailand, and the Philippines to haveregular intercourse before they were 18 years of age.
Men from Brazil and Colombia were far more likely to beHPV-positive in the distal urethra than men from Thailand, thePhilippines, and Spain. However, this did not necessarilycorrelate with HPV positivity in their women partners (Table 8).
The ASRs of cervical cancer within the different populationscorrelated closely with both the prevalence of penile HPV and withcervical HPV infections.
The data clearly demonstrate that in countries with low prevalenceof HPV, such as Spain, the risk of cervical cancer in women isinfluenced by the partner's sexual proclivity [167]. However, in Colombia, where the prevalence of HPV is higher, this is lessvisible in epidemiological studies, even when some of the male'spartners may be prostitutes [168].
The interpretation that can be drawn is as follows.HIGH-RISK countries: HPV prevalence in young malesis very high and any given sexual contact conveys a high risk ofexposure. When risk of infection at any given episode ofintercourse is high, increasing the number of sexual partners doesnot greatly increase this already high risk of infection.LOW-RISK countries: HPV prevalence in males is low andonly sexual intercourse with high-risk males or a high number ofpartners for women conveys a high risk of HPV exposure.

In this study, it was more common for men to be uncircumcised (n= 847) than circumcised (n = 292). Uncircumcised men in thestudy were > 3 times more likely to be positive for penile HPV(19.6%) than circumcised men (5.5%) [169]. Overallthe wives of circumcised men were less likely to develop cervicalcancer (OR = 0.75). The relative risk for cervical cancer inmonogamous women with circumcised husbands varied with the men'ssexual proclivity. A wife whose husband's sexual behaviour wasviewed as high risk (> 6 partners and first sexual encounterbefore 16 years of age) was 0.18 times more likely to suffercervical cancer; women whose husbands had low-risk sexualbehaviour gained no benefit from his circumcision.
In future, public health will need to consider the role of themale in planning management programmes for cervical cancer. It isevident that the risks for both infection and cancer developmentare influenced not only by the types and frequency of HPV within apopulation, but also by sexual behaviour. Women who have theirfirst stable sexual relationship at a young age (< 20 years ofage) have a greater risk of cervical cancer.
Societal factors play a major role in sexual relationships, and inthe case of cervical cancer strongly influence nationalepidemiology of HPV-associated disease.
Condom use has been associated not only with lower penileinfection rates and regression of penile lesions, but also withCIN regression and clearance of cervical HPV [170]. In a 2-year trial of women with CIN lesions (n = 82) regressionoccurred in 53% of those whose partners wore condoms, comparedwith 35% of those whose partners did not. Among those withcondom-wearing partners, 23% cleared the HPV infection,compared with only 4% of those whose partners did not wearcondoms.
Males clearly play a role in HPV prevalence within populations.Cervical cancer rates in women would be aided by any of thefollowing:abstinence/monogamy/low promiscuity,late sexual debut (particularly in women),avoiding high-risk partners,consistent use of condoms,male circumcision,vaccination against HPV.
abstinence/monogamy/low promiscuity,
late sexual debut (particularly in women),
avoiding high-risk partners,
consistent use of condoms,
male circumcision,
vaccination against HPV.
HIV infection is not uncommon in many Asian countries. At the endof 2003, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, India, Nepal, and Papua NewGuinea had known prevalence levels > 0.5% [171]. As patients continue to survive longer following HIV infection, dueto advances in treatment, health practitioners must consider theimplications of anogenital HPV infection in HIV-positive women.
A study of women in four US cities found that 60–70% ofHIV-positive women tested positive for HPV, making them 2.3times more likely to be infected than HIV-negative women. Theywere also 1.9 times more likely to be infected with multiple HPVstrains, and 1.6 times more likely to have a higher HPV viralload [172].
Women with HIV were also more likely to have persistent infectionswith HPV; immunosuppression appears to play an important role inmodulating the natural history of HPV infections [173].
Palefsky et al looked specifically at HR-HPV types in HIV-positivewomen, finding a prevalence of 20–34% with an OR of 5.1compared with HIV-negative women [174].
Immunosuppression in HIV is monitored through the CD4 count. Alower T-cell count is closely related to likelihood of infectionwith HPV, including high-risk types, a high viral load, andpersistence of the infection [172–174].
A number of studies have demonstrated that the prevalence ofcervical cellular abnormalities is significantly higher inHIV-positive women [175–179].
Most cytological abnormalities are ASCUS and low-grade SIL, withhigh-grade lesions diagnosed in less than 10%.
Again, risk of cervical disease is greater when HPV load is high[180] and when immunosuppression is severe [176, 177].The significance of HIV viral load is lessconsistent—Massad et al observed no significant effect[177], yet in Duerr et al study the OR was 7.5[176].
Infection with HIV increases the incidence of SIL, almostcertainly because HIV-positive women are more likely thanHIV-negative women to have persistent infections with HR-HPV. Aprospective study showed that one in five HIV-positive women withno evidence of cervical disease developed biopsy-confirmed SILswithin 3 years [181].
Four studies [175, 177, 178, 182] have attempted to determinewhether cervical disease is less likely to regress in HIV-positivewomen than in those who are not infected. The studies useddifferent measures and endpoints, and so cannot be directlycompared; however, studies by Massad and Schuman demonstratedsignificant HIV-related differences in the likelihood of cervicaldisease regression.
Three studies [175, 177, 178] have shown significantdifferences between HIV-positive women and those without HIV, inprogression of cervical disease from LSIL to more advancedcervical disease.
By maintaining CD4 levels, HAART may impact on the natural historyof cervical disease in HIV-positive women. However, results of studies are mixed. Women on HAART were found to be more likely to experience regression of HPV-linkeddisease in three studies [180, 183, 184] while Mooreand Chaisson found no effect on CIN prevalence followingantiretroviral therapy [185]. In monitoring cervical disease progression, Lillo et al believed it was independent of HIVtreatment [186], while Minkoff et al saw a decreased likelihood for disease progression (OR 0.68) in women on HAART[183].
When HIV-positive women are treated surgically for CIN, they aremore likely to experience recurrence of disease than HIV-negativewomen. Cited recurrence rates have ranged from 39% to 56%,regardless of CIN severity or the mode of treatment (excisionversus ablation). The prime factor influencing rates of recurrenceis the level of immunodeficiency. Recurrence is halved in women onHAART. The conclusion was that although surgery is highlyeffective for immunocompetent patients, it only preventsprogression to cancer in HIV-positive women [187]. Disease recurrence should be anticipated in immunocompromised patients.
Case reports of invasive cervical cancers in patients with AIDSled the CDC to include cervical cancer as an AIDS-defining illnessin 1993 [188, 189].
The risk of ICC among HIV-positive women means that more frequenttesting is justified. In a prospective preventative study,six-monthly testing was undertaken in women with CIN1 lesions.These infrequently progressed in women with HIV, so observationappears safe, in the absence of other indications for treatment[190]. In a Swiss study, HIV-positive women had a higherlevel of cervical cancer than HIV-negative women (standardisedincidence ratio [SIR] = 8.0); however, unlike some otherAIDS-related cancers (Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma),HAART did not have a statistically significant impact on ICCincidence [191].
Women with HIV are more likely to experience VIN than HIV-negativewomen (4.67 versus 1.31/100 person years) [190]. Incident VIN is more common among women who have cervical lesions.
HIV-positive women are also at a higher risk for both invasive andin situ vulvar cancers (relative risk = 5.8 versus 3.9)[192]. Younger women (< 30 years of age) appear to have aneven higher risk.
Anal HPV infection is frequent (76%) in HIV-positive women[193]. Prevalence of AIN is also high (26%), particularlywhen immunodeficiency is severe (CD4 < 200 mm3) andcervical disease is also present [194]. A European study also reported the high risk of anal cancer among HIV-positive women(SIR = 18.5) [191].
Because the Pap test has a 10–25% false-negative rateirrespective of HIV status, LBC may provide higher sensitivitythan standard cytology. HPV testing may be undertaken at the timeof the swab, and should certainly be used to review ASCUS samples.
In HIV-positive women, more frequent screening is recommended ifHPV infection is known, there has been a previous abnormal smear,if CD4 < 200, or following any surgical treatment for cervicallesions.
Colposcopy should be used routinely in all HIV-positive women witha known HIV-positive status, if immunosuppressed (CD4 < 200) andfollowing an abnormal Pap smear [195]. The entire lower genital tract should be reviewed and biopsies taken. Followingsurgical treatment for cervical lesions, four-monthly colposcopyis recommended.
Because colposcopy is a subjective science and prone tofalse-negatives and -positives, biopsies should be consideredearly on in the evolution of any abnormality.
Anal Pap smears have not been adopted in the USA. High-resolutionanoscopy can be considered, and any abnormal areas sampled.
Vulvo-vaginal treatments for HPV-related lesions vary in efficacy.Even in immunocompetent patients efficacy ranges are broad(20–80%). The overall response to many treatments is likely tobe lower in HIV-positive patients, and recurrence is 3.3 timesmore frequent.
In the case of AIN, treatment decisions are based on size of thelesion, its location, and grade of histology. In managing theselesions in HIV-positive women, the least aggressive approach ispreferred. Radiation therapy should be avoided in the absence ofinvasive cancer.
Treatment of CIN and AIN should not be modified for patients onHAART, nor should antiretroviral therapy be instituted or modifiedas part of treatment.
The primary goal for Thailand is to reduce cervical cancer andmortality by detecting disease early, and treating it before itprogresses to invasive cancer.
Thailand has ∼15 million women at risk for cervicalcancer, only 5% of whom have been screened in the previous 5years via the Pap smear campaign. A major problem is the shortageof trained cytopathologists to examine Pap smears, and limitedresources to followup women with positive Pap test results.
In considering an alternative to conventional cytology, social andlogistical in addition to medical challenges need to be met. Keycomponents to be addressed includeoutreach and education—to increase demandand enhance coverage,advocacy and policy—to ensure support for the programme,training,service delivery system—to ensure women haveaccess to screening and treatment that are acceptable to them andsustainable over time,a referral system—for women with advanced disease,information management—to monitor progress,equipment procurement, repair, and maintenance.A single-visit approach to cervical cancer prevention, linkingscreening and treatment, is appropriate for low-resource settings.This can be implemented at the lowest level of the health system,can be performed by trained nonphysicians, requires fewmaterials, and is relatively inexpensive. This approach alsoavoids the delay of sending specimens away for testing.

VIA is now established as a safe, effective, viable alternative tocytology-based screening for low resource settings. Cryotherapyusing a CO2-based system can be offered to any woman with abnormalities at the time of the screening. There may not be aconfirmed pathological diagnosis, but it is the intervention,rather than the diagnosis, that will prevent cervical cancer.Thus, although VIA may not be the most accurate test, it is themost efficient way to provide preventative services to themajority of women at risk.
The major advantage is cost savings. A single visit approach islikely to be more effective and more cost-effective than multiplevisit strategies. A once-in-lifetime test for all women couldreduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality by up to 25%,dependent on coverage and age groups targeted. Good outcomes havebeen achieved in settings with a high prevalence of HIV[196–198].
In 1999, a trial project based on the single visit approach wasinitiated in Roi Et province. The safe, acceptability, feasibility(SAFE) project was very successful. Three in four targeted womenpresented to hospital and mobile clinics in the first 12 weeks,exceeding recruitment goals (Figure 6).
Trained and motivated nurses screened 5999 women over 6 months;13% were positive with VIA and offered treatment.
Following their experience with SAFE, treated women were surveyed;< 2% felt they were not adequately informed about thetreatment, or were not satisfied about their decision to betreated. Most importantly, 96.6% said they would recommendthe service to friends and family.
After screening or treatment, 4.9% of women presented again.Only 2.7% of visits concerned a minor complication such asvaginitis, cervicitis, or cramping, and there were no majorcomplications.
Efforts are now focused on training more local nurses in VIA andcryotherapy. By May 2005, ∼ 100 000 women 30–45 yearsof age had been tested with VIA, and 8–10% were offeredtreatment with cryotherapy. Ten Thai provinces have now adoptedthe single visit approach to screening.
Four key actions have contributed to the success of the singlevisit approach in Thailand.Recognition of the importance of linking testingto treatment.Use of competency-based training methods to prepareservice providers, clinical supervisors, and master trainers.Use of mobile and static clinics for servicedelivery, ensuring easier access for women.Communication to build national consensusand support for the programme.

Four key areas will contribute to global cancer levels in comingdecades:oncological infectious agents, that is, HBV, HPV, HIV,Epstein Barr virus, schistosomes, and Helicobacter pylori,carcinogens, most notably tobacco,lifestyle changes, particularly growingobesity and decreased exercise and physical fitness,changing age structure in many societies—smallerfamilies and longer life-spans mean that cancer, generally adisease of old age, will grow in prevalence.

Cancer control is a continuum where improved outcomes canbe achieved at many different levels:prevention,screening/diagnosis,treatment,symptom management and health-related qualityof life leading to prolonged survival,end-of-life care.A number of global organisations are working with national andlocal groups to develop cancer control programmes that involvestakeholders at all levels, are appropriate to the patientpopulation, and are achievable and sustainable.

Organisations that have publicly stated their commitment to cancercontrol include the WHO IARC, World Charter Against Cancer 2000,WHO World Health Assembly, and the International Union AgainstCancer.
The Global Initiative on Women's Cancer (GLOW) has identifiedthree areas of focus—gynaecological cancer (especiallycervical), breast cancer, and tobacco control.
GLOW supports a number of initiatives for cervical cancer and isdeveloping appropriate guidelines for their adoption:prevention with prophylactic HPV vaccines,screening,new diagnostic tests,treatments to cure or prolong survival,Palliative care.Another key focus for GLOW is education through publications,websites, meetings, and satellite symposia at majorobstetrics/gynaecology and oncology meetings. GLOW can alsoprovide technical expertise in planning, implementation, andevaluation of cervical control programmes.
