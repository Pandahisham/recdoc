SOME TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS IN MAN

 The value of µ = 29,400 has been found for the human heart beat over the temperature range of approximately 4.7°C. This value is different from that of 24,000 calories which has been obtained for the effect of temperature on judgments of short durations. The evidence indicates that the estimation of short time intervals is controlled by a chemical master reaction which is independent of the pulse rhythm.
