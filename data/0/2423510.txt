A series of plasma globulin studies was carried out on 108 patients who were operated on for splenictrauma during the last 3 years. The reasons for splenectomy or spleen salvage were; gunshot woundsin 22 patients (20.3%); stab injuries in 10 patients (9.2%) and blunt abdominal trauma in 76 patients(70.3%). Plasma gamma globulin determinations were made on the 8th postoperative day and at 3months. In the splenectomy group; plasma gamma globulin determinations demonstrated a significantreduction in serum IgM levels (p < 0.001) but no significant changes in IgA and IgG levels (p > 0.05).No changes were detected in IgA, IgG and IgM levels in the spleen salvage group (p > 0.05).
We believe that the preservation of the traumatized spleen should be the prime aim of surgeons.
