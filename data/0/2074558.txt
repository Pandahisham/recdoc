Follow-up of bone lesions in an experimental multiple myeloma mouse model: description of an in vivo technique using radiography dedicated for mammography.

The evolution of bone lesions in transplantable C57BL/KaLwRjj 5T mouse myeloma (MM) has been followed in vivo. Mice were anaesthetised and a radiograph of the pelvis and hind legs was performed by a radiograph dedicated for mammography. This is the first description of an in vivo technique under experimental conditions whereby the development of bone lesions owing to the MM growth was demonstrated.
