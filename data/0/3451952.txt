Due to their localisationsand symptoms, interhemisphericsubdural haematomas (ISH) composea distinct category. Alteredlevel of consciousness and hemiparesisare the most frequent symptoms.We report a case of ISH whopresented with headache as the solecomplaint. Left cerebellarhaematoma and ISH were found incranial MRI and cranial computedtomography Cranial MR angiogramwas normal. Haemogram and coagulationparameters were within normallimits. ISH should be consideredamong the diagnostic possibilitiesin elderly patients who presentwith headache as the sole symptomwithout other clinical features suchas meningeal irritation signs, focalneurological symptoms and alterationof consciousness. Cranialimaging studies should be done insuch cases.
