Allure of dice

This poem paints the picture of a gambling addict who narrates his story in the course of a psychiatric consultation.

Dad gambled
He lost, he lost
His life ruined, chasing the Win
Didn’t live to see one
Drowned in debt, doomed to melancholy
He went early, or did he?
For he left me hooked, left a fractured home
Lost my teens in arcades, in pubs
Small stakes to start, soon sunk deep
Casinos, online and racetracks it were to be
Higher and higher stakes
I risked all; gambling's allure, beyond all senses
It seizes like no drug, drink, or sex
A grip so firm, you at its mercy
Yet the rush a win brings
Overrides all the lows, before and after
A vice, some say
A violent lover, I say
Love her or hate her
Can’t part ways
For we are meant to be
Come night, I dream of cards, dice, and roulette
Come morning, crave my first fix
Win or lose, never home before midnight
I lost all
Yet like a moth to flame, I drift
I know I should quit, but can’t
What more is there to lose?
One big win and I’ll quit
It’s so near, I see it.
