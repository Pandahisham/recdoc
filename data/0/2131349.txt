STUDIES IN THE COMMON COLD 

 1. A study of the Gram-negative, filter-passing, anaerobic organisms, described by Olitsky and Gates, and Gates and McCartney, has been undertaken with a view to determining their general character and their possible r√¥le in the causation of the common cold. 2. These organisms seem to constitute part of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract and would seem to bear no etiological relationship to the common cold.
