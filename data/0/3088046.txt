Seven new species within western Atlantic Starksia atlantica, S. lepicoelia, and S. sluiteri (Teleostei, Labrisomidae), with comments on congruence of DNA barcodes and species

Academic editor: Nina Bogutskaya
Specimens of Starksia were collected throughout the western Atlantic, and a 650-bp portion of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase-c subunit I (COl) was sequenced as part of a re-analysis of species diversity of western Central Atlantic shorefishes. A neighbor-joining tree constructed from the sequence data suggests the existence of several cryptic species. Voucher specimens from each genetically distinct lineage and color photographs of vouchers taken prior to dissection and preservation were examined for diagnostic morphological characters. The results suggest that Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri are species complexes, and each comprises three or more species. Seven new species are described. DNA data usually support morphological features, but some incongruence between genetic and morphological data exists. Genetic lineages are only recognized as species if supported by morphology. Genetic lineages within western Atlantic Starksia generally correspond to geography, such that members of each species complex have a very restricted geographical distribution. Increasing geographical coverage of sampling locations will almost certainly increase the number of Starksia species and species complexes recognized in the western Atlantic. Combining molecular and morphological investigations is bringing clarity to the taxonomy of many genera of morphologically similar fishes and increasing the number of currently recognized species. Future phylogenetic studies should help resolve species relationships and shed light on patterns of speciation in western Atlantic Starksia.

The description of six new species of Caribbean Starksia by Williams and Mounts (2003) capped more than 100 years of systematic research on this New World labrisomid genus. It would have been reasonable to assume after such effort that there is little about the group left to discover. But the utilization of modern DNA barcoding techniques in taxonomic studies is revealing the need to reanalyze existing species classifications of many groups of animals and, in combination with traditional morphological analyses, resulting in the recognition of numerous new species (e.g., Crawford et al. 2010, Hebert et al. 2004, Pauls et al. 2010, Pöppe et al. 2010, Ward et al. 2008, Zemlak et al. 2009). Western Atlantic shorefishes are no exception (e.g., Tornabene et al. 2010; Victor 2007, 2010). Particularly for small cryptic reef fishes such as Starksia blennies, we do not know where we stand in terms of understanding species diversity, and our current concepts may be surprisingly incomplete.
Starksia fishes inhabit shallow to moderately deep (to ca. 30 m) rock and coral reefs in the western Central Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans. They are small (Atlantic species are generally < 40 mm SL) and cryptic, but they often exhibit bright orange or red coloration in life. Twenty-one species are currently recognized in the western Atlantic (Williams and Mounts 2003), six of which are considered members of the Starksia ocellata species complex (Greenfield 1979).
The purpose of this paper is to describe the systematic results of our recent genetic and morphological investigations of western Atlantic Starksia, work that was prompted by our discovery of incongruences between preliminary genetic data and the current species classification. We describe seven new species within Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri and provide keys to the species of each of those species complexes. We provide photographs of living and preserved pigment patterns to help in future identifications of the included species and in distinguishing them from western Atlantic Starksia species likely to be discovered in the future. Finally, we discuss geographical distributions of Starksia species and comment on congruence between DNA barcoding data and morphologically recognizable species.
Specimens used in this study were collected from Barbados, Belize, Bahamas, Curacao (Netherland Antilles), Florida, Honduras, Panama (Atlantic), Saba Bank (Netherland Antilles), St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands), Tobago (Trinidad and Tobago), and Turks and Caicos. That material and additional museum specimens examined are listed in the appropriate species and comparisons sections. Starksia specimens included in the genetic analysis but not in the species accounts are tabulated in Appendix 1. Institutional abbreviations for collections follow Sabaj Pérez (2010).
Specimens were collected with quinaldine sulfate, rotenone, or clove oil using snorkel gear or scuba depending on depth. Field protocol involved taking digital color photographs of fresh color patterns and subsequently a tissue sample (muscle, eye, or fin clip) for genetic analysis. For many, particularly small specimens, it was necessary to remove the posterior 1/3 to 1/2 of the body to obtain enough tissue for genetic analysis. Voucher specimens were preserved and later used to investigate diagnostic morphological features of each recovered genetic lineage. Field measurements of standard length (SL), to the nearest 0.5 mm, were made by viewing specimens against a plastic ruler under a dissecting microscope. Lengths of voucher specimens generally were not re-measured in the lab because many vouchers are now incomplete specimens. Those that were measured in the lab were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm with digital calipers or with the aid of an ocular micrometer in a dissecting microscope. Lengths of head (HL) and genital papilla were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm with the same ocular micrometer and microscope. To ensure that we were not introducing bias due to shrinkage of specimens after preservation, head length as a percentage of SL was calculated only for specimens in which both measurements were made from preserved specimens. Counts of dorsal-, anal-, and caudal-fin rays were made from digital radiographs of specimens, from preserved specimens, or from photographs of voucher specimens taken prior to dissection. We followed Böhlke and Springer (1961) in counting the last two segmented rays of the dorsal and anal fins separately. Lateral-line scales were not counted because too many scales are missing on most specimens. This is likely due to the long time the specimens were held for processing prior to preservation and the physical manipulation of the specimens during processing. Pores from the circumorbital ossifications are either uniserial or paired; the positions of any paired pores are described based on their position relative to the orbit as though it were a clock; on the left side, for example, a pair of pores at 3 o’clock is on the posterior margin of the orbit, a pair at 6 o’clock is on the ventral margin.
Molecular techniques employed at the Smithsonian are as described below. Methods utilized to sequence DNA from specimens from Barbados, Honduras, Panama, and St. Thomas are as outlined in Victor (2010). Tissue samples for molecular work were stored in saturated salt buffer (Seutin et al. 1990) or in 95% ethanol. Genomic DNA was extracted from up to approximately 20 mg minced preserved tissue via an automated phenol:chloroform extraction on the Autogenprep965 (Autogen, Holliston, Massachusetts) using the mouse tail tissue protocol with a final elution volume of 50 µL. For polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1 µL of this genomic DNA was used in a 10 µL reaction with 0.5 U Bioline (BioLine USA, Boston, Massachusetts) Taq polymerase, 0.4 µL 50 mM MgCl2, 1 µL 10× buffer, 0.5 µL 10 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), and 0.3 µL 10 µM each primer FISH-BCL (5’-TCAACYAATCAYAAAGATATYGGCAC) and FISH-BCH (5’-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA). The thermal cycler program for PCR was 1 cycle of 5 min at 95°C; 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 52°C, and 45 s at 72°C; 1 cycle of 5 min at 72°C; and a hold at 10°C. The PCR products were purified with Exosap-IT (USB, Cleveland, OH) using 2 µL 0.2× enzyme and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was then inactivated for 20 min at 80°C. Sequencing reactions were performed using 1 µL of this purified PCR product in a 10 µL reaction containing 0.5 µL primer, 1.75 µL BigDye buffer, and 0.5 µL BigDye (ABI, Foster City, California) and run in the thermal cycler for 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 50°C, 4 min at 60°C, and then held at 10°C. These sequencing reactions were purified using Millipore Sephadex plates (MAHVN-4550; Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) per manufacturer’s instructions and stored dry until analyzed. Sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI 3730XL automated DNA sequencer, and sequence trace files were exported into Sequencher 4.7 (GeneCodes, Ann Arbor, MI). Using the Sequencher program, ends were trimmed from the raw sequences until the first and last 10 bases contained fewer than 5 base calls with a confidence score (phred score) lower than 30. After trimming, forward and reverse sequences for each specimen were assembled. Each assembled pair was examined and edited by hand, and each sequence was checked for stop codons. Finally the consensus sequence (655 bp) from each contig was aligned and exported in a nexus format (sensu Swofford 2002).
A neighbor-joining tree (Saitou and Nei 1987) and distance matrix were generated using Paup*4.1 (Swofford 2002) on an analysis of Kimura two-parameter distances (Kimura 1980). The neighbor-joining tree is not intended to reflect phylogenetic relationships. The labels for each entry on the tree is our DNA number, and we include that number in the material examined sections and figure captions. Abbreviations used in DNA numbers reflect geographical location: BAH – Bahamas, BAR – Barbados, BLZ – Belize, BRZ – Brazil, CUR – Curacao, FLA – Florida, HON – Honduras, PAN – Panama, SAB – Saba Bank (Netherland Antilles), STVI – St. Thomas Virgin Islands, TCI – Turks and Caicos, TOB – Tobago. COI sequences are deposited in Genbank (accession numbers HQ543038-HQ543055, HQ571151-HQ571164, HQ600864-HQ600963).
A neighbor-joining tree derived from western Atlantic Starksia COl sequences is shown in Fig. 1. Thirteen of the 21 currently recognized western Atlantic Starksia species are represented in the tree: Starksia atlantica, Starksia culebrae, Starksia elongata, Starksia fasciata, Starksia guttata, Starksia hassi, Starksia lepicoelia, Starksia multilepis, Starksia nanodes, Starksia occidentalis, Starksia ocellata, Starksia sluiteri, and Starksia starcki. Four species, Starksia culebrae from the U.S. Virgin Islands, S. guttata from Tobago, Starksia occidentalis from Belize, and Starksia ocellata from Florida, cluster on the tree but represent genetically distinct lineages. Those results support Greenfield’s (1979) recognition of a Starksia ocellata species complex with several allopatric component species. Similarly, Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, Starksia nanodes, and Starksia sluiteri comprise multiple, geographically distinct, genetic lineages, suggesting that they also represent species complexes comprising multiple allopatric species. We do not deal further with the Starksia nanodes complex in this paper because no genetic data is available from the type locality, Bahamas, and we are thus uncertain if any of the four genetic lineages on the tree (Barbados, Belize, Panama, and Saba Bank) represents Starksia nanodes Böhlke & Springer 1961. We also do not deal further with five species, Starksia elongata, Starksia fasciata, Starksia hassi, Starksia multilepis, and Starksia starcki (but see discussion of Starksia fasciata under the Starksia sluiteri complex section). Each of those speciesis represented in our material from only one geographical location, and material from additional geographic locations is needed to determine if they represent species complexes. We note that our material of Starksia elongata, Starksia fasciata, Starksia hassi, and Starksia multilepis is from the type localities of those species or relatively close by; the type locality of Starksia starcki, however, is Florida, and our specimen is from Belize.
The multiple genetic lineages within Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri are the focus of the species treatments below. For each complex, we discuss congruence of the component genetic lineages with results of our morphological investigation. When diagnostic morphological features (primarily pigment) support the genetic data, we recognize genetic lineages as species. Greenfield (1979) noted that the ability to identify individuals of the Starksia ocellata complex to species based on morphology without prior knowledge of locality supports the recognition of the component populations as species vs. subspecies. We concur, and believe that the addition of the COl data strengthens this argument. There are no available names for new species within any of Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri complexes, and the seven unnamed species discovered are described herein as new. Keys to the species of the Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri complexes are provided. We suggest that readers use the taxonomic key to western Atlantic Starksia provided by Williams and Mounts (2003) to identify Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri and the keys in this paper to distinguish the members within each complex. Note that the sixth couplet of the Williams and Mounts (2003) key contains an error: 6b should lead the user to couplet 10, not 9 as indicated. The geographical locations listed for each species in our keys are the type locality plus any additional localities for which we have genetic data. Additional collecting and study are needed to determine the distributions of all western Atlantic Starksia species. Distance matrices for intra- and interspecific variation in COl sequences for the Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri species complexes are provided in tables within the text. A distance matrix for all lineages is in Appendix 2.
Longley (1934) described Starksia atlantica from a single specimen from Andros Island, Bahamas. The neighbor-joining tree derived from COI sequences (Fig. 1) includes five distinct genetic lineages in the Starksia atlantica complex. The lineages from Barbados (BAR) and Panama (PAN) are known only from larvae or juveniles and are not discussed further. The Panama lineage is highly divergent in COl, and it likely represents a cryptic species within Starksia atlantica or one of the eight western Atlantic Starksia species not identified in our material. The other three lineages—Curacao (CUR), Saba Bank (SAB), and Bahamas/Turks and Caicos/Belize (BAH/TCI/BLZ) comprise specimens originally identified as Starksia atlantica on the basis of absence of an orbital cirrus. (Note: Williams and Mounts (2003) correctly noted the absence of an orbital cirrus as diagnostic for Starksia atlantica in their key to western Atlantic Starksia [p. 147], but they erroneously stated “orbital cirri present” intheir treatment of the species [p. 160].) Within the BAH/TCI/BLZ lineage, there are three sublineages, two from Belize and one from Bahamas/Turks & Caicos Islands (or four if the latter is viewed as two). We have identified the specimens from Bahamas and Turks and Caicos as Starksia atlantica (Longley) based on the type locality (Bahamas) and pigment pattern, specifically the presence of two or three rows of block-like blotches on the trunk that are irregular in size and shape (Böhlke and Springer 1961). We found no consistent differences between specimens from the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.
The two Belize sublineages differ from other members of the Starksia atlantica complex by the presence of regular, vertical, brown bars on the trunk separated by narrow white interspaces and a well-defined horseshoe-shaped blotch on the cheek. Although those two sublineages are genetically similar to Starksia atlantica, we recognize the two lineages from Belize as a distinct species based on their strikingly different pigment pattern and geographic separation. We found no consistent morphological variation between the two Belize sublineages and treat them as a single new species. Two specimens of this new species were illustrated as Starksia atlantica by Greenfield and Johnson (1981: Fig. 3A,B), who noted consistent differences in pigmentation on the body between their material from Belize and Honduras and the description of pigmentation for Starksia atlantica by Böhlke and Springer (1961). The other two genetic lineages of Starksia atlantica (Fig. 1) are from Curacao (CUR) and Saba Bank (SAB). The Curacao specimens have a distinctive pattern of pigment on the cheek and pectoral-fin base, and we recognize them as a distinct species. The single sequence from Saba Bank likely represents a new species (Fig. 1), but additional material is needed to confidently assess its status (see “Remarks” under “Starksia sp.” below). We describe two new species within the Starksia atlantica complex, Starksia sangreyae from Belize and Starksia springeri from Curacao.

* Indicates count of holotype1 Longley (1934) did not provide counts of pectoral-fin rays or vertebrae for the holotype of Starksia atlantica
Specimens examined ranging from 12.0 to 19.0 mm SL; HL 29–34% SL (31% in holotype); male genital papilla adhered to first anal spine proximally; papilla length between two-thirds and three-quarters length of first anal spine, 0.6–1.0 mm; some females with very small genital papilla.
Vertical brown bars present on trunk separated by narrow white interspaces; anteriormost 6 bars relatively uniform in all specimens; posterior bars often irregular or incompletely formed. A thick horseshoe-shaped blotch of pigment present on cheek. Bright orange pigment present on distal portions of pectoral-fin rays, and pale orange pigment usually present on distal portions of posterior anal-, caudal-, and soft dorsal-fin rays. Color pattern sexually dimorphic: males with pale red heads (vs. females without red coloration); relatively poorly defined horseshoe-shaped blotch of pigment on cheek that fades posteriorly (well-defined horseshoe-shaped blotch on cheek that is sometimes mirrored on operculum and pectoral fin base); body bars tan and usually with some gold or green color in life (darker and without green/gold color but some posterior bars often with some orange pigment); body bars usually terminating ventrally dorsal to ventral midline (body bars usually extending to ventral midline); blotches of tan/gold pigment on base of dorsal fin associated with body bars, and no tan/gold color present on anal fin (bright orange markings on base of dorsal fin associated with body bars and several bright orange spots on base of anal fin); and large dark spot, roughly diameter of pupil or larger, on trunk at posterior end of dorsal fin (two large dark spots on trunk, one at posterior end of dorsal fin similar in size to that of males, and smaller spot at posterior end of anal fin).
Vertical bars on trunk, horseshoe-shaped blotch of pigment on cheek, and spot at posterior end of dorsal fin (and anal fin in females) retained in preservative; margins of at least some body bars in females with small dark spots; prominent patches of melanophores on jaws and gular region, and scattered pigment (heavier in females) on rest of head; dorsal fin ranging from overall dusky to having concentrations of pigment on base of fin associated with body bars; caudal fin with light pigment on outer rays, and pectoral fin with scattered melanophores over entire fin; pelvic fin clear.
The species name is in honor of Mary Sangrey for her many years of work coordinating the intern program at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. Mary brought the intern application of the second author to the first author’s attention and took the first steps toward procuring funding for Castillo’s internship.
All material that we examined is from Belize. The range of the species also apparently includes Honduras, as Greenfield and Johnson (1981) noted that a specimen of Starksia atlantica from Honduras has regular vertical bars of pigment on the body.

(Saba): SABA-06-01, 15.0 mm SL (no voucher).Photographs by Carole Baldwin, Cristina Castillo, Donald Griswold, Julie Mounts, Ross Robertson, James Van Tassell, and Jeffrey Williams.
Specimens examined ranging from 12.0 to 19.0mm SL; HL 25–32% SL (32% in holotype); genital-papilla length in 15.0-mm SL paratype 0.3 mm, one-fourth length of first anal spine (broken); papilla adhered to spine proximally. Note: the presence of a small but measurable genital papilla on 15.0-mm SL paratype suggests that it is a male: although female Starksia sometimes have a small genital papilla, the 19 mm female holotype does not. As noted below, the 15 mm paratype has a pupil-size dark spot at posterior base of anal fin, which usually characterizes females. We tentatively recognize this paratype as a male.
(Note: a field photograph of the 12.0-mm SL paratype is a dorsal view of poor quality, and only the head remains as a preserved voucher. The following description is based on the 15.0-mm SL paratype and the 19.0-mm SL holotype.) Trunk with irregular dark blotches on pale background, most blotches consisting of orange chromatophores and melanophores in paratype; two dark spots present on trunk, large one at posterior end of dorsal fin (larger than pupil diameter) and smaller spot at posterior end of anal fin. Paratype with pale orange and brown pigment on head; tips of jaws with dark pigment in both paratype and holotype, but rest of jaws and gular region distinctly barred in holotype, mottled with tiny spots in paratype; cheek with distinctive dark and pale markings: anterior portion of cheek with prominent dark blotch, its anteroventral and posterior margins well defined by pale regions; posterior pale area on cheek bordered posteriorly by thin, dark, anteroventral-to-posterodorsal streak of pigment along distal edge of preopercle. Bright orange markings present on bases of dorsal fin and anal fins, sometimes occurring in pairs; bright orange pigment also present on distal portions of pectoral-fin rays; pale orange pigment present distally on at least some rays of soft dorsal, caudal, and anal fins; pectoral-fin base with relatively pale gap separating two dark blotches, margins of gap relatively straight; dark blotches on pectoral-fin base comprising orange chromatophores and melanophores.
(Note: pigmentation on trunk in preservative based on the only entire specimen, female holotype.) Trunk with irregular dark blotches on pale background; spots at posterior ends of dorsal and anal fins retained in preservative. Dark markings on head described above retained in preservative, mottled jaws and gular region of male(?) paratype strikingly different from barred markings on female holotype; top of head in both specimens covered with scattered melanophores; dark and pale regions on cheek and pectoral-fin base retained in preservative. Anal and pectoral fins with lightly scattered melanophores; caudal fin with light pigment on outer rays; pelvic fin clear.
Named in honor of Victor G. Springer, Senior Scientist Emeritus, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, for his contributions to the systematics of blennioid fishes, including Starksia, and for advice and friendship he has bestowed upon the first author.

SABA-06–25, 9.0 mm female (not a DNA voucher), near Coral Garden at SE edge of Saba Bank, Netherland Antilles, 17°21.10'N, 63°15.08'W, 15–18 m, 4 Jan 2006; photograph: 15.1 mm SL female (not a DNA voucher), sta. SABA-06-01, Saba Bank just south of Poison Bank, Netherland Antilles, 17°28.47'N, 63°13.40'W, 24–27 m, 4 Jan 2006 (photographs by Jeffrey T. Williams).
A DNA sequence from a single specimen collected at Saba Bank (Netherland Antilles) is genetically distinct from the other members of the Starksia atlantica species complex (SAB 0601019, Fig. 1). Our material includes color photographs of 9.0- and 15.1-mm SL females and the preserved 9.0 mm specimen (USNM 388032). Presumably the 9.0 and 15.1 mm specimens are the same species as the specimen represented on the tree, but we do not have tissue samples of either for genetic analysis or a preserved voucher of SAB 0601019 for morphological analysis.
Trunk pigment in the images and preserved specimen is similar to that of Starksia atlantica from the Bahamas and Starksia springeri from Curacao (i.e., mottled vs. barred as in Starksia sangreyae), but the Saba specimens lack the horseshoe-shaped blotch of pigment on the cheek characteristic of Starksia atlantica and the distinctive dark and pale markings on the cheek of Starksia springeri. The blotches of trunk pigment in the Saba Bank specimens are neither conspicuously block-like nor clearly organized in horizontal tiers as they are in Starksia atlantica. Specimens from Saba Bank presumably represent another new species within Starksia atlantica, but additional specimens are needed for comparative purposes and description.

Members of the Starksia atlantica complex are diagnosed by the absence of an orbital cirrus. Starksia sangreyae is distinct in having regular vertical body bars separated by narrow pale interspaces and a well-defined horseshoe-shaped blotch on the cheek. Starksia springeri, Starksia atlantica, and the specimens from Saba Bankhave irregular dark blotches on a pale background on the trunk, the blotches better defined in our Starksia atlantica material than in the other species and often more clearly arranged in two or three horizontal tiers. Starksia springeri, Starksia atlantica, and the Saba Bank specimens can be distinguished on the basis of pigment patterns on the cheek: specimens from Saba Bank lack cheek blotches; Starksia atlantica has a horseshoe-shaped blotch on the cheek; and Starksia springeri has a prominent dark blotch on the cheek bordered anteroventrally and posteriorly by pale areas and a thin, dark, anteroventral-to-posterodorsal streak of pigment along the distal edge of the preopercle. Although Starksia sangreyae and Starksia atlantica are easily separated based on trunk pigment, we note that both have a horseshoe-shaped blotch of pigment on the cheek; the blotch is most prominent and best defined in Starksia sangreyae females, often completely faded in preserved Starksia sangreyae males. Starksia atlantica and Starksia springeri can be separated based on pigment on the pectoral-fin base: in Starksia atlantica, the pale gap between two blotches of darker pigment has wavy margins, whereas in Starksia springeri, the margins of the pale gap are relatively straight. Starksia springeri has XVIII dorsal spines vs. usually XIX in the other species (Table 1), but we have only one entire specimen of Starksia springeri on which to base counts. No other significant differences were found in numbers of fin rays or vertebrae among species of the Starksia atlantica complex.
A photograph of a specimen identified as Starksia atlantica from St. Croix, U. S. Virgin Islands (taken by William Smith-Vaniz) shows irregular block-like blotches on the body arranged in roughly 3 horizontal tiers, wavy margins on the pale gap that separates two darker areas on the pectoral-fin base, and an irregular horseshoe-shaped blotch of pigment on the cheek. The U.S. Virgin Islands are thus likely part of the geographical distribution of Starksia atlantica Longley. Several USNM specimens identified as Starksia atlantica from Navassa Island exhibit pigmentation that is somewhat intermediate between that of Starksia atlantica and Starksia sangreyae: bars of pigment are present on the trunk anteriorly as in Starksia sangreyae, but trunk pigment is more block-like posteriorly as in Starksia atlantica; Navassa specimens also have an irregular horseshoe-shaped blotch on the cheek as in Starksia atlantica. Further genetic and morphological investigation should help clarify species issues of Starksia atlantica from Navassa Island.

Böhlke and Springer (1961) described Starksia lepicoelia on the basis of numerous specimens from the Bahamas and one from St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The presence of a simple cirrus above the eye, two externally obvious pelvic-fin rays, a completely scaled belly or at least posterior half scaled, and usually 17 anal-fin soft rays are diagnostic of the species. Six genetic lineages in our data set cluster in the Starksia lepicoelia complex (Fig. 1). There are no photographs or vouchers of the Barbados specimens (BAR on tree), and that lineage is not discussed further. Clearly it represents either a cryptic species within Starksia lepicoelia or one of the eight species of western Atlantic Starksia not identified in our material. Two of the Starksia lepicoelia lineages are from the Bahamas/Turks and Caicos (BAH/TCI), and although sequence divergence for the two is 4–6% -- much higher than typical intraspecific variation in western Atlantic Starksia – we were unable to find consistent morphological differences between them and tentatively recognize them together as Starksia lepicoelia (Fig. 6). A fourth genetic lineage comprises specimens from Belize (BLZ), and a fifth, specimens from Panama (PAN). Although those lineages differ by only about 1% sequence divergence in COl, they are easily distinguished by color pattern. We describe the specimens from Belize and Panama as two new species. A sixth genetic lineage is represented in our tree by a single specimen from Saba Bank, Netherland Antilles. Based on that specimen and several lots of non-voucher material, we recognize the Saba Bank population as a fourth species within the Starksia lepicoelia complex.

Starksia lepicoelia and Starksia starcki are the only previously described western Atlantic Starksia with the combination of an orbital cirrus, two externally obvious pelvic-fin rays, and a scaled belly (Williams and Mounts 2003). Starksia starcki is easily distinguished from the species of the Starksia lepicoelia complex by the presence of eight or nine irregular dark bars on the body and usually 19 segmented anal-fin rays.
In life, Starksia weigti is easily distinguished from Starksia lepicoelia, Starksia williamsi, and Starksia robertsoni by the conspicuous pale round spots on the lips. In preservative, Starksia lepicoelia males are distinctive in having at least some very dark spots, streaks, or bars on the lips and lower jaw, and Starksia robertsoni males have at least one (up to three) dark spots or bars on the ventral portion of the lower jaw (but not on the lips). Although the differences are subtle, preserved males of Starksia williamsi typically can be separated from preserved males of Starksia weigti in having the lips uniformly covered with melanophores except for the pale anterior tips. In Starksia weigti males, lip pigment is variable, but there are usually one or two thin, faint, poorly formed bars of pigment following the pale anterior portions of the lips; posteriorly, the lips may be uniformly covered with melanophores as in Starksia williamsi or be quite pale.
Preserved female Starksia lepicoelia also have a distinctive lip pattern—alternating pale and dark areas. Although this banding pattern appears to be present in color images of Starksia williamsi, Starksia weigti, and Starksia robertsoni, it is not present in preserved females of those species, suggesting that in Starksia lepicoelia the banding comprises both chromatophores and melanophores whereas in females of the other species it comprises only chromatophores and thus is not retained in preservative. As in males, differences in head pigment between preserved female Starksia williamsi and Starksia weigti are subtle, but Starksia williamsi females have a relatively well-formed bar of pigment from the anterior portion of the lacrimal across both lips, whereas Starksia weigti females typically have only a light scattering of melanophores on the upper lip beneath the anterior portion of the lacrimal. Additionally, Starksia williamsi females tend to have a bit of dark pigment at the posteroventral corner of the orbit and another bit just ventral to posteriormost point of orbit; Starksia weigti females usually have more widely scattered pigment on the cheek -- sometimes in a fairly cohesive spot. The head pigment of female Starksia robertsoni is very similar to that of Starksia williamsi, but modal differences in fin-ray counts separate them, and they are geographically distinct. Specifically, Starksia williamsi—from the eastern Caribbean—typically has XIX,8 dorsal-fin elements, whereas Starksia robertsoni—from Panama—typically has XX,7.
Modal differences in some counts also help separate other species: Starksia lepicoelia modally has 28 total dorsal-fin elements, 33 vertebrae, and 78 total dorsal elements + anal soft rays + vertebrae (vs. 32, 27, and 75, respectively, in Starksia williamsi and Starksia weigti). Starksia williamsi modally has XIX dorsal-fin spines, whereas Starksia lepicoelia and Starksia weigti modally have XX.
We examined color photographs and numerous preserved specimens from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, but we do not have genetic data for that material. Fresh specimens lack the diagnostic white spots on the lips of Starksia weigti. Preserved specimens most closely resemble Starksia lepicoelia in pattern of pigment on the lips and lower jaw, with females typically having at least some alternating pale and dark areas (nearly identical to that of Starksia lepicoelia in some specimens, not distinctive at all in others). Although most males have fairly uniform pigment on the lips and lower jaw, at least some males have the distinctive dark bars, spots, or streaks characteristic of male Starksia lepicoelia. If the St. Croix specimens represent one of the known Starksia lepicoelia species, it seems likely based on geography and pigmentation that they are Starksia lepicoelia. However, we note that Starksia lepicoelia typically has 28 total dorsal elements and 17 anal-fin soft rays, whereas the St. Croix specimens (15 counted) typically have 27 and 16, respectively (but 28 dorsal elements and 17 anal rays are not uncommon counts). Additional investigation, including genetic analysis, is needed.
Metzelaar (1919) described Brannerella sluiteri from two specimens from Bonaire, Netherland Antilles. Longley (1934) synonymized Brannerella with Starksia Jordan and Evermann (type species Labrisomus cremnobates Gilbert, from the eastern Pacific). Böhlke and Springer (1961) concurred with Longley’s synonymy, noting that Brannerella is distinctive in a single character, and generic recognition of one-character differences would require the erection of several new genera within Caribbean Starksia.
Our material includes three genetic lineages originally identified as Starksia sluiteri based on the taxonomic key of Williams and Mounts (2003) — one from Curacao, one from Tobago, and one from Belize/Honduras/Panama. Specimens in all three lineages modally have 13 pectoral-fin rays, 20 or fewer dorsal-fin spines, and two or three rows of dark spots or blotches along the body — features typical of Starksia sluiteri. We have identified our genetic lineage from Curacao (CUR in Fig. 1) as Starksia sluiteri (Metzelaar) based on geography and morphology. In particular, the second row of dark markings (middle row when there are three) are distinctly round in Starksia sluiteri and in our Curacao specimens, whereas those markings are usually vertically elongate in our specimens from Belize (BLZ), Honduras (HON), and Panama (PAN). Additionally, although Metzelaar (1919) illustrated a male specimen in his original description, he did not mention any round, pale markings on the head—prominent diagnostic features in males of our specimens from Tobago (TOB) that are lacking in our male Starksia sluiteri from Curacao. We recognize the genetic lineage from Tobago, as well as that from Belize/Honduras/Panama, as new species within the Starksia sluiteri complex and provide descriptions below.
Böhlke and Springer (1961) noted that counts of dorsal- and anal-fin elements in specimens of Starksia sluiteri they examined from off Colombia and Venezuela (XIX dorsal spines and 15–16 anal rays) differ from those given by Metzelaar (XX and 17). Based on pigment, their Colombian and Venezuelan specimens appear to be Starksia sluiteri. Our specimens from Curacao, as well as Böhlke and Springer’s two Venezuelan specimens (USNM 195750), have XIX dorsal spines and 15–16 anal rays. There is thus a discrepancy between counts in our material and those reported by Metzelaar for the holotype. We examined a photograph of the holotype, and there appear to be XX dorsal-fin spines as noted by Mezelaar; XX is likely a non-modal count for Starksia sluiteri. We note that there is more variation in dorsal- and anal-fin counts in some Starksia species than suggested by Metzelaar’s description; for example, Starksia greenfieldi has XVIII–XX dorsal spines, 7–9 dorsal rays, and 14–16 anal rays.

Frequency distributions of counts among species of the Starksia sluiteri complex1.
* Indicates count of holotype
1 Metzelaar (1919) did not provide counts of pectoral-fin rays or vertebrae for the holotype of Starksia sluiteri
Specimens examined ranging from 11.0–23.0 mm SL; HL 30–36% SL (36%); length of male genital papilla 19–26% SL in specimens 19.0 mm SL and larger (26%), 12–14% in specimens 15.0–17.0 mm SL; papilla adhered to first anal-fin spine and extending well beyond it, spine one-half length of papilla in most males, greater than three-quarters in smallest males.
Head and body pale yellow to pale orange, generally more orange in males, more yellow in females; posterior margins of most body scales covered with yellow or orange chromatophores mixed with melanophores, resulting in background pattern of chain-link or diamond-shaped markings. Two or three rows of dark markings on trunk in mature specimens, markings diffuse in some specimens: dorsalmost row with 7–10 roughly square blotches that extend onto bases of dorsal-fin elements (another dark blotch on nape in line with this row of markings); second row with 6–7 circular blotches situated just above lateral midline; lower row, if present, with 1–4 diffuse, round to oblong blotches. A few to many white, mostly round spots on at least portions of cheek, opercle, and gular region and sometimes lower jaw; this pattern resulting from the absence of melanophores against a darker background and typically significantly more prominent in males. Males also differing from females in having dark blotch of pigment on anterior portion of spinous dorsal fin. Distinctive, dark-orange markings usually present on proximal portion of dorsal fin where dark blotches in dorsalmost row of markings on body extend onto dorsal fin; where those dark blotches extend onto two (vs. one) dorsal-fin element, dark orange markings distinctly paired. Orange pigment also present on distal portions of pectoral-fin rays and lighter orange pigment present on at least distal portions of second dorsal-, caudal-, and posterior anal-fin rays; sometimes orange blotches present intermittently along lengths of second dorsal-, caudal-, and anal-fin rays forming wavy stripes or bars of pigment on those fins. Orange pigment present on top of head, in bright ring around eye, and on nasal cirrus. Some specimens with dark orange pigment on snout, in blotches radiating from pupil, on operculum, and on dorsal portions of pectoral-fin base. In one specimen most chromatophores on head and body yellow to yellowish orange, but those on nasal cirrus, around eye, and on fins distinctly orange.
Diagnostic dark markings on trunk present as described above; diagnostic white, round spots on head described above present as distinctive pale markings in preserved specimens—head markings especially prominent in large males; trunk largely tan and peppered with dark dots, especially along posterior margins of scales; lips with mottled or barred pigment pattern; a fairly uniform covering of melanophores on snout, branchiostegals, pectoral-fin base, and belly; eye sometimes surrounded by dark ring of pigment; top of head and nape usually darker than rest of head, pigment on nape usually in form of dark saddle extending over dorsal midline; two concentrations of melanophores usually visible on brain; dorsal and anal fins dusky, dark body blotches in upper row usually extending onto base of dorsal fin; dorsal fin of males with dark blotch between spines II–IV; caudal-fin rays edged with dark pigment, outer rays with more uniform scattering of melanophores; proximal portion of pectoral fin covered with scattered melanophores, distal portion with dark edging along rays; males sometimes with pigment on membranes between some pectoral rays distally; pelvic fin clear.
The species name is in honor of David W. Greenfield, in recognition of his work on blennioid fishes, particularly his work on the Starksia ocellata complex.

Known from Belize, “Colombia,” Honduras, and Panama (see “Remarks” below).
A tissue sample from a single specimen off Honduras (HON 050 on tree in Fig. 1) produced a COl sequence very similar to those of our Belize specimens, and one from Panama (PAN 018) is approximately 1% different. The Honduras specimen (Fig. 14A) has the diagnostic pigment on the cheek of male Starksia langi, and the Panama specimen (Fig. 14B) has the diagnostic small dark dots of female Starksia langi. We recognize the Honduras and Panama specimens as Starksia langi.

We lack tissue samples of Colombian specimens, but the five specimens in UF 223370 from Cayos del Este (San Andrés) and a 16-mm SL specimen from Isla Providencia (Fig. 14C) appear to have the vertically elongate pigment blotches on the trunk diagnostic of Starksia langi. Pigment is somewhat faded in the UF specimens, but the 16-mm SL female in the lot has dark spots on the head as in female Starksia langi. Although we include “Colombia” in the distribution list of this species above, we note that the Colombian specimens are from the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina, a group of islands nearly 800 km from Colombia but only 220 km from Nicaragua. We have no material from continental Colombia, but Starksia sluiteri replaces Starksia langi off Venezuela.

Starksia langi is easily distinguished from Starksia greenfieldi and Starksia sluiteri based on pigmentation of the trunk, head (females), and first dorsal fin (males). The trunk pigment of Starksia langi comprises both larger and more prominent markings than that of Starksia greenfieldi and Starksia sluiteri, and only in Starksia langi are the markings in the second row vertically elongate (generally round in the other species and sometimes considerably more diffuse in Starksia greenfieldi). Starksia greenfieldi lacks dark markings on the head in both sexes, and Starksia sluiteri lacks them in females; Starksia langi males have a prominent dark blotch on the cheek, and females have numerous small, discrete, dark spots. Males of Starksia langi lack a dark blotch on the anterior portion of the dorsal fin, whereas this blotch is present in Starksia greenfieldi and Starksia sluiteri.
Starksia greenfieldi can be distinguished from Starksia langi and Starksia sluiteri by the white (or pale), mostly round spots (absence of melanophores against a darker background) on at least portions of cheek, opercle, and gular region. This pattern is present in both sexes but is often much more prominent in males. Williams and Mounts (2003) noted that Starksia sella, another species of Starksia known only from Tobago, has small pale spots on the head, but that species lacks dark blotches along the trunk, lacks a dark blotch in the anterior dorsal fin of males, and may be larger (Williams and Mounts specimens of Starksia sella are 13.7–27.7 mm SL, our specimens of Starksia greenfieldi are 11.0–23.0 mm SL).
Starksia sluiteri (Metzelaar) is most easily distinguished from Starksia langi by having the second row of trunk blotches almost perfectly round (vs. vertically elongate), in lacking conspicuous dark spots on the head (females), and in having a dark marking on the anterior portion of the dorsal fin (males). From Starksia greenfieldi, Starksia sluiteri differs in lacking pale round spots on the head. Although Starksia sluiteri and Starksia langi have very similar chromatophore patterns, Starksia sluiteri appears to have more orange pigment on the second dorsal, caudal, and anal fins.
In their descriptions of Starksia leucovitta, Starksia melasma, Starksia multilepis, Starksia rava, and Starksia sella, Williams and Mounts (2003) noted that those species belong to the Starksia sluiteri complex. Large genetic distances separate the species of the Starksia sluiteri complex, and our Starksia multilepis samples from Brazil are nearly as similar genetically to Starksia sluiteri as Starksia langi is (Fig. 1). We have no tissue samples of the other proposed members of the Starksia sluiteri complex for comparative purposes. Those species are not very similar to Starksia sluiteri in trunk pigment, particularly in lacking any bold markings. Starksia fasciata from the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI 9204, TCI 9349, TCI 9350) is embedded within our Starksia sluiteri complex (Fig. 1), and Starksia fasciata is morphologically similar to species in that complex (Fig. 15). In Williams and Mounts (2003) diagnostic key, Starksia fasciata and Starksia sluiteri are in the same couplet, separated by pattern of pigment on the trunk (bars of trunk pigment in the former, rows of dark blotches in the latter). Male and female Starksia fasciata from the Turks and Caicos Islands (Fig. 15) are very similar to male and female Starksia langi from Belize in head pigmentation and in having prominent orange markings along the base of the dorsal fin. More material is needed to determine if Starksia smithvanizi, a species that Williams and Mounts (2003) considered part of the Starksia fasciata complex, also is genetically aligned with the Starksia sluiteri complex. We reiterate that our neighbor-joining tree (Fig. 1) is not intended to reflect phylogenetic relationships, and a species-level phylogeny derived from multiple genes should help resolve species and supra-specific relationships in the Starksia sluiteri complex.
Museum specimens examined from the Lesser Antilles (Dominica) and Puerto Rico appear to be Starksia sluiteri based on trunk pigment (round vs. elongate blotches in the second row of markings) and no conspicuous round pale spots on the cheek. The pigment is somewhat faded in those specimens, however, and more material, including tissue samples for genetic analysis, is needed. Two female specimens from Navassa (USNM 361059) are not Starksia sluiteri, as the markings in the second row of trunk blotches are elongate, not round.However, those markings are rectangular in the Navassa specimens, and the markings in the upper row are square—much more so than in our material of Starksia langi from the western Caribbean. The larger of the two females has some dark spots on the head as in Starksia langi. More material is needed. Other museum material examined (e.g., the UF specimens from Antigua and Mexico) are too faded to identify to species.
Gilbert (1965) and Greenfield (1979) noted that some species of Starksia can only be distinguished on the basis of color patterns—i.e., they exhibit no other morphological differences except sometimes modal differences in counts. Greenfield (1979) surmised that color patterns on the lips and sides of the head may be important in species recognition in blennioid fishes, which often live in cryptic habitats, in some cases (e.g., some chaenopsids) with only the heads typically visible. Our morphological investigation of the multiple genetic lineages within Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri resulted in similar findings—i.e., most of the member species within the three complexes are distinguished from one another solely on the basis of pigment patterns, sometimes only differences in pigment on the lips and cheeks. All differences in counts are modal.
Morphological differences other than pigmentation separate some of the species complexes; for example, members of the Starksia atlantica complex lack an orbital cirrus, and those of Starksia lepicoelia have a scaled belly. Genetic divergence among species within each complex is generally smaller than that between complexes: 2–14% within Starksia atlantica, 1–9% within Starksia lepicoelia, and 7–19% within Starksia sluiteri vs. 17–22% between Starksia atlantica and Starksia lepicoelia, 17–24% between Starksia lepicoelia and Starksia sluiteri, and 17–23% between Starksia atlantica and Starksia sluiteri (Tables 4–7). The genetic distances separating species of the Starksia lepicoelia complex are particularly small, and those species are separated on the basis of minor differences in pigmentation on the head. Larger genetic distances separate most species of the Starksia sluiteri complex, and more prominent differences in trunk pigmentation separate some of those species. There is thus a correlation between small differences in COl sequences and minor differences in pigmentation, suggesting that pigment patterns may be among the first morphological changes accompanying speciation in Starksia. Greenfield (1979) did not have the benefit of genetic data for comparative purposes, but our COl data for four species in his Starksia ocellata complex (Fig. 1, Appendix 2) support his decision to recognize species almost entirely on the basis of minor differences in pigment. Although species recognition based on such limited morphological data may in general be a questionable practice, the congruence between Greenfield’s (1979) Starksia ocellata species and the COl data supports this practice in Starksia.

There is not, however, universal congruence between genetic divergence and recognizable morphological differences in our data set. One Starksia greenfieldi specimen, TOB 9312, is 2% different from other Starksia greenfieldi, and one Starksia fasciata, TCI 9204, is 2% different from other Starksia fasciata. Both of those values are high for intraspecific variation in fishes in general (often well less than 1%), but we find no morphological evidence supporting the genetic divergences. Similarly Starksia sangreyae comprises two sublineages that are as genetically distinct in COl (2–3%) as Starksia sangreyae is from Starksia atlantica (2–3%), yet no consistent morphological differences were discovered, not even minor differences in color pattern. Even more puzzling, the two genetic sublineages of Starksia lepicoelia are4–6% different in COl, yet we found no morphological differences between them (Fig. 6). Very little material of one of those lineages is available, and further investigation is needed. Specimens in the two lineages were taken in the Bahamas at the same station, in 20–40 ft. of water off Great Stirrup Cay.
In contrast to the examples above, very little sequence divergence in COl exists between Starksia sangreyae from Belizeand Starksia atlantica from Bahamas/Turks and Caicos(2–3%), yet those species are easily distinguished on the basis of trunk pigment. Similar incongruences between COl data and morphology have been documented. For example, Baldwin et al. (2009b) found two morphological (pigment) variants of the goby Coryphopterus venezuelae, yet those morphs are not genetically distinct. Victor (2010) pointed out incongruences between COl data and morphologically recognizable species in greenbanded gobies (Elacatinus spp.). Specifically, he noted that Elacatinus multifasciatus from the eastern Caribbean and Elacatinus panamensis from Panama are morphologically extremely similar, but exhibit 11.3% sequence divergence in COl; he further noted that despite prominent differences in color pattern between Elacatinus rubrigenus and Elacatinus panamensis, those species exhibit only 3.3% sequence divergence in COl.
Those examples notwithstanding, the general congruence between COl lineages and morphologically recognizable species in western Atlantic Starksia is remarkable, and we have found the same to be true in our genetic and morphological investigations of other shorefish genera (e.g., Baldwin et al. 2009a, Baldwin et al. 2009b, Tornabene et al. 2010). A paper summarizing Smithsonian investigations of western Central Atlantic shorefish diversity and the utility of DNA Barcoding in this work is in preparation. Cases in which incongruences exist between genetic and morphological data ultimately will be further investigated; because DNA barcoding involves sequencing a relatively short segment of a single mitochondrial gene, adding additional genetic data may help resolve some conflicts. On the morphological side, adding information from early life history stages may be of value: the pelagic larval stages of many marine fishes offer a suite of characters for study not present in adults.
A striking element of our COl data for Starksia (Fig. 1) is the correlation between genetic lineages and geography within the Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, Starksia sluiteri, and Starksia ocellata species complexes Specimens from Bahamas, Belize, Curacao, Saba Bank, and Tobago never occur in more than one genetic lineage within each complex, yet the species complexes themselves are broadly distributed (Fig. 16). Starksia nanodes also appears to be a broadly distributed species complex, with geographically distinct genetic lineages in Panama, Barbados, Saba Bank, and Belize (Fig. 1). Greenfield (1979) proposed superspecies status (sensu Amadon 1966, Mayr 1963) for the Starksia ocellata complex based on its six allopatric component species, and the Starksia atlantica, Starksia lepicoelia, and Starksia sluiteri species complexes described herein could be categorized likewise (we note, however, that the superspecies category has not been widely adopted in systematic treatments of fishes). It is not clear what evolutionary mechanisms are driving speciation within Starksia, but the life history of the group is characterized by a short pelagic phase of about two weeks (Victor, unpublished data). Although pelagic larval duration (PLD) is not always a good indicator of genetic structure (e.g., Bowen et al. 2006), a short PLD combined with restricted movement of adults may support the evolution of numerous allopatric species within a group by restricting gene flow among populations. It is premature to conduct a phylogeographic analysis of western Atlantic Starksia, but we concur with Greenfield (1979) that the division of some Starksia species into multiple allopatric component species is not typical of western Atlantic shorefishes in general. As noted by Floeter et al. (2008), Briggs’ (1974) two major biogeographic provinces of the Caribbean (western Caribbean plus Florida and West Indian/eastern Caribbean) are largely supported by recent genetic and biogeographical studies. Starksia is not the only exception to this general trend. Colin (2010) described five eco-morphological suites of western Atlantic Elacatinus goby species that are similar to our Starksia species complexes in that each comprises multiple species usually with allopatric distributions, and the suites themselves are broadly distributed. Considerably more studies of diversity and distribution of speciose genera of small, cryptic, Caribbean reef fishes and other Caribbean marine life are needed to determine if there are subdivisions of the major biogeographic provinces and, if so, what evolutionary mechanisms may be supporting them. Rocha et al. (2005) suggested that ecological speciation, in which natural selection in different environmental conditions in adjacent locations may drive populations along separate evolutionary pathways, could help explain high levels of species diversity in marine fishes in the absence of sufficient physical barriers to account for that diversity. Colin (2010) suggested that faunal breaks in Elacatinus species may correlate well with observed ocean currents, and he proposed to further investigate known fish distributions and actual dispersal potential as estimated from satellite-tracked current drifters.

For Starksia, future investigation must include more taxonomic and geographic coverage. Increased sampling will assuredly result in the recognition of new species and likely of new species complexes. The faunal breaks that separate members of the species complexes are unknown. In Starksia atlantica and Starksia lepicoelia, our specimens from Bahamas and Turks and Caicos represent the same species, and in Starksia sluiteri, specimens from Belize, Honduras, and Panama appear to be the same. Specimens in close proximity geographically thus tend to cluster into recognizable species. As better coverage is attained, it will be interesting to see if the same geographical boundaries characterize more than one of the species complexes or if the boundaries are different for each. Likewise it will be interesting to compare geographic boundaries of Starksia species with faunal breaks in other reef fishes such as Elacatinus. Future phylogenetic studies in which relationships among species and species complexes of Starksia and other groups are hypothesized should help shed light on patterns of speciation in small reef fishes of the western Atlantic.
Because we do not know how much more investigation is required to obtain a reasonably complete picture of Starksia biodiversity and biogeography, the words of Winston Churchill included as an epigraph in this paper seem particularly appropriate. The study of Starksia must continue.
