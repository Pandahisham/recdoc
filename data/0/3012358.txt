THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE IN PATIENTS WITH MANIC DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS

16 cases of affective disorder were studied. 8 patients received carbamazepine and 8 received either chlorpromazine or imipramine. Ratings were carried out on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Bech Rafaelsen Mania Rating scale and a side-effects symptom check list. Garbamazepine was found to be an effective treatment for affective disorders, possessing both anti-manic as well as anti-depressant properties.
