Structural, neurochemical, and functional abnormalities have been identified in                    the brains of individuals with bipolar disorder, including in key brain                    structures implicated in postural control, i.e. the cerebellum, brainstem, and                    basal ganglia. Given these findings, we tested the hypothesis that postural                    control deficits are present in individuals with bipolar disorder. Sixteen                    participants with bipolar disorder (BD) and 16 age-matched non-psychiatric                    healthy controls were asked to stand as still as possible on a force platform                    for 2 minutes under 4 conditions: (1) eyes open-open base; (2) eyes closed-open                    base; (3) eyes open-closed base; and (4) eyes closed-closed base. Postural sway                    data were submitted to conventional quantitative analyses of the magnitude of                    sway area using the center of pressure measurement. In addition, data were                    submitted to detrended fluctuation analysis, a nonlinear dynamical systems                    analytic technique that measures complexity of a time-series, on both the                    anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions. The bipolar disorder group had                    increased sway area, indicative of reduced postural control. Decreased                    complexity in the medio-lateral direction was also observed for the bipolar                    disorder group, suggesting both a reduction in dynamic range available to them                    for postural control, and that their postural corrections were primarily                    dominated by longer time-scales. On both of these measures, significant                    interactions between diagnostic group and visual condition were also observed,                    suggesting that the BD participants were impaired in their ability to make                    corrections to their sway pattern when no visual information was available.                    Greater sway magnitude and reduced complexity suggest that individuals with                    bipolar disorder have deficits in sensorimotor integration and a reduced range                    of timescales available on which to make postural corrections.

Although the nature and origins of bipolar disorder (BD) are still relatively poorly                understood, abnormalities in diverse brain regions have been identified. Behavioral,                structural, and diffusion tensor imaging studies provide convergent evidence of                anterior limbic network abnormalities in BD, and the pattern of emotional and                cognitive deficits observed in BD is consistent with abnormalities in a                cerebello-striatal-prefrontal circuit [1], [2].
An emerging literature suggests motor abnormalities accompany mood and psychotic                symptoms of BD, although the relationship between motor and mood disorders has                rarely been studied explicitly [3]. Some motor symptoms appear to be state-related, i.e.,                linked to either manic, depressed, or mixed mood states, while other symptoms, such                as tardive dyskinesia and myoclonus emerge from the use of neuroleptic medications                    [4].                Accumulating evidence indicates that subtle motor anomalies may exist independent of                acute mood state in BD and motor dysfunction could, therefore, be a core feature of                the disorder. Such neurological soft signs have been observed to be significantly                increased in euthymic BD patients in comparison to controls [5], [6], [7].
Importantly, the brain areas that participate in mood regulation and have been found                to be abnormal in BD also play critical roles in motor function. For example, the                cerebellum is a key structure in motor control and plays an integral role in the                production of smooth, coordinated movement and in maintaining postural control                through appropriately timed activation of agonist and antagonist muscles. More                recently, empirical and theoretical evidence have indicated that the cerebellum                plays a significant role in psychological functions as well, including modulation of                perceptual, cognitive, and affective functions [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], which is believed to occur                via its modulation of the anterior limbic network [1], [13], [14], [15]. Structural imaging studies                indicate cerebellar abnormalities, in particular, cerebellar atrophy in BD [13], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Neurochemical                alterations have also been reported [23], [24], [25], [26]. Moreover, behavioral evidence also points to                disturbances in cerebellar function in people with BD, who exhibit deficits in                eyeblink conditioning, a sensitive assay of cerebellar function [27].
The basal ganglia also play a crucial role in motor behavior and show abnormalities                in BD. This brain circuit is crucial for the initiation of movement and plays an                important role in multisensory integration, especially proprioceptive-motor                integration [28].                This latter function is particularly critical for postural control. Neuroimaging                evidence suggests alterations in the basal ganglia of individuals with BD [29], [30], [31]. Behavioral                evidence also supports basal ganglia dysfunction in BD. For example, BD patients                were significantly impaired in a study of two electromechanical measures of motor                function, force steadiness, and velocity scaling, which are sensitive to basal                ganglia abnormalties [3].
Finally, the brainstem is also critically involved in motor function, and is                particularly involved in the coordination of vestibular and visual input with                afferent proprioceptive information [32]. Several small studies have                reported abnormalities in the brainstem nuclei of BD patients, particularly in the                locus coeruleus [33], [34].
Postural sway is a sensitive test of the integrity of motor control that is likely to                be affected by abnormal or aberrant functioning of the cerebellum, basal ganglia,                and brainstem. Given evidence of abnormalities in the aforementioned brain circuits                in bipolar disorder, the present study tested the hypothesis that BD patients                exhibit increased postural sway, indicative of poorer postural regulation, relative                to a healthy control group. The second goal of this research was to test the                hypothesis that the dynamic properties of movement as it evolves over time are also                abnormal in BD. To examine the processes generating the sway pattern, dynamic                analyses were applied [35]. Complexity theory in health [36] predicts that disease states                manifest themselves through a loss of complexity, that is, a shift from irregularity                to greater regularity. This shift would be manifested in a sway pattern that evolves                primarily on slower time-scales due to the loss of high frequency components in the                system, which allow for faster and smaller-scale postural adjustments. Indeed, this                increase in regularity of movement has been observed in several clinical populations                    [37]. In                contrast, the sway patterns of healthy people would be predicted to possess a                broader range of time-scales, which allows for greater behavioral adaptability. Loss                of complexity is hypothesized to be a reflection of a decline in the number of                components or connections between these components, for example, the availability                and integration of different sources of sensory information [38], [39]. In the current context,                such a change in sway pattern could be indicative of a deficit in in multisensory                integration mediated by cerebellar, basal ganglia, and brainstem circuits.
In order to examine the amount and dynamic pattern of postural sway in participants                with BD, four different postural conditions that alter the availability of                proprioceptive (closed vs. open base stance) and visual (eyes open vs. eyes closed)                information were employed. Proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual inputs affect                different time-scales contributing to the correction of postural stability and                removal of any one of these components cause increases in sway area [40]. For example,                visual cues stabilize posture on longer time-scales [41], [42], whereas proprioceptive cues                are responsible for short timescale corrections [43]. Therefore, if deficits in                postural control exist in BD, manipulations of sensory input may be revealing with                respect to specific domains in which sensory integration is affected. It was                hypothesized that sway area would be significantly larger in BD in comparison to a                non-psychiatric healthy control group. Moreover, it was expected that BD                participants would be more affected by a change in stance and the loss of visual                input, manifested as increased sway area, reflecting decreased integration of                sensorimotor information.
Finally, although sway area generally can be expected to increase with the removal of                sensorimotor input, the alterations in the complexity of sway dynamics caused by                manipulations of either proprioceptive or visual input in non-clinical populations                are not identical. For example, the proprioceptive feedback loop works along much                short time-scales [10], whereas the visual system contributes to low frequency,                longer time-scale postural control [41], [42]. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [44] was employed to                quantify the architecture of spatiotemporal patterns resident in postural sway as                they unfold over time, and to examine how manipulations of visual and proprioceptive                input altered this architecture. Essentially, DFA quantifies the relationship                between variability and the timescale on which it is measured. The primary DFA                output is the α-value, where higher values generally indicate decreased                complexity and lower values reflect increased complexity. Reduction of                proprioceptive input could be expected to reduce the overall complexity of postural                regulation and increase DFA α-values due to reduced high frequency, short                time-scale components in the postural sway pattern. In contrast, removal of visual                input should increase the complexity of postural corrections, resulting in lower DFA                α-values. Therefore, the examination of the dynamical properties of postural                sway using DFA may provide information regarding whether specific aspects of                sensorimotor integration are affected in bipolar disorder. We predict that,                consistent with the loss of complexity hypothesis, DFA of postural sway in BD                patients will reveal decreased complexity overall and therefore be less affected by                alterations in the amount of sensorimotor information available, indicating that                postural control is predominated by long time-scale components and reflecting less                behavioral flexibility in the motor control domain.
The study procedures were approved by the Indiana University-Purdue University                    Indianapolis Institutional Review Board and the study was conducted in                    accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh amendments). Written                    informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Participants included in the analyses were 16 individuals (7 women) with DSM-IV                    bipolar disorder (BD) and 16 age-matched non-psychiatric healthy controls (9                    women). A boxplot method of outlier identification (SPSS statistical package)                    was used to classify extreme data values separately for each analysis. Extreme                    outliers were defined as data values>6 quartiles from the upper or lower ends                    of the inter-quartile range. Following age-matching, there were initially 18                    participants in each group, but one BP and one control were removed from the                    analysis due to classification as extreme outliers in at least one COP                    condition. All demographic and statistical information is reported for the                    remaining 16 participants in each group. Gender did not differ between groups                        (X2(1) = 0.50, p = ns).                    Diagnostic status was determined using the Structured Clinical Interview for                    DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) [45] sections for mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and                    substance abuse disorders, and chart review. BD patients were enrolled in a                    longitudinal study in which their mood was assessed using the SCID-I as well as                    clinical symptom ratings. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [46] was used to                    assess symptoms of mania and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scales                    (MADRS) [47] was used to evaluate depressive symptoms. All BD                    participants were in a euthymic state when they participated in the postural                    sway experiment. Healthy controls were recruited through newspaper                    advertisements and fliers, and did not meet DSM-IV criteria for any Axis I or                    Axis II disorder. Any participant who met criteria for substance dependency                    within three months prior to testing was excluded from the study. Diagnostic                    interviews and clinical ratings were performed by trained research personnel.                    Kappa inter-rater reliability in this laboratory setting has been 0.95 for mood                    disorders vs. schizophrenia, or other diagnoses.
The mean age of BD participants (38.6 yrs, SD = 10.5) did                    not differ from controls (38.4 yrs, SD = 10.5),                    t(30) = −0.07, p = ns. Body mass                    index (BMI) of BD participants (M = 27.9,                    SD = 5.2) and controls (M = 27.6,                    SD = 5.8) also did not statistically differ,                    t(30) = −0.16, p = ns. Inclusion                    criteria were completion of grade school level education, normal or corrected to                    normal hearing and vision, no history of cardiovascular or neurological disease,                    body mass index of less than 40, and no history of head injury that resulted in                    loss of consciousness. All BD participants were euthymic, with mean YMRS scores                    of 4.6 (SD = 5.1) and MADRS scores of 4.2                    (SD = 4.7). Finally, BD participants had been assessed                    within the previous 2 weeks using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)                        [48]. No                    participants had positive AIMS scores.
Four individuals with bipolar disorder were un-medicated at the time of testing.                    The remaining 12 were on various combinations of psychotropic medications, which                    are listed for each individual in Table 1.
Each participant was required to stand as still as possible while barefoot on an                    AMTI Accusway (Watertown, MA) force platform under the following task                    conditions: (1) eyes open-open base; (2) eyes closed-open base; (3) eyes                    open-closed base; and (4) eyes closed-closed base. During the open base                    conditions, feet were placed shoulder width apart; participants stood with their                    feet together (approximately 1 inch apart) during the closed base conditions.                    Each trial lasted 2 minutes.
The center of pressure (COP) motion along the anterior-posterior and                    medio-lateral axes of motion were obtained from the force platform, sampled at a                    rate of 50 Hz and filtered with a 9th order Butterworth low-pass filter with a                    25 Hz cutoff frequency to isolate the low-frequency postural sway process. Sway                    area was measured during each trial to provide the amount of sway for each                    participant during each condition. Postural sway signals have time-varying                    statistical properties [49], which is reflected in the fact that taking the                    average at different time points during the task results in a “wandering                    mean”. These variations in mean and standard deviation over time are known                    as nonstationarity. To minimize the effects of nonstationarity in the postural                    sway time series, a 95% confidence ellipse was obtained around the COP                    motion along both the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral axes using the method                    presented in Oliveira et al. [50], as this method is much more robust to the effects of                    outliers. Exemplar data from a BD and a control participant are depicted                    graphically in Figure 1 with                    corresponding confidence ellipses for the eyes open and eyes closed conditions                    in the open stance condition.
Sway path is in red, with sway area represented in blue. Eyes open-open                            base sway areas are shown for the control (A) and bipolar disorder (B)                            participant. Corresponding data for the eyes closed-open base condition                            are shown in the lower panels for the same control (C) and bipolar                            disorder (D) participants.
In order to assess the more complex dynamics of postural sway, detrended                    fluctuation analysis (DFA) was performed on the COP data. DFA was specifically                    designed to be robust against nonstationarity within a time-series [44] and therefore                    represents a superior approach to traditional descriptors of variability such as                    the standard deviation. The DFA analysis indexes the relative distribution of                    variance within the data across a range of different time-scales. This produces                    a profile of the time series in terms of the rate of growth in fluctuation of                    variance as a function of increasing time-scale. The rate of growth in                    fluctuation magnitude across time-scales is indexed by the slope of this                    function (plotted on a log-log scale), known as the α-value, which is an                    index of long-range autocorrelations in time-series. The plotted DFA for a                    single subject is shown in Figure                        2. An α-value of 1 is present in 1/f noise and                    characterizes fractals and healthy physiological systems, indicating the maximum                    degree of self-similarity in a signal [51]. This is a unique pattern of                    complexity, as the magnitude of the fluctuations grows in direct proportion to                    the time-scale on which the fluctuations are measured. A time series                    characterized by fluctuations across fewer time scales would yield a steeper                    slope, i.e. a larger α-value, indicating a less complex system. A flatter                    slope, i.e., lower α-value indicates that fluctuations are spread more                    evenly across a range of time scales in the time series, reflective of greater                    complexity. It is important to note, however, that values of DFA of 0.5 indicate                    a completely random, or white noise process, while values <0.5 represent an                    anti-persistent time-series, where the behavior of the system at future time                    points is antagonistic to that of its past and present. DFA was calculated for                    both side-to-side, or medio-lateral (ML), and front-to-back, or                    anterior-posterior (AP), directions. Due to a main effect of direction (ML                    versus AP) and an interaction between direction and diagnostic group                    (F(1,34) = 6.44, p<.05) in the detrended fluctuation                    analysis (F(1,34) = 32.35, p<0.001), separate                    statistical analyses were conducted for the α-values calculated for                    medio-lateral sway (DFA-ML) and antero-posterior (DFA-AP) sway.
Data for the control and bipolar disorder participant can be found in                            Panel A and B, respectively. Each individual symbol in each panel plots                            the fluctuation magnitude against the particular timescale on which it                            is measured. The slope of the fitted line for each condition produces                            the α-value, which is the primary dependent variable for DFA.
The three dependent variables (sway area, DFA-ML, and DFA-AP) were evaluated                    using a 2 (Vision: eyes open vs. eyes closed)×2 (Base: open base vs.                    closed base)×2 (Group: BD vs. control) Repeated Measures ANOVA. Time,                    Vision, and Base were within-subjects factors while Group served as the                    between-subjects factor. To evaluate possible medication effects on postural                    sway performance, participants with bipolar disorder were collapsed into a                    single group with medication status as the independent variable. Participants                    were divided into three groups: those on antipsychotic medication (typical or                    atypical) were assigned to the “antipsychotic” group                    (n = 9), those who were on other psychotropic drugs but                    were not taking antipsychotic medication were assigned to the “other                    psychotropic” category (n = 3), and those who were                    not currently taking medication were included in the “unmedicated”                    group (n = 4). Repeated measures ANOVAs were then conducted                    for all primary dependent variables. In addition, bipolar disorder participants                    were coded as “on” or “off” for the following medication                    categories: atypical antipsychotic drug use (ON = 9), SSRIs                    (ON = 4) and a test of medicated (any psychotropic                    medication including antipsychotics) versus unmedicated participants                    (ON = 12). Separate ANOVAs were conducted for each category                    and for each dependent variable. Finally, chlorpromazine equivalent dosages were                    calculated using the method described by Woods [51].
Results of the major dependent variables are reported with their corresponding                    effect sizes in the form of partial eta2 (ηP2). An                    estimate of effect size was provided by Cohen [52]: small effect sizes are less                    than 0.06; moderate effect sizes range from 0.06 to 0.14; large effect sizes are                    greater than .14. The α-level was set at p<0.05. Post-hoc univariate                    tests were conducted for significant (p<0.05) interactions.
Exemplar plots of COP data from a BD and control participant in the eyes-open and                eyes-closed conditions in an open stance are shown in Figure 1, with corresponding plots of their DFA                graphically depicted in Figure                2. These particular participants were chosen because their COP data were                closest to the means within their groups. Group means and standard deviations for                each dependent variable can be found in Table 2.
EOOB: eyes open-open base; EOCB: eyes open-closed base; ECOB: eyes                            closed-open base; ECCB: eyes closed-closed base.

No significant differences for medication status were found for any primary                    dependent variables, nor were there significant correlations between                    chlorpromazine equivalent dosages and any postural sway variables.
Although no participants with current alcohol dependence were included in the                    study, 5 participants with bipolar disorder had previously met criteria for                    DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence. When these participants were excluded and all                    analyses were run including only the remaining 11 who had no history of alcohol                    dependence, all results involving interactions with and main effects of                    diagnosis reported below were essentially unaltered. All significant results                    using the entire sample continued to reach significance (p<0.05).
The bipolar disorder group had significantly larger sway areas than controls,                    resulting in a main effect of diagnosis, (F(1,30) = 9.08,                    p<0.01 (ηP2 = 0.23). There was also an                    interaction between visual condition and diagnostic group,                    F(1,30) = 5.64, p<0.05                    (ηP2 = 0.16), due to the BD group showing                    increased sway compared to the control group in the eyes closed condition. Figure 3A graphically depicts                    the changes in both groups as a function of visual input. A marginally                    significant base x diagnosis interaction was observed,                    F(1,30) = 4.10, p = 0.05                        (ηP2 = 0.12), due to the BD group                    showing an increase in sway area in the closed base condition compared to                    controls. A significant within-subjects visual condition x stance interaction                    was also apparent (F(1,30) = 7.08, p<0.05                        (ηP2 = 0.19), in which the eyes closed                    condition had a larger effect on the closed base condition relative to the open                    stance condition. There were also within-subjects main effects of visual                    condition, F(1,30) = 13.50, p = 0.001,                        ηP2 = 0.31, and stance,                    F(1,30) = 17.60, p<0.001,                    ηP2 = 0.37, where sway areas were smaller                    during the eyes open and open stance conditions.
Each participant's data is represented by a single data point in the                            eyes-open and eyes-closed condition in each panel. COP increased more                            dramatically for bipolar disorder participants (diamonds) than for                            controls (circles). DFA-ML decreased for controls, but was relatively                            unaffected in bipolar disorder, suggesting that the patient group was                            less able to compensate for the loss of visual information by using                            vestibular or proprioceptive information.
The DFA analysis yielded a significant main effect of diagnosis                    (F(1,30) = 5.71, p<0.05,                    ηP = 0.16), due to higher α-values                    overall in the BD group. In addition, there was a vision x diagnostic group                    interaction (F(1,30) = 5.54, p<0.05,                    ηP = 0.16). A post-hoc analysis of the                    vision x diagnosis interaction revealed a significant difference between                    diagnostic groups during the eyes-closed conditions (p<0.05) where controls                    had lower α-values than the BD participants. DFA results for both groups in                    the eyes open and eyes closed conditions can be seen in Figure 3B. This difference was not observed                    when the participants' eyes were open. A significant within-subjects effect                    of stance was observed, F(1,30) = 22.78, p<0.001,                        ηP = 0.43, where α-values were                    lower during the open-base conditions in comparison to the closed-base                    conditions.
There were no significant interactions or main effects for diagnostic group                    (p>0.05). A significant within-subjects vision x stance interaction was                    observed, (F(1,30) = 34.88 p<0.001,                        ηP2 = .54) as well as a                    significant effect of vision (F(1,30) = 19.23, p<0.001,                        ηP2 = .39). Post-hoc                    analysis of the vision x stance interaction revealed that α-values were                    significantly lower (p<0.05) in the eyes open condition when the base was                    open compared to closed; however, α-values were significantly higher                    (p<0.01) in the eyes closed condition when the base was open compared to when                    it was closed. The vision effect showed that α-values were higher when the                    participants' eyes were open.
The primary findings of the present study were that participants with bipolar                disorder manifested increased postural sway in comparison to non-psychiatric                controls and were particularly affected by the loss of visual information. Our                finding of greater sway across the various stances and vision conditions suggests                poorer postural control in bipolar disorder and is consistent with previous findings                of motor dysfunction in BD [3], [5], [6], [7].
A key finding was that the loss of visual information in the eyes closed condition                resulted in increased sway area in the bipolar disorder group, an effect not                observed in controls. This suggests that the BD participants have reduced postural                control when visual information is absent. Interestingly, the narrowing of the                stance, which reduces the availability of proprioceptive information, did not                compound the effects of reduced visual information in BD participants. Our results                also show that increasing the difficulty of the postural task does not necessarily                magnify differences between controls and participants in the bipolar disorder group                insofar as there were no significant post-hoc group differences (p>0.05) in the                most challenging stance and vision conditions (i.e., the eyes-closed and closed-base                position).
When dynamical systems analyses were applied to examination of postural sway, group                differences became apparent in the medio-lateral but not the anterior-posterior                direction. This finding of less complex dynamics in the BD group compared to                controls is consistent with the loss of complexity hypothesis in disease and                disorder [38],                perhaps indicating weakened links between the sensorimotor systems, i.e., impaired                integration of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems, that form the                critical feedback loops essential to the control of postural sway. Both groups                demonstrated the expected pattern of results in response to manipulations of                proprioceptive input. Specifically, DFA α-values increased when proprioceptive                input was reduced (i.e., in the closed-base condition). Knowing that proprioceptive                inputs contribute to short time-scale postural adjustments [43], this decrease in complexity,                indicated by the increase in DFA α-values, most likely represents increased                predominance of slow time-scale changes in posture that occur when proprioceptive                information is reduced.
While the bipolar disorder and control groups had similar responses to manipulations                of proprioceptive input (through changes in stance) overall, differences in sway                dynamics between groups were particularly apparent when visual input was removed.                Specifically, DFA α-values decreased for controls in the eyes-closed condition,                but remained relatively unchanged in the bipolar disorder group. The DFA values for                the BD participants remained high, indicating that their sway dynamics were                dominated by slow time-scales of change. The pattern of results observed in the                control group, in contrast, indicated that sway dynamics became more complex when                visual input was removed, consistent with previous studies indicating that visual                information contributes to low frequency, longer time-scale postural adjustments                    [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,                removal of visual input would increase the relative contribution of short                time-scales, resulting in more complex sway dynamics (i.e., reduced DFA                α-values). This allows the short time-scale proprioceptive inputs to compensate                for the absence of visual information by becoming the predominant means of                generating postural corrections [43].
The fact that the bipolar disorder group maintained high DFA α-values (indicative                of reduced complexity) even when visual input was removed suggests that the BD                participants were less able to make corrections to their sway pattern when no visual                information was available. Reduced short time-scale corrections contributes to                decreased complexity in postural sway in BD, a finding that is consistent with the                postulation that aging and disease are associated with a loss of complexity due to                the loss of short time-scale components in physiologic systems [38]. One possible explanation for                this result is that individuals with BD have a compressed range of time-scales                available with which to make postural corrections, preventing them from making the                shorter time-scale corrections that the controls were able to implement. Another                possible explanation is that the BD participants have a reduced ability to integrate                and utilize proprioceptive information for motor control. Interestingly, BD                participants appear to be able to increase the contribution of slow time-scale                postural corrections similar to controls, as they exhibited an increase in DFA                α-values from the open-base to the closed-base. Overall, these findings converge                to suggest that BD participants are restricted in their ability to adapt to task                demands only if the task requires greater fast timescale postural corrections.
A consistent finding across the sway area and DFA analyses was that a large decline                in postural control occurred in the eyes-closed condition in BD irrespective of                stance. In particular, increased sway area and decreased ability to implement                postural adjustments in the medio-lateral direction in the BD group were apparent                compared to controls when visual input was removed. The convergence of our results                across both magnitude and dynamic analysis is important, especially because dynamic                analyses (such as DFA) are often considered a more sensitive assay of postural sway                and are able to reflect different properties of postural control that sway area                alone cannot [37], [53]. Furthermore, DFA α-values were less variable between                subjects than the sway area (see Figure                    3), which increases confidence in results obtained using both                approaches.
It may be of significance that diagnostic group differences in postural dynamics were                found only in the medio-lateral direction. In general, postural sway in the                anterior-posterior direction is primarily generated at the ankle, while postural                control in the medio-lateral direction is the product of hip movements [54], owed                primarily to the anatomical properties of these joints. One interpretation of the                present results is that they could be indicative of abnormal motor development in                BD, given that motor development of the postural system often follows a                distal-to-proximal direction (foot-to-hip). Developmental insults can alter the                sequence of motor development [55]. Subtle developmental alterations are one possible                explanation for the current results; in this context the BD participants may not                have fully developed the control of posture using their hips. While speculative,                this postulation is consistent with studies supporting a role of neurodevelopmental                factors contributing to bipolar disorder [56], [57], [58], [59], [60] (but see [61]).
The results of this current study are consistent with previous observations of                comorbidities between motor dysfunction and mood disorders. For example, in                Parkinson's Disease, depression is a common feature of the illness [62], [63] and appears                to increase in severity as PD progresses [64]. These findings suggest that                mood dysregulation may be a core feature of the disease process in Parkinson's                    [3]. In                Huntington's Disease, both depression [65] and mania [66] are commonly                reported. Moreover, pathophysiological alterations in the circuitry implicated in                depression have also been observed in Huntington's Disease, i.e., decreased                glucose metabolism in orbitofrontal cortex and posterior parietal regions [67]. In addition,                although the basal ganglia circuitry is primarily affected, there is also evidence                of cerebellar abnormalities in both Parkinson's [68], [69] and Huntington's [70], [71], [72]. These                comorbidities between motor and mood disorders suggest dysfunctions in similar                neural circuits may underlie both types of pathology, although further research is                needed to gain a greater understanding of the differences in symptom presentation                across these disorders.
One complication in fully understanding the current results is the relative                heterogeneity in the BD participants, as evidenced by the large between-subjects                standard deviations in sway area. The heterogeneity in the BD group could have                arisen as a result of differences in medication regimens. Medication confounds are                difficult to completely eliminate or adequately control for statistically. Gaining                access to medication naïve patients is also not a completely satisfactory                answer because such patients are often symptomatic, introducing a confound of acute                mood state. Therefore, testing medicated, euthymic patients represents one approach                to investigating the underlying mechanisms of bipolar disorder. Testing                never-medicated first-episode (often symptomatic) patients is a complementary                strategy. Each approach presents a different type confound (medication vs. clinical                mood state status), but nevertheless provides a part of the overall picture of the                pathophysiology of BD.
The approach we have chosen for this study, i.e., studying euthymic, medicated                patients, clearly presents difficulties in the interpretation of the present results                because it is difficult to determine what proportion of the effect size arises from                underlying mechanisms associated with bipolar disorder and what effects were due to                medications. Although the small sample size makes disentangling medication effects                difficult, an additional, possibly insurmountable obstacle is the number of                different psychotropic medications each participant was on, often with different                pharmacological mechanisms, and their interacting and sometimes opposing effects on                postural control. For example, neuroleptics have been shown to negatively affect                sway dynamics [73]                while SSRIs have been shown to reduce the amount of sway in animal models [74], an effect                that would be viewed as enhanced postural control.
In addition, postural sway may have been altered in patients taking lithium. There is                evidence that lithium improves motor coordination and balance on the rotarod test in                a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease [75]. Lithium is also believed to have                neuroprotective effects in bipolar disorder [76] and such effects have been                observed in animal models [77], [78]. Notably, lithium prevented apoptosis in the striatum in                a rat model of HD [79] and cerebellar granule cell death [80], suggesting a mechanism by which                it could improve motor function over the long-term. In the context of the present                study, 4 of 16 BD patients were on lithium, which could have had a normalizing                effect on the postural sway performance of these patients. However, we still                observed significant between groups differences in spite of lithium treatment in                25% of our sample. Additional information about the existence of postural                control deficits could be obtained by studying postural sway in a                medication-naïve, or at least a currently unmedicated sample of bipolar                disorder individuals. This would be a necessary step in order to obtain a more                definitive answer to the question of whether postural control abnormalities exist in                this population in the absence of any medications. However, as previously discussed,                this approach comes with its own set of difficulties, i.e. the possible confound of                acute clinical symptoms that have accompanying alterations in motor behavior.
In this current experiment, we do not have sufficient statistical power to clearly                delineate how individual medications and course of illness variables such as the                number of previous mood episodes could have affected postural control. This process                is complicated further by the potentially broad range of effects that different                combinations of medications prescribed to participants could have on motor function.                Further longitudinal research with a better controlled, much larger sample is                necessary in order to elucidate the different effects of various medications and                their combined effects on postural sway in BD. In addition, more comprehensive                information regarding the relationship between illness history and postural control                would be of interest. Overall, however, comparison of participants based on                categories of medication use does provide some evidence that the observed deficits                in motor function cannot be explained as being the effects of the psychotropic drugs                alone. It is possible that some interaction between the disorder and medications                negatively impacts postural control in BD.
Several limitations to the present study suggest caution should be exercised in                interpreting our results. Beyond medication use, several additional sources of                sample variance in the BD group may have influenced the group differences that were                observed. A number of BD participants in this study had a history of alcohol abuse                or dependence, which could contribute to the observed differences between groups.                However, the observed pattern of results was unchanged when participants with                previous alcohol dependence were excluded. An additional source of variance is                inter-individual differences in illness history. Such course of illness variables                could be particularly relevant given that the number of previous acute mood episodes                in bipolar disorder has been associated with the degree of cerebellar atrophy [19], especially                in the posterior cerebellar vermis [13], [18], and with basal ganglia volume,                especially in the putamen [60], [81].
Overall, the evidence presented here is consistent with earlier findings of motor                abnormalities in BD [3], [5], [6], [7] and is consistent with the proposed deficits in the                cerebello-striatal-prefrontal circuit [1], [2]. Although the literature in this                area is limited, a picture is emerging in which mood and motor dysfunction are                comorbid pathophysiological features with closely overlapping core components.                Further research into the nature of motor abnormalities in BD is warranted, ideally                with never medicated or currently unmedicated participants. Structural and                functional neuroimaging studies conducted in conjunction with assessments of mood                state and motor performance would be particularly informative as to the existence                and characteristics of motor dysfunction in BD.
