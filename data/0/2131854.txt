RISE IN TEMPERATURE PRECEDING THE APPEARANCE OF SYMPTOMS IN EXPERIMENTAL POLIOMYELITIS

 The data presented in this paper offer a means of earlier recognition of experimental poliomyelitis in the monkey. The early appearance of the temperature rise (1 to 3 days before the onset of the usual recognizable symptoms) associated with spinal fluid changes suggests that there is a stage in the experimental disease corresponding to preparalytic human poliomyelitis.
