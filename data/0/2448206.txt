Mortality rates of patients admitted to a psychogeriatric assessment unit.

Admission of elderly people to a geriatric hospital may carry an increased risk of death. In this study 355 admissions of 243 elderly persons with dementia to a purpose built psychogeriatric unit were studied and the mortality rate found to be 8.2%, which is less than that reported elsewhere. Admission for the purpose of respite (holiday) relief is a safe procedure and should not be discouraged.
