Acute appendicitis in young children in the Belfast urban area: 1985-1992.

Eighty-one cases of acute appendicitis in children aged less than six years were identified in the Belfast urban area between 1985 and 1992. Appendiceal perforation, found in 43%, was related to symptom duration but not to age at presentation. Prolongation of symptoms was related to parental delay in seeking medical advice (52% > 36 hours), delayed or inappropriate general practitioner referral to hospital (19%) and diagnostic delay following surgical consultation (12% > 12 hours). Diagnostic delay in hospital was usually the result of nonspecificity of symptoms and signs and was therefore largely unavoidable. Delayed referral from general practice did not contribute unnecessarily to appendiceal perforation, and given that an individual general practitioner will see a case of preschool appendicitis once in 30 years, diagnostic accuracy was remarkably high.
