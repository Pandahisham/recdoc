Evidence of Chlamydia infection in a Belfast antenatal population.

Chlamydia trachomatis is an important cause of postpartum endometritis and neonatal conjunctivitis. However, the prevalence of chlamydial genital infection varies considerably from one population group to another. A study was thus conducted to determine the incidence of C trachomatis infection of the cervix in an unselected group of women attending a Belfast antenatal clinic. One hundred and six patients were screened for evidence of current cervical infection with C trachomatis or serological evidence of past infection. C trachomatis was identified in 2.9%, and there was evidence of past infection in 18.9%. No significant risk factors were identified from gynaecological, contraceptive or sexual histories. C trachomatis infection was treated with erythromycin and there were no perinatal complications ascribed to chlamydia.
