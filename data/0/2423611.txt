The finding of adenomatous polyps of the gallbladder is a rare occurrence and an unusual clinicalproblem.
Among 2,145 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease only 9 (0.4 per cent)presented with adenomatous polyps. There were 6 women and 3 men, aged 17 to 70 years. Preoperativeultrasonographic diagnosis was made in only 1 of 7 patients with gallstones, in contrast polypoid lesionswithin a gallbladder without stones were easily confirmed by both ultrasonography and oral cholecystographyin the remaining 2 patients. All polyps were 1.0 cm or less in size and without histologic evidenceof malignant change. The clinical significance of this rare condition is discussed, with particularreference to a possible role in development of gallbladder carcinoma. Surgical treatment should beadvocated regardless of clinical manifestation when the polyp exceeds 1.0 cm in diameter or rapidgrowth of the lesion is seen on ultrasonographic follow-up examinations.
