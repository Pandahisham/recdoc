DELUSIONAL PARASITOSIS OF BODY ORIFICES - A CULTURAL VARIANT?

Predominant or specific involvement of the eyes, ears, nostrils, mouth, anus and urethra (the body orifices) has not previously been reported in the literature on delusional parasitosis. Their involvement in the cases reported here is discussed in the context of the Hindu religio-cultural belief system which attaches special significance to these organs in the personal quest for physical, mental and spiritual purity. The involvement of the ears, in particular, appears to be influenced by native healing methods.
