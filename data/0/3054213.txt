CNS innervation of the urinary bladder demonstrated by immunohistochemical study for c-fos and pseudorabies virus.

The aim of the present study is to verify the functional and anatomical neural pathways which innervate the urinary bladder in the central nervous system of the rat. To identify the functional neural pathway, the urinary bladder was stimulated by infusing formalin for 2 h. Then, brain and spinal cord were dissected out and immunohistochemistry was done by using anti-c-fos antibody. Many c-fos immunoreactive (IR) neurons were identified in the telencephalic cortical areas and in several brainstem nuclei, which are known mostly to be related with urinary bladder. In the spinal cord, a number of c-fos IR neurons were found in the lamina I, IIo, dorsal gray commissure, sacral parasympathetic nucleus. To identify the anatomical neural pathway of the urinary bladder, Pseudorabies virus (PRV) was injected into the wall of urinary bladder and was identified with anti-PRV by using immunohistochemistry. Most PRV labeled neurons were found where c-fos IR neurons were identified and few of them were also in the areas where c-fos IR neurons were not found, e.g., prefrontal cortex, agranular insular cortex, and subfornical organ. In the spinal cord, PRV labeled cells were found all over the gray matter. The present study presents morphological evidence demonstrating the supraspinal areas are related with the neural control of the urinary bladder and most functional neural pathway of the urinary bladder is well consistent with the anatomical neural pathway except in some telencephalic cortical areas.
