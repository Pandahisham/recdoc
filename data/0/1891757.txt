Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Primary Osteoporosis


There is increased awareness of the need for cardiovascular (CVS) risk monitoring in the Northern Ireland population in general, and amongst rheumatoid arthritis and SLE patients in particular, who have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease. No clear guidelines exist for cardiovascular risk monitoring in osteoporosis, and the prevalence and associations of known CVS risk factors are largely unquantified.
To estimate current levels of CVS risk monitoring in primary osteoporosis patients, and then perform a CVS risk assessment, together with measures of bone health, bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk.
History and examination of 80 patients at a dedicated multidisciplinary osteoporosis clinic at Musgrave Park Hospital, together with BMD measurement and blood sampling for lipids, glucose and urate measurement.
80 primary osteoporosis patients (10 male, 70 female, median age 67.0 years (95%CI 65.0-70.0), median onset 63.0 years, (95%CI 60.0-65.0)) were assessed. 57 (71%) recalled a blood pressure check in the previous year, but just 35 (43.8%) had received a lipid check, and only 26 (32.5%) a test for diabetes. 8 patients had systolic blood pressure (BP) >160mmHg, and 7 diastolic BP >90mmHg (definitely hypertensive). 31 (38.8%) had systolic BP >140mmHg and 41 (51.1%) had diastolic BP>80mmHg) (borderline hypertension). 14 (17.5%) of patients had already been diagnosed with angina, myocardial infarction or stroke.
There was a striking and previously unreported relationship between diastolic BP and having suffered a low trauma fracture. Patients without fracture (n=38) had a median diastolic BP of 70.0 (95%CI 65.9-76.1) compared with 85.0 (95%CI 80.0-88.0) in patients who had sustained at least one fracture (n=42) (p<0.001). There was no relationship with diastolic BP and steroid or bisphosphonate use.
There was also a previously unreported correlation between lower HDL levels and BMD at the hip (r=âˆ’0.28, p=0.02). Hip BMD in patients with HDL<1.5 v HDL>1.5 0.765 (95%CI 0.731-0.823) v 0.726 (95%CI 0.624-0.785), p=0.05. There was no relation with statin use. Overall, 38 (47.5%) patients had cholesterol levels >5.2 mmol/l, and just 14 patients were taking lipid lowering therapy.
There is a substantial unmet need for cardiovascular risk assessment in primary osteoporosis, in which cardiovascular disease is common. There are potentially interesting links between hypertension and lipid abnormalities and some aspects of bone health, which merit further investigation. All these patients will have regular CVS monitoring at our clinic.
