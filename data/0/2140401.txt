QUANTITATIVE LAWS IN REGENERATION. II

 This paper contains the results of a reexamination of a law expressed in a previous paper; namely, that when a piece of stem inhibits the growth of shoots and roots in a leaf connected with it the dry weight of the stem increases and that this gain equals approximately the mass of shoots and roots the leaf would have produced if it had been detached from the stem. This has been confirmed and it has been shown that the gain of the stem as a rule even exceeds slightly the mass of shoots and roots the leaf would have produced if it had not been inhibited by the stem. This supports the idea that the inhibitory influence of the stem upon the formation of roots and shoots in the leaf is due to the fact that the material available and required for this process naturally flows into the stem.
