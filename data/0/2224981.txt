THE SOURCE OF LIPID ACCUMULATION IN L CELLS

 Strain L cells accumulate lipid, concurrent with cessation of protein synthesis, in the stationary phase of growth from the extracellular medium and as a result of de novo synthesis. Cells which have been more severely damaged with an amino acid analogue also accumulate lipid from the extracellular medium, but synthesize very little lipid from labeled acetate. The possible roles which lipid accumulation may play in the cell are discussed.
