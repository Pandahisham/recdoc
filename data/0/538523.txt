Initiative for Developing Evidence-based Standardization of Traditional Chinese Medical Therapy in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization


In recognition of the potential benefits of traditional medicine to the world's population, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Traditional Medicine Program under the motto of ‘Health for All by the Year of 2000’ over three decades ago (The Declaration of Alma-Ata resolved from the International Conference on Primary Health Care by WHO–UNICEF in Alma-Ata, USSR in 1978). Since then, WHO itself has formulated numerous projects with traditional medicines, and urged its Member States to initiate their own programs and subsequent implementation on the national level of health care programs and systems. To promote and facilitate such polices in the Western Pacific Region of the WHO, where China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and many island countries scattered in the Pacific Ocean are located, the Regional Office designated the WHO Collaboration Centers for Traditional Medicine Research in China, Japan and Korea to provide international cooperation among countries with interest in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM does not necessarily represent the traditional medicine of the People's Republic of China, rather the comprehensive traditional medicines of China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam, and other countries whose peoples have commonly shared in the historical development of TCM and still include some traditional medical therapies in their medical care system.
The meeting was held at the WHO Collaborating Center which has been located in the Natural Products Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea (hereafter NPRI Center) since its designation in 1979. This institution facilitated two major initiatives for providing global standardization of TCM: (i) a proposal for establishment of the Forum on Harmonization of Herbal Medicines; and (ii) a proposal for development of the Treatment Guideline on Evidence-based Traditional Medicine.
Following the agenda on the quality standard of herbal materials and preparations, an epoch on the milestone of modernizing TCM therapy, an initiative was introduced for establishing guidelines of standard therapy practiced in TCM. There have been two serious stumbling blocks; one is a lack of standard diagnostic methodology for various diseases and syndromes in TCM practice. Therefore, each TCM doctor can diagnose subjectively with disease and syndromes. Consequently, poorly repeatable diagnoses can be made. Such a lack of standard methodology may produce a ‘trial and error’ therapy in practice. In this situation, one can hardly expect a standard guideline for TCM therapy. In order to work out these problems, the NPRI Center proposed that the Regional Office should formally invite an expert working group meeting and discuss issues on examining the feasibility of establishing a standard guideline for TCM therapy. Immediate action was taken by the Regional Office, and the expert meeting with the title of ‘The Informal Consultation on the Development of Treatment Guidelines on Evidence-based Traditional Medicine’ organized by the Regional Office and the NPRI Center was held in Seoul on May 27–29, 2004. Experts from TCM and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), regulatory agencies, conventional medical (Western medicine) and traditional medical educational institutes, governmental policy makers from China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the USA and a special group of editorial staff members from eCAM gathered and produced the following outcome, summarized as follows.
To develop treatment guidelines for evidence-based TM, participants from China, Japan and Korea submitted lists of target diseases based on their own TM development strategies. Since all countries were not represented, a list of diseases was submitted by the Regional Office to include the whole western Pacific region.

To pursue evidence-based scientific assessment
The content of evidence
The quality of evidence
Standardization of clinical practice
For achievement of reliability
For achievement of reproducibility
Selection of Guideline topics
Specific diseases
In terms of traditional classification
In terms of modern classification
Rationale for using traditional medicine
Limited availability and efficacy of modern (Western, orthodox) therapy
Socioeconomic factors (high cost of modern therapies)
Urgency and benefits of evaluating new treatments derived from traditional medical therapy
Based on the above recommendation, the Regional Office took prompt action as the first step to organize an expert working group meeting in Beijing in October, 2004, on common TCM terminology that is essential for developing the Guidelines.
CAM has evolved as a part of conventional medicine over the past decade. TCM is playing an important role in CAM, and it is an urgent task to develop a global standard of TCM practice and herbal medicines as well as for mutual recognition and understanding. To achieve the goal, efforts have been made to push forward with the standardization of TCM by international collaboration through the WHO's activities.
