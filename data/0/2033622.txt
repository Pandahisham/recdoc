The cytotoxic activity of Taxol in primary cultures of tumour cells from patients is partly mediated by Cremophor EL.

In patient tumour samples the activity in vitro of Taxol corresponded fairly well to the known clinical activity and Taxol showed low cross-resistance to standard cytotoxic drugs. However, the Taxol solvent Cremophor EL--ethanol was considerably active alone, whereas paclitaxel formulated in ethanol was less active. Taxol thus seems to contain two components active against patient tumour cells in vitro.
