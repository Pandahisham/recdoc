The epidemiology of premature aging and associated comorbidities

Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome and Werner syndrome, also known as childhood- andadulthood-progeria, respectively, represent two of the best characterized human progeroid diseaseswith clinical features mimicking physiological aging at an early age. The discovery of their geneticbasis has led to the identification of several gene mutations leading to a spectrum of progeroidphenotypes ranging from moderate and mild–severe to very aggressive forms. In parallel, thecreation of disease registers and databases provided available data for the design of relativelylarge-scale epidemiological studies, thereby allowing a better understanding of the nature andfrequency of the premature aging-associated signs and symptoms. The aim of this article is to reviewthe most recent findings concerning the epidemiology of premature aging disorders, their geneticbasis, and the most recent reports on the frequency of associated diseases.

Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Werner syndrome (WS) are two of the bestcharacterized human progeroid diseases with clinical features mimicking physiological aging at anearly age, the first being referred as to childhood progeria, and the latter as progeria ofadulthood.1 An increasing number of intermediateprogeroid phenotypes, known as atypical progeroid syndromes, atypical HGPS, or atypical WS, havebeen described.1 The aim of this review article isto describe the most recent findings concerning the epidemiology of premature aging disorders, theirgenetic basis, and the most recent reports on the frequency of associated diseases.
HGPS is an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting about one per four to eight million livebirths.2 More precisely, the reported prevalencerate of the disease is one in eight million births, but if unreported or misdiagnosed cases aretaken into account, the estimated birth prevalence is one in four million.2
According to the Progeria Research Foundation database (http://www.progeriaresearch.org/prf-by-the-numbersprf.html), there are an estimated200–250 children living with progeria worldwide at any one time, and 103 of them have beenidentified as of April 2013. Progeria affects both sexes and all races, and HGPS cases have beendiscovered in over 40 different countries. In particular, a map of ascertained HGPS children isavailable at the Progeria Research Foundation portal (http://www.fidtheother150.org/), and there are records of 20 cases in Northern America,16 cases in Central and Southern America, 24 cases in Europe and the Mediterranean regions, fourcases in Africa, and 18 cases in Asia.
The disease was named after the reports by Jonathan Hutchinson and Hastings Gilford, the doctorswho first described it in England, and it is classified as a segmental progeroid syndrome sincemultiple organs and tissues replicate phenotypes associated with normal aging.3,4
Children with HGPS appear healthy at birth but develop distinctive clinical features during thefirst years of their life, including severe growth retardation, usually associated with skeletalalteration as well as loss of subcutaneous fat and skin appendages, and some developmental processesare delayed (dentition) or absent.4 Death occurs inthose affected by their early teenage years, and usually results from heart attacks andstrokes.1
The majority of classical HGPS is caused by a de novo point mutation in exon 11 of theLMNA gene (c.1824C>T, p.G608G).5 The LMNA gene encodes A-type lamins, which are intermediate filamentproteins of the inner nuclear lamina. The c.1824C>T mutation results in the activation of acryptic splice donor site that removes 150 nucleotides from exon 11. The resulting laminA∆150 messenger ribonucleic acid gives rise to a lamin A isoform containing an internaldeletion of 50 amino acids, known as progerin (a protein that cannot undergo completematuration).5 Lamins constitute the major componentof the nuclear lamina; in addition to providing structure and shape to the nucleus, they areinvolved in organizing several processes including chromatin organization, deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA) replication, transcription, DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation, and DNA repair.6 Those mechanisms are impaired in HGPS and mightcontribute to the progeria phenotype. Indeed, cells obtained from HGPS patients show a markedlyreduced lifespan when grown in culture, and accumulate defects in nuclear structure and architecturewith cell passaging, including lobulation of the nuclear envelope, thickening of the nuclear lamina,loss of peripheral heterochromatin, and clustering of nuclear pores, which are accompanied by anincrease in the amount of progerin within the cells.7
A visible vein across the nasal bridge is often the first observable sign in HGPS infants. Aprofound failure to thrive occurs during the first year, usually from 6 months to 12 months. Onaverage, HGPS children gain 0.4–0.5 kg/year and reach a final weight of about 14–15kg and a final height of 110 cm. Progressive alopecia usually takes place within 6 months to 2years, and between the ages of 2 years and 3 years, most children become bald.8 Other symptoms become apparent during the first year to third year,including characteristic facies, loss of subcutaneous fat, stiffness of joints, bone changes, andabnormal tightness of the skin over the abdomen and upper thighs.1 With time, the skin becomes thin, dry, and atrophic, with reducedturgor and sometimes with hyperkeratosis. Small, light-brown spots frequently develop on the neckand upper thorax, and subsequently on the scalp and limbs. Typical facial abnormalities include areceding mandible, a small and beaked nose, prominent scalp veins, prominent eyes, and protrudingears that lack lobules. The facial characteristics gradually develop and both the face and bodychange with time: the subcutaneous fat in the face disappears completely and the facial musclesdecrease in size. The body shows increasing loss of subcutaneous fat and muscle bulk and the jointsprotrude.1,8,9 At the bone level,patients show clavicular hypoplasia, generalized osteopenia, and acroosteolyses of distal phalanges.Motor and mental development is normal, cognitive functions are preserved, and the children follow anormal psychosocial development and show normal behaviors for their age.1,9 Dentition is delayedand crowded.9 HGPS individuals have a high-pitchedvoice, do not reproduce, and their appearance becomes like that of an older person with time.1,8
Additional findings that are present in some but not all affected individuals include excessiveocular tearing, photophobia, exposure keratitis, and Raynaud’s phenomenon.9 Most children die in their early teens from heartattacks and strokes caused by progressive atherosclerotic disease, with myocardial infarctionrepresenting the most frequent cause of death at a mean age of around 13 years.8 A comprehensive description of most of the HGPS-associatedmanifestations is provided in the following sections.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the principal factor affecting mortality in HGPSindividuals, with death resulting from myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive cardiac failurein 75% of cases.10 Cardiovascular problems areabsent during the first 5 years of life, but children gradually develop shortness of breath withexertion and easy fatigability from the age of 6–8 years.10 Accelerated CVD leads to debilitating morbidity in HGPS andculminates in mortality from myocardial infarction or stroke at an average age of 13 years.11
The rapid progression of CVD in HGPS presents an opportunity to explore the natural history ofhuman CVD, and a study performed on 26 HGPS patients and 22 matched controls revealed that thecarotid–femoral pulse wave velocity was dramatically elevated in patients.11 Carotid duplex ultrasound echobrightness, assessed asa measure of arterial wall density, was significantly greater than age- and sex-matched controls inthe intima–media, near adventitia, and deep adventitia, as was internal carotid artery meanflow velocity.11 Overall, those data demonstratedthat, along with peripheral vascular occlusive disease, accelerated vascular stiffening is an earlyand pervasive mechanism of vascular disease in HGPS.11
Autopsy data have shown widespread atherosclerosis in HGPS patients. Particularly, advancedcoronary atherosclerotic lesions have been reported, and the arteries were frequently stenosed oroccluded by plaques or narrowing of intramural arteries. Occlusion of the right coronary artery,lesions of the left anterior descending artery, and severe atherosclerosis of the aorta, representcommon findings in HGPS.10 Valvular changes andpulmonary arterial lesions have also been reported in HGPS individuals.10
Cerebrovascular arteriopathy and stroke have been recently assessed by means of a neurovascularimaging cohort study of HGPS, a study aimed to identify the neurovascular features, infarct type,topography, and natural history of stroke.12 Atotal of 25 children with confirmed diagnoses of HGPS were included in the study, which revealed avasculopathy unique to HGPS, including distinctive intracranial stenoocclusive arterial lesions,basal cistern collateral vessels, and slow compensatory collateral flow over the cerebralconvexities. Moreover, the authors identified early and clinically silent strokes as a prevalentdisease characteristic in HGPS. Indeed, a radiographic evidence of infarction was found in 60% ofpatients, of which half were likely clinically silent.12
A recent study performed with an inducible and tissue-specific mouse model, which expresses themost common HGPS mutation (c.1824C>T) in osteoblasts and odontoblasts, revealed that theexpression of the HGPS mutation during osteoblast development results in a loss of osteocytes,irregular mineralization, and poor biomechanical properties.13
A comprehensive survey of the skeletal dysmorphisms observed in children with HGPS usingconventional radiography was obtained from 39 children with the classic HGPS genotype, representingapproximately 15%–20% of the world’s HGPS population.14 Small clavicles were observed in 100% of the patients; followed bycoxa valga and acroosteolysis, which were observed in more than 90% of the patients; and resorptionof the distal clavicles and narrow apices, both present in 82% of the subjects. Other frequentskeletal abnormalities were hip dysplasia (69%) and thin ribs (59%). In addition, 30% to 45% of thepatients showed resorption of the anterior ribs, closed sagittal suture, generalized osteopenia,focal cortical defects, flexed fingers, ulnar minus variant, or enlarged heart. Less frequent(20%–30%) were dystrophic calcification, sagittal suture diastasis, enlarged femoral head,pseudoarthrosis, enlarged femoral greater trochanter, and avascular necrosis of the proximal femur.Kyphoscoliosis, enlarged humoral head, narrowed humoral diaphysis, prominent pulmonary vessels, andwormian bones were reported in less than 15% of the patients, and other abnormalities, such asaccentuated osteopenia of proximal humoral/femoral epiphysis, rib fracture, Madelung deformity,ivory epiphyses, bifid rib, and congenitally fused ribs were reported in 10% or less of thepatients.14
Using the Progeria Research Foundation medical and research database (http://www.progeriaresearch.org/medical_database.html), data on 25 HGPS patients havebeen examined in order to provide an overview of the craniofacial abnormalities in progeria.15
Concerning scalp, calvarial, and skull base features, thinning of the calvarium was seen in 95%of the individuals, often accompanied by a paucity of scalp fat (91%). A mottled appearance of theskull was seen in 59% of the patients. Two individuals (8%) had skull fractures, and prominentvascular markings of the bony calvaria were observed in 90% of the subjects. Craniofacialdisproportion (a large cranium relative to the facial size), and a J-shaped sella were observed inalmost 90% of the patients, and a delayed closure of the anterior fontanel was seen in 56% ofthem.15
Concerning oral maxillary, zygomatic arch, and parotid gland features, the authors observed ashort mandibular ramus in 83% of the patients, with a gracile thin zygomatic arch in 50% of them. Ashallow glenoid fossa with a hypoplastic or absent articular eminence and flattening of themandibular condyle were seen in 43% of the patients. Moreover, 45% of the children had a V-shapedpalate, and 50% of them had disorganized dentition. A prominent parotid gland was seen in all thechildren analyzed.15
With regard to orbital features, hypotelorism was noted in 86% of the children, and kinking ofthe optic nerves was seen in 89%.15
Fifteen patients with HGPS have been enrolled in a prospective study to evaluate otologic andaudiologic manifestations.16 All patients hadstiff auricular cartilages, small or absent lobules, and hypoplasia of the lateral soft-tissueportion of the external ear canal leading to a shortened canal. A low-frequency conductive hearingloss in the 250 Hz to 500 Hz range was observed in 86.4% of the ears, despite largely normaltympanometry.16 In addition, 71% of the patientshad dry cerumen impaction, and 29% of them reported a history of recurrent otitis media.16
Insulin resistance occurs in about 50% of affected patients without progression to diabetesmellitus.9 A rare case of a 10-year-old boy withgenetically confirmed classical HGPS and hypoparathyroidism has been reported.17 Differently from other premature aging syndromes, such as WS orothers caused by mutations of DNA repair genes, there is no reported increase of cancer incidence inHGPS patients.8,18 Cataracts are not frequent.8 We recently reviewed neurodegenerative signs or symptoms in premature aging disorders, andthey are absent in HGPS individuals.1
Although the majority (approximately 90%) of classical HGPS is caused by a de novo point mutationin exon 11 of the LMNA gene (c.1824C>T, p.G608G), it was clear from thebeginning that other mutations in LMNA could cause a similar phenotype.5 Particularly, the genetic basis of HGPS was identifiedin 2003 by two independent research groups.5,19 Eriksson et al5 observed the G608G mutation in 90% of 20 HGPS individuals, and DeSandre- Giovannoli et al19 observed it in twoaffected children. A patient with a c.1822G>A mutation (p.G608S), with classical HGPS, wasalso recorded by Eriksson et al.5
The LMNA gene encodes the four different A-type lamins (lamin A, laminA∆10, lamin C, and lamin C2), which are intermediate filament proteins of the inner nuclearlamina.1 Lamin A (encoded by exons 1–12)and lamin C (encoded by exons 1–10) are the major proteins expressed in differentiatedcells. Lamin A∆10 is identical to lamin A except that it lacks exon 10 and has been detectedin cells from colon and placenta, in leukocytes and fibroblasts, and in tumor cells. Lamin C2 has analternative exon 1 compared with lamin C and is present in germ cells.1 Lamin A proteins contain CaaX boxes at their C-terminal ends; they aresynthesized as prelamin A proteins, which undergo farnesylation and other posttranslationalmodifications to become mature proteins (Figure1).
The p.G608G mutation results in the activation of a cryptic splice donor site, leading to theproduction of a lamin A isoform containing an internal deletion of 50 amino acids, known as progerin– a protein that cannot undergo complete maturation.5 Particularly, the deletion eliminates the site for endoproteoliticcleavage by zinc metalloproteinase Ste24 homolog (ZMPSTE24), a cleavage required for the productionof mature lamin A. The recurrent c.1824C>T mutation causing HGPS is a de novo dominant pointmutation, mostly originating on the paternal allele and often linked with advanced paternalage.5
The zinc metalloprotease, ZMPSTE24, plays a critical role in nuclear lamin biology by cleavingthe prenylated and carboxylmethylated 15-amino acid tail from the C-terminus of prelamin A to yieldmature lamin A (Figure 1). Two patients withextraordinarily severe forms of progeria caused by unusual mutations in LMNA havebeen described.20 Both mutations(IVS11+1G>A and p.V607V) resulted in a strong activation of the aberrant splice siteobserved in typical HGPS, leading to increased progerin expression compared to typical HGPScases.20 By contrast, two subjects bearing amissense (p.T623S) mutation leading to the deletion of 35 amino acids in exon 11 ofLMNA showed a less aggressive progeroid phenotype (slowly progressing progeria)compared to classical HGPS.21,22 Overall, the amount of toxic progerin in cellsappears to correlate with the severity of disease outcomes.20
Interestingly, recessive mutations in ZMPSTE24 also disrupt lamin A proteolyticprocessing and are associated with three distinct but related human diseases that share features ofpremature aging, with a gradation of severity.23Indeed, ZMPSTE24 mutations cause: (1) the mild progeroid disorder mandibuloacraldysplasia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation,craniofacial anomalies, skeletal malformations, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation; (2) a severeform of progeria denoted as atypical HGPS; and (3) restrictive dermopathy (RD), a fatal neonataldisorder characterized by severe intrauterine growth delay that can be considered as an“extreme form” of premature aging.23 Twenty human ZMPSTE24 alleles have been identified that are associatedwith those diseases. They have been recently reviewed by Barrowman et al,24 who demonstrated a correlation between decreasing ZMPSTE24 proteaseactivity and increasing disease severity. Particularly, complete loss-of-function alleles areassociated with RD, whereas retention of partial, measurable activity results in mandibuloacraldysplasia or severe progeria.23Figure 1 illustrates most of the knownLMNA and ZMPSTE24 mutations linked to progeroid diseases.
Although the mechanism whereby persistently farnesylated lamin A, either resulting fromLMNA or ZMPSTE24 mutations, causes premature aging phenotypes isunknown, changes in chromatin architecture and in histone methylation and gene expression, defectiveDNA repair and accumulation of DNA damage, impaired structural and mechanical properties of thenuclear lamina, and perturbations in transcription factors and nuclear proteins, are among thesuggested pathologic mechanisms.1,8
The diagnosis of HGPS is based on the recognition of common clinical features and the detectionof either the c.1824C>T (p.G608G) heterozygous LMNA mutation in the classicform of HGPS, or one of three of the heterozygous LMNA mutations in atypical HGPS:c.1822G>A (p.G608S), c.1821G>A (p.V607V), or c.1968+1G>A(IVS11+1G>A) (Figure 1).9 Noteworthy, several patients with atypical progeroidsyndromes, which have been referred to as atypical progeroid syndromes (also called atypical HGPS,nonclassical progeria, or atypical WS), do not carry LMNA splicing mutations, butother heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous mutations in the LMNAgene.24 The clinical features of those patientsinclude growth retardation and involve the same body systems (bones, body fat, skin, and hair) as inclassical HGPS, but the course and severity of the symptoms vary. The patients have differing agesof onset and symptom severity, with some nearly as severe as HGPS, others (such as p.R435C) leadingto atypically mild RD, but most are far less severe.24 For example, patients affected by atypical WS have early onset of aging phenotypes and anaccelerated rate of disease progression than typical WS individuals; they also commonly show absenceof bilateral cataracts and diabetes, which are common features in typical WS.25 Over 20 LMNA mutations causing atypical progeroidsyndromes have been discovered and have been recently reviewed by Doubaj et al;23 these are summarized in Figure 1.
In this regard, a dominantly inherited premature aging syndrome that includes prominentcardiovascular and cutaneous manifestations, called LMNA-associated cardiocutaneousprogeria syndrome, was recently described.26 Thedisease showed a later onset than classical HGPS, with skin manifestations of aging appearing in thethird decade of life. Affected individuals also developed CVD leading to death in their fourthdecade. One affected individual in this family also showed primary malignancies not previouslyreported in LMNA-linked progeria disorders. This atypical progeroid syndrome wascaused by a novel LMNA mutation (c.899A>G, p.D300G) leading toabnormalities of the nuclear membrane architecture.26
There is also indication from studies in nonagenarians suggesting that commonLMNA polymorphisms and haplotypes may play a role in the human lifespan.27 In this regard, Rodríguez and Eriksson28 have recently observed that an LMNAsingle nucleotide polymorphism (rs4641) results in low and high expressing alleles of theLMNA gene, and might account for the variability in phenotype seen among HGPSindividuals.28 Noteworthy, not allLMNA mutations cause progeria. More than 450 mutations of the gene have beendescribed causing several different autosomal dominant or recessive diseases collectively calledprimary laminopathies, and these include muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, neuropathies,cardiomyopathies, and the above-discussed segmental progeroid syndromes.26,29
WS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder also called adult progeria, and represents the moststudied disease model of premature aging in adulthood.30 In the Japanese population, a founder effect has been described, and the frequency of WShas been roughly estimated to be 1:100,000.30Another cluster of WS has been identified in Sardinia, with 18 described cases due to a foundereffect.31 The prevalence of heterozygous carriersin Japan is approximately 1/167, and it is estimated to be approximately 1/120 in Sardinia.31 Outside of Japan the disease prevalence is estimatedto be approximately 1:1,000,000–1:10,000,000.30
The syndrome was first described in the doctoral thesis of Werner32 in 1904. According to a recent report, 1,487 WS cases have beenrecorded from 1904 to the end of 2008 – 1,128 in Japan and 359 outside Japan.33 The patients develop features reminiscent ofpremature aging beginning in the second decade of life, including grey hair, alopecia, prematurelyaged face with beaked nose, skin atrophy with scleroderma-like lesions, ischemic heart disease,osteoporosis, bilateral cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, lipodystrophy, and hypogonadism. Theyalso experience an increased risk of cancers, and in most cases, they die because of malignanttumors or arteriosclerosis during the fourth and fifth decades of life.30
The disease is caused by mutations of the WRN gene, which encodes the WRNprotein, a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family.34 WRN is a multifunctional nuclear protein that maintains genome stability by means ofDNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), 3′→5′ helicase,3′→5′ exonuclease, and DNA strand annealing activities.35 Most of the WRN mutations result in the productionof truncated proteins lacking the nuclear localization signal, with the subsequent absence offunctional WRN protein in nuclei.36 WRN hasseveral functional domains and is considered to be a “caretaker of the genome” sinceit participates in distinct DNA metabolic pathways, including DNA replication, DNA recombination,telomere maintenance, apoptosis, and DNA repair.36Cells isolated from WS individuals display increased chromosomal aberrations and prematuresenescence in culture, as well as accelerated telomere shortening and several defects in DNAreplication.37
In 20% of cases, WS is not caused by WRN gene mutations, but often by mutationsin the LMNA gene.25 As discussedin the previous section of this paper, WS caused by LMNA mutations is referred toas atypical Werner’s syndrome.25
The lack of a pubertal growth spurt during the teen years is the first clinical sign in WSindividuals, leading to a characteristic short stature and low bodyweight. A recent analysis of 196WS Japanese cases reported that mean height and bodyweight were 158.3 cm and 45.3 kg for malepatients, and 148.5 cm and 37.7 kg for female patients, respectively.38 In their 20s and 30s, WS individuals begin to manifest alopecia,greying hair, and scleroderma-like skin changes, followed by bilateral cataracts, type 2 diabetesmellitus, hypogonadism, skin ulcers, and osteoporosis.1
A recent epidemiological study of 196 cases revealed that greying or loss of hair, bird-likefaces, cataracts, and skin atrophy were present in 93% to 99%.38 Other common features were clavus or callus, skin ulcers, flat foot,abnormality of the voice, and calcification in the Achilles tendon, observed in 80%–90% ofthe subjects.38 Similarly, a trend analysis inJapanese WS individuals revealed that bird-like faces and a stocky trunk with extremely thinextremities are still a hallmark of the disease, but the body size, which is also still small, hasbeen expanding in recent years, in concert with the growing constitution of the general Japanesepopulation, and some patients exceeded 177 cm in height and weighed over 70 kg.33
Abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, hypogonadism, and bone deformity appear by the fourthdecade of life in WS subjects.38 Impaired glucosetolerance is reported in 15%–20% of WS subjects, diabetes mellitus in 55%–70%, anddyslipidemia in 60%–85%.38 Fertility in WSpatients appears to decline soon after sexual maturity, and hypogonadism has been reported in 40% ofboth sexes.38 Osteoporosis was observed in morethan 60% of WS cases, while osteoarthritis has not been frequently reported in WS.33,38
For several years, the clinical diagnosis of WS was based on the presence of four cardinal signs(cataracts, skin changes, short stature, and greying or loss of hair), which are observable in morethan 95% of the cases, as well as on additional signs (osteoporosis, voice change, atherosclerosis,type 2 diabetes mellitus, and so on). For a definite diagnosis, all the cardinal signs (onset over10 years old) and two additional signs should have been present. In addition, sequencing of theWRN gene could be performed, and the absence of normal WRN protein would beconfirmed by Western blot analysis.4,35
Following more recent observations, revised diagnostic criteria have been proposed,38 including the following cardinal signs and symptoms(onset over 10 years until 40 years of age): (1) progeroid changes of the hair (gray hair, baldness,and so on); (2) cataracts (bilateral); (3) changes of the skin (atrophic skin, tight skin, clavus,callus); (4) soft-tissue calcification (Achilles tendon, and so on); (5) bird-like face; and (6)abnormal voice (high-pitched, squeaky, hoarse). Additional signs include abnormal glucose and/orlipid metabolism, deformation and abnormality of the bone (osteoporosis, and so on), malignanttumors, parental consanguinity, premature atherosclerosis, hypogonadism, short stature, and lowbodyweight. The diagnosis is confirmed if all the cardinal signs are present, or if there is a genemutation in addition to at least three cardinal signs, and suspected if two or more cardinal signsare present, or if 1–2 cardinal signs in addition to other signs, are present.38
An unusual spectrum of cancers has been observed in WS subjects who usually die at a mean age of53–54 years from cancer or arteriosclerosis.30 Controversy exists regarding the degree of brain involvement in WS.1 A discussion of recent reports of cancer, atherosclerosis, and nervoussystem disorders in WS will be provided in the following sections.
Complications caused by atherosclerosis and cancer represent the major cause of death in WSsubjects. Arteriosclerosis obliterans has been observed in more than 20% of WS subjects, andcoronary heart disease in 11%–16% of them.38 Less frequent are cerebral hemorrhage and cerebral infarction, observed in 2%–5%of cases.38 According to recent trend analyses,atherosclerosis in WS subjects might result from either abnormal lipid metabolism, or frominflammatory mechanisms.33
Concerning the cancer incidence in WS individuals, 339 (23%) out of the 1,487 WS cases describedup to the end of 2008 were diagnosed with cancer,33 and a nationwide epidemiological study carried out in Japan from 2009 to 2011 revealedthat cancer occurred in more than 40% of the 196 analyzed WS cases.38 Cancer in WS individuals often manifests with early age of onset, ahigh frequency of specific tumor types, including uncommon tumor types and unusual tumor sites, andwith the presence of multiple tumors in individual patients.39
Lauper et al39 have recently provided adetailed and quantitatively rigorous view of cancer type and associated type-specific risk in WS.Frequent neoplasms included: thyroid neoplasms (16.1%), malignant melanoma (13.3%), meningioma(10.9%), soft tissue sarcomas (10.1%), hematologic/lymphoid cancers (9.3%), and osteosarcomas(7.7%). Other cancers, including nonmelanoma skin cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, ovarian cancer,genitourinary tract cancers, hepatobiliary cancer, head and neck carcinomas, and breast cancer, wereobserved in 3%–5% of the cases. Less frequent cancers (1%–2%) were those of the lungand central nervous system, as well as adrenocortical carcinomas.39 A trend analysis in Japan revealed that the average age of onset ofmalignancy in WS increased from 37 years old in 1966 to 49 years old in 2008.33
We recently reviewed neurological abnormalities in premature aging disorders, and they are notconstant findings in WS.1 Brain atrophy has beenobserved in 40% of WS patients, but only a few cases of dementia or peripheral neuropathy have beenreported. A few cases of dementia have been recorded, but the analysis of amyloid beta pep-tide andhyperphosphorylated tau protein (the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s dementia) revealed that WSindividuals do not usually appear to be susceptible to Alzheimer’s disease.1 Myelopathy, demyelinization, and associated centraland/or peripheral neuropathy have been described in at least six patients.40–44Schizophrenia of the paranoia type was also recorded in about 10% of patients.33
Typical WS is an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Therefore, the parents of a proband areobligate heterozygotes for a disease-causing mutation, and at conception each sibling of an affectedindividual has a 25% chance of being affected and a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier.Classical WS is caused by mutations of the WRN gene on chromosome 8. The locusspans approximately 250 kb and consists of 35 exons.34
More than 70 WRN gene mutations have been found in WS patients; these are mainlynonsense mutations, insertions, and/or deletions, as well as splice mutations resulting in theproduction of truncated proteins lacking the nuclear localization signal, with subsequent absence offunctional WRN protein in nuclei.36,45 The WRN protein has several functional domains (Figure 2), and mutations leading to WS have been observedin all of them. There are founder mutations reported among Japanese patients (c.3139-1G>C,which results in skipping of exon 26) and in Sardinian patients (c.2089-3024A>G, whichcreates a new exon between exons 18 and 19).30,31 Potential founder mutations havebeen reported for Dutch (c.3590delA, p.N1197fs), Turkish (c.3460-2A>G, exon 30 deletion),and Moroccan (c.2179dupT, p.C727fs) patients.36The most common mutation in Caucasians is a stop codon mutation in exon 9 (c.1105C>T,p.R369X), accounting for approximately 20% of the mutations.45 Genetic screening combined with Western blot analysis are performedas routine diagnostic tests, and Figure 2 shows themost frequent mutations observed by ethnic group.
Advancements in our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of premature aging disordershave led to a better understanding of the onset and progression of the clinical manifestations. Theyinclude, for example, the recent discovery of high- and low-expressing LMNA allelesthat might account for the different phenotypes observed in HGPS patients, a better characterizationof the mutations leading to impaired or completely absent ZMPSTE24 protein activity, or those in theLMNA gene leading to atypical HGPS, overall accounting for a spectrum of disordersranging from neonatal progeria to atypical WS.20–28
In parallel, the advancements in diagnostic examination techniques, and the creation of diseaseregisters or databases allowing large case–control epidemiological studies in both HGPS andWS patients, have led to a better understanding of the epidemiology of disease-associated signs andsymptoms. This has led, for example, to a proposed revision of the clinical diagnostic criteria forWS, to the discovery that cerebral infarctions in HGPS are more frequent than expected, and to abetter understanding of cancer incidence in WS, among others.12,38,39
Treatments for HGPS and WS are only available for the symptoms rather than for the diseaseitself. For example, aggressive treatment of skin ulcers, cholesterol-lowering drugs if the lipidprofile is abnormal, control of type 2 diabetes mellitus, surgical treatment of cataracts, andtreatment of malignancies in a standard fashion are among the available medicaments in WS, which areoften accompanied by dietary/physical regimens to reduce atherosclerosis risk.1
Similarly, drugs, dietary changes, and exercise are recommended for HGPS individuals tocounteract atherosclerosis risk, body fat reduction, and atrophy of muscles.1 Interestingly, the results of the first clinical trial in HGPS revealedthat lonafarnib, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, resulted in better hearing, improved bonestructure, and led to gaining additional weight and/or to increased flexibility of the bloodvessels.46 In this regard, recent trend analysesin Japanese WS patients are extremely important,33as they showed a delayed onset of typical progeroid phenotypes in WS, which may be explained by theenvironmental changes including lifestyle and medical improvements, thereby offering a potential forinterventional trials.
It is clear from that survey that, in recent years, there has been a trend toward an increase inbody size in WS patients, as well as a delayed average age at onset of malignancies that follow therapid improvement and changes in the average lifespan and lifestyle in the general population allover the world.33 The future will be to combinegenetic, diagnostic, and epidemiological data in order to clarify several of thesegene–environment interactions and their relevance to the onset of disease-related symptoms.In addition, as recently shown by some authors studying HGPS patients,28 a deeper characterization of the genetics of prematurely agedindividuals might help to explain and predict the onset and progression of some of the symptoms,since several of these symptoms might result from the combined presence of different mutations inthe same or different genes, thereby opening a window for personalized interventions.
