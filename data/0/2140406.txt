DYNAMICS OF NERVE CELLS 

 In the case of the heart of Limulus polyphemus the same magnitude and variation of the temperature coefficient (Q10) is obtained from the whole heart as from the ganglion alone. From the magnitude of the temperature coefficients and their variation with changes of temperature we may conclude that the rate of the heart beat is determined by alteration of chemical processes in the ganglion cells.
