Tuberculosis of the female external genitalia is unusual and primary     infection is rare. We report a 50-year-old female patient admitted to     Department to Surgery with swelling over left inguinal area with discharging sinus from labia majora to left inguinal crease which was found to be tubercular sinus on histopathology.

Tuberculosis (TB) of the vulva and vagina is very rareand it is seen in only 1-2% of genital tract TB. Tuberculosis of cervix accountsfor 0.1–0.65% of all cases of TB and 5–24% of genital tract TB [1–8].Tuberculosis more frequently affects the upper genital tract, namely, thefallopian tubes and endometrium. It usually occurs in women of childbearing age[5, 6, 9].
A 50-year-old female patient without active sexual lifeadmitted to  Department to Surgery with a swelling over the left inguinal area with discharging sinus from labia majora to left inguinal crease. She had history of incision and drainage for anabscess at left labia majora 6 months back. She had no history of cough, fever,or abdominal pain. She had not been in close contact with an index case of pulmonary tuberculosisin past year. Antibody tests for HIV and VDRL infection were negative.
Chest and abdominal X-rays were normal.Ultrasonography revealed that the uterus was bulky and endometrial line was notvisualized and bilateral adnexae were without a mass or cyst. A full blood count showed leucopenia,and ESR at 2 hours was 55.
Then patient underwent excision of the sinus tract oflabia through suprapubic approach after staining it with methylene blue. A massof 6×5 cm was excised in the retropubic region (see Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 2). Histopathology report showed sinus tract lined by chronic inflammatory cells, epitheloid cells,and Langhan’s giant cells on microscopic examination suggestive of tuberculoussinus (Figure 3). Antitubreculous quadrupletherapy was initiated. Complete healing of the wound, with rapid relief ofsymptoms, followed 4-week antituberculosis chemotherapy.
Tuberculosis is one of the oldest diseases known toaffect humans [10]. Female genital TB is a rare disease insome developing countries, but it is a frequent cause of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) andinfertility in other parts of the world [11]. Symptomatic genital tract TBusually presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding, menstrual irregularities,abdominal pain, and constitutional symptom [5, 6, 9, 12, 13]. Pelvic organs are infected from a primary focus, usually the chest, by haematogenous spread [2, 4, 5, 12, 14]. The cervix is infected as part of this process, by lymphatic spread or bydirect extension. The vagina and vulva are rarely involved. The primary lesionis often healed by the time of presentation [5–9, 12–15].
Chowdhury [5]has suggested that sputum, used as a sexual lubricant, may also be a route oftransmission. It is uncommon for tuberculosis to involve the vulva and vagina.
The gross appearance may be ulcerative with multiplesinuses, it may be hypertrophic with elephantiasis, or it may be similar tothat of carcinoma. There may be hormone dependence of infection [2, 5] given that 80% of cases occur in the reproductive age.
Microscopically, there are caseating granulomatas. These arenot diagnostic. The differential diagnosis for granulomatous disease of thecervix includes amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, brucellosis, tularaemia,sarcoidosis, and foreign body reaction. The diagnosis of the cervical andvulvovaginal TB is usually made by histological examination of cervical andvulvovaginal biopsy specimen [3, 9, 14]. Staining for acid-fast bacilli was notfound to be very useful in making the diagnosis [16]. The detection ofgranulomata on cervical cytology specimens [9, 14] has been documented.Isolation of the mycobacterium is the gold standard for diagnosis. One third ofcases are culture negative. Therefore, the presence of typical granulomata issufficient for diagnosis if other causes of granulomatous cervicitis areexcluded or primary focus identified. The lesion should respond to 6 months ofstandard therapy. A lesion on the cervix, vagina, or vulva provides a marker toassess response to therapy. Histological examination of serial biopsy specimenscan similarly confirm a therapeutic response.
