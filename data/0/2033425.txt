Prevalence of human papillomavirus DNA sequences in an area with very high incidence of cervical carcinoma.

To improve our understanding of the relationship and possible associations between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the development of cervical malignancies, the presence of multiple types of HPV DNA sequences in cervical carcinoma was determined in Chinese citizens living in two different geographical locations where the incidences of cervical carcinoma are either relatively low or extremely high. HPV DNA sequences were found in 88.5% (54 of 61) of Chinese cervical carcinoma patients living in Taiwan, where the prevalence of cervical carcinoma is 23.7 per 100,000 women. In contrast, in LueYang in Shanxi province, an area with a very high prevalence of cervical carcinoma (1,026 per 100,000 women), only 57.1% (28 of 49) of Chinese cervical carcinoma patients were found to be infected with genital HPV. This result seems to suggest that either the presence of HPV may have different implications in different populations or HPV infection may not be the only factor that determines the development of cervical carcinoma, at least in certain geographical areas. Recently acquired transient or chronic persistent HPV infection may have a different outcome with regard to cervical carcinogenesis. Alternatively, other factors, such as host determinants, may play a role in the development of cervical carcinoma.
