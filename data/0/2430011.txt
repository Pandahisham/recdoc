Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT) has a very poor prognosis. This report illustrates novel chemotherapy and local control interventions in a 5-year old patient. The patient was treated in the outpatient setting, achieved remission, with excellent quality of life. The patient presented with massive ascites and >1000 abdominal tumors. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy included vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), ifosfamide (3 g/m2/day × 3), dexrazoxane/doxorubicin (750/75 mg/m2), and etoposide (150 mg/m2). Continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) was given after extensive cytoreductive surgery. This was followed by irinotecan (10 mg/m2/day × 5 × 2 weeks) + temozolomide monthly × 2, then abdominal radiation 30 Gy with simultaneous temozolomide (100 mg/m2/day × 5). A total of 12 cycles of irinotecan and temozolamide were given. Except for initial chemotherapy, subsequent courses were in the outpatient setting. Focal retroperitoneal relapse at 18 months was treated with IMRT with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) and 2 perihepatic metastases with radio frequency ablation/cryoablation followed by chronic outpatient maintenance chemotherapy (valproic acid, cyclophosphamide, and rapamycin).  Almost 2 years from diagnosis, the patient maintained an excellent quality of life. This is a novel approach to the treatment of children with massive abdomino-pelvic DSRCT.

DSRCT is an aggressive neoplasm usually involving numerous peritoneal metastases. It can also occur in different locations including the intrathoracic cavity, pleura, paratesticular,and soft tissues. A specific recurring t(11;22) translocation involving EWS andWT-1 is a characteristic [1]. Since the initial description ofDSRCT by Gerald and Rosai [2] in 1991, significant progress hasbeen made in its pathologic identification and diagnosis. However, despitemultiple treatment strategies among them, several chemotherapy regimens activefor Ewing's sarcoma, aggressive debulking surgery,whole abdominal radiation, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem celltransplant, DSRCT survival has not significantly improved. Despite much time in the hospital andmorbidity of interventions, durable remissions remain rare. Preliminary datasupports the combination of standard treatment modalities with continuous hyperthermicperitoneal perfusion (CHPP) in adult patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis [3–6]. Thus, CHPP may be a rational approachto improve local control of patients with DSRCT [7]. Experience with active chemotherapy agents forDSRCT in the outpatient clinic and also home infusion settings are presentedhere.
A 5-year old patient presented to an outsideinstitution with one-week history of abdominal pain and severe constipation notimproved with laxatives. Worsening of symptoms and abdominal distention promptedadditional evaluation. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated extensive peritoneal masses(6 cm right lower abdomen; 5 cm between rectum and bladder, 8 cm pelvic floorabove the bladder), peritoneal and omental implants (estimated number ofmetastases >1000), and massive ascites. There were many perihepatic lesions,but no obvious tumors within the liver. The patient was referred to MD AndersonCancer Center, Children's Cancer Hospital. An exploratorylaparotomy was done for biopsy and staging purposes; ascites was drained and atemporary peritoneal catheter for ascites removal was placed. The tumor waslimited to the abdominal cavity. Other organs had no evidence of disease.Histologic exam of the ascities fluid demonstrated some DSRCT cells in abackground of lymphocytosis.
Pathology of tumor biopsies (see Figure 1) showed features of a highly anaplastic and somewhat pleomorphic small bluecell malignancy. The immunohistochemical profile included: EMA 4+ in 75% of neoplastic cells with cytoplasmic(granular) pattern; Vimentin: 4+ in 95% of neoplastic cells with cytoplasmicfinely and coarsely granular pattern, CD-99/Myc-2 2+ immunoreactivity in 30% ofneoplastic cells cytoplasmic and granular pattern, Desmin 4+ in 95% of tumor cells, Myogenin(-), SMA (-), Bcl-2 (-), CD3 (-), CD20 (-), Synaptophysin (-), Chromogranin(-). Cytogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of t(11;22)(p15;q12)by FISH characteristicof DSRCT.
					Figure 2 shows a sequence of Neoadjuvantand adjuvant chemotherapy. First cycle was vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (2.2 g/m2), and doxorubicin (75 mg/m2)as an inpatient. Subsequent chemotherapywas outpatient and used a modified “VIDE” regimen similar to EuroEwings protocols everythree weeks in 4 cycles. Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 was followed bydexrazoxane (750 mg/m2 IV over 15 minutes) + doxorubicin (75 mg/m2 IV over 15 minutes) and etoposide (150 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour). Ifosfamide(3 g/m2) was mixed with MESNA (3 g/m2/day) in volume of240 mL normal saline and given as a continuous infusion × 3 days (total dose 9 g/m2) followed by 1 day of MESNA (3 g/m2). Pegfilgrastim wasgiven after completion of MESNA when port was deaccessed by the home healthnurse.
Day 1 chemotherapy was given in theoutpatient clinic; ifosfamide infusions were done at home with bagchanges by home health nursing.The patient had excellent performance and attended elementary school. Justprior to local control surgery, an additional cycle consisting of vincristineand liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg/m2 IV over 3 hours with hands andfeet on ice to reduce risk of palmar/plantar erythrodysesthesia) was administered. Total anthracycline dose was 415 mg/m2.
Five months from initialpresentation, and after approval by the institutional review board, the patientunderwent aggressive cytoreductive surgery including greater and lesseromentectomy, cholecystectomy and partial peritonectomy and removal of 402metastatic nodules.
At the end of the surgical procedure,cisplatin 100 mg/m2 at 40–42°C was continuously perfusedin the peritoneal cavity. CHPP (Figure 3) consisted of the placement of 7 temperatureprobes: (1) ligament of Treitz, (2) right lobe of the liver, (3) right upperquadrant, (4) left upper quadrant, (5) right lower quadrant, (6) left lowerquadrant, and (7) sigmoid colon mesentery. The abdomen was then closedtemporarily to secure the inflow and outflow cannulas. A Y-shaped inflow cannula was placed abovethe liver, and a pelvic drain was placed in the pelvis.
Plasmalyte was perfused for 15 to 20minutes to establish equivalent temperatures. When average temperatures of 40°Cwere established in all portions of the abdomen,cisplatin 100 mg/m2 was added to the perfusate simultaneous with thebeginning of an intravenous infusion of sodium disulfate. The abdomen was continuouslyagitated for 90 minutes, temperatures were monitored frequently, and agitationwas adjusted according to the temperature of each probe. The temperature of the inflow and the thermomistorwas 45°C. Temperature in the intra-abdominalprobes was about 41-42°C. The volume was 2.5 liters. Flow rate was 700 mL/minute throughout the 1.5hour CHPP procedure. Cisplatin was drained, and then two liters of Plasmalyte atroom temperature were infused to rinse cisplatin from the peritoneal cavity. Abdomenwas reopened and inspected. Gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes were placed inanticipation of enteral nutrition in the post-operatory period. The patient hada rapid recovery and was discharged from the hospital to home 7 days aftersurgery.
Pathology evaluation from peritoneal tumornodules reported minimal residual malignant small tumor cells in most of thespecimens consistent with microscopic residual disease.
Outpatient and home chemotherapy were provided before and duringradiation (6 months from diagnosis) and then for an additional 8 cycles until14 months after diagnosis. Regimen was similar to that reported by Wagner et al.[8]. Temozolamide (100 mg/m2/day × 5 days) and irinotecan (10 mg/m2/day × 5 days × 2 weeks) for2 four-week cycles. During total abdominal radiation (3 Gy × 10 fractions; total30 Gy and 15 Gy to the liver/kidneys) irinotecan was not given and only temozolomide(100 mg/m2/dose × 5 days × 2 cycles) was provided. After radiation, 8 cycles of temozolomide +irinotecan were given. Day 1: temozolomide and irinotecan were given in theoutpatient clinic each month. Days 2–5 and 8–12: irinotecan chemotherapyinfusions were done at home (after school) using home health nursing.
The patient tolerated thischemotherapy well and had one, brief hospitalization for fever and neutropenia.He was able to attend elementary school with almost perfect attendance.
Although the patient continued to behealthy, attend school, and had no symptoms, routine PET-CT done 2 months aftercompletion of therapy showed five FDG avid areas (Figure 4). All were just outsideof the peritoneum and at edge or outside prior radiation fields: two adjacentposterior perihepatic, one at the dome of the right diaphragm, and 2retroperitoneal pericaval nodes. IMRT(1.5 Gy in 15 fractions; total 45 Gy) was given to the retroperitoneal disease.Radiosensitization was with temozolomide (75 mg/m2/day × 5 days × 2weeks), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks × 3 doses), valproate (500 mg/m2/daydivided BID), and rapamycin (2 mg/m2/day). The patient tolerated radiotherapywell and had no side effects.
He was reimaged and the adjacent perihepaticlesions had increased in size from 3.0 × 1.5 cm to approximately 3.8 × 2.6 cm andfrom 3.3 × 1.3 cm to 4.3 × 2.2 cm; there was no change in size of the 1 cm domeof right diaphragm lesion. To destroy cells in the perihepatic nodules and increasechance of mounting an immune response, both radio frequency ablation andcryoablation were used (Figure 5). Underdirect CT fluoroscopic guidance, a radio frequency ablation (RFA) electrode(RITA system) was used to heat the tumor to 42-43°C for 30 minutes,then each lesion was frozen using a cryoablation probe (PERC-17; Endocare) for2 cycles of freezing (5–10 minutes) and thawing (5–8 minutes). The patient toleratedthe procedure well and was observed in the hospital overnight. He had no sideeffects from the procedure except for some skin reaction and scab whichresolved in 2 weeks.
The patient received a regimen ofvalproate (250 mg BID), rapamycin (2 mg daily), and sorafenib (200 mg BID) andchemotherapy similar to that reported by Casanova et al. [9], vinorelbine (25 mg/m2 IV monthly)and oral cyclophosphamide (25 mg daily) (see Figure 6). Sorafenib and vinorelbine werediscontinued because of significant diarrhea (see treatment schema in Figure 6). The patient attended school full timewithout symptoms.
For almost 2 years from diagnosis of massivedisease at DSRCT, this patient has had only 32 days of hospitalizationincluding initial admission of 18 days, 3 days for hydration, 1 episode forhematuria, 2 days for fever and neutropenia, 7 days for CHPP surgery, and 1overnight observation for RFA + cryoablation. He will continue on a maintenance chemotherapy regimen and be followedwith PET-CT fusion imaging every 3 months.
Once ascites improved after initialchemotherapy cycle, subsequent cycles were given in the outpatient clinic. For 13out of 14 cycles, only day 1 was given at the major medical center, days 2–4ifosfamide or 2–12 irinotecan were given at home using home infusion services.
Response to initial chemotherapy(Table 1) was evaluated with abdominal CT scans interpreted as a very good partial response (Figure 4), more than 50% reductionof the perihepatic, pelvic, and omental implants when compared with initial CT imagingstudies. After one cycle of chemotherapy, PET scan demonstrated diffuse nodulesand less ascites throughout the abdomen. PET-CT demonstrated low-grade FDGactivity (maximal SUV 3). After completion of 4 months of VIDE, PET scan continuedto demonstrate low-FDG uptake in the perihepatic implant with maximum SUVmeasured at 3 (stable disease). Othernodules did not show significant uptake probably because of small size (<1 cm). PET scan after cytoreductive surgery, CHPP, and one cycle of temozolamide/irinotecan showed residual activity over the dome of the right lobe of theliver maybe post treatment-related or post-surgical in nature. After completion of abdominal radiation and temozolomide with irinotecan(6 cycles), there was no evidence of FDG avid disease. This was considered aclinical complete remission.
Except for the initial chemotherapy, thetreatment regimen for this patient was in the outpatient or home setting,allowing him to have excellent quality of life. This allowed school attendance and play athome. Generally home ifosfamide bag changes or irinotecan infusions could bedone after  school.
Because the patient had a high riskof recurrence, based on the initial presentation with massive ascities and verylarge number of peritoneal implants, close monitoring for relapse was necessarywith PET-CT imaging fusion every 12weeks during and after therapy. This resulted in detection of recurrence beforeappearance of clinical symptoms. The PET-CT also provided information useful inIMRT treatment planning.
Chronic adjuvant chemotherapy: well tolerated.
The current therapy designed to treatan Ewing's family of tumor using agentscompatible with outpatient or home therapy that could be given for months toyears. Because of high-risk status, a long term therapy is planned. Thetoxicity has been with minimal with two episodes of fever and neutropenia or illnessassociated with chemotherapy administration to date.
In this report, we have shown a childwith high-risk DSRCT with massive disseminated peritoneal DSRCT implants who hadcomplete response and sustained a remission for  21 months following therapywith a carefully designed multimodality outpatient and home treatment plan.
DRSCT has a 15% overall survival at 5 years [10]. Patients presenting with abdominal disease typically are in an advancedstage, with large masses and/or extensive seeding in the visceral and parietalperitoneal layers. Thus, DSRCT in the abdomen is almost always disseminatedregionally. The presence of the translocation t(11 : 22) (p13 : q12) involving fusionof the Ewing sarcoma gene (EWS) and the Wilm's tumor gene (WT1) provides theconfirmation of diagnosis [1, 11].
Chemotherapy agents with knownactivity in DSRCT are very similar to those active in Ewing Sarcoma. Both tumorsshare an EWS fusion protein and may also share molecular mechanismsfacilitating proliferation and survival pathways. Alkalyting agents such as cyclophosphamideand ifosfamide are important components of therapy. Currently, a well-recognized treatment schemahas been reported by Kushner et al. [12] who described results in 12 DSRCT patients. This intensive alkylator-basedtherapy used cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine alternating withifosfamide and etoposide. Itscombination with other treatment modalities such as surgery, radiation, autologousstem cell rescue, or the combination of all of the above was used. The median survivaltime was 19 months. For those achieving complete response, the median followup inthis series was 22 months, about the same as our patient. The toxicity for thisregimen can be substantial and often includes hospitalization not only forchemotherapy, but also fevers associated with myelosupression and mucositis.Our outpatient and home program had significantly less hospitalization and verytolerable side effects. It permitted routine school attendance; play activitieswere possible with an excellent quality of life.
In our patient, ifosfamide/mesna as a continuous infusion aspreviously described by Skubitz et al. [13], was well tolerated and allowedtreatment in the outpatient setting. No hydration is required. Since a smallvolume (e.g., 240–360 mL/day) can be infused, this permits a normal pattern ofsleep. Irinotecan activity in sarcoma has been shown by Bisogno et al. [14] and Wagner et al. [8]. We also have observed high activityof the temozolomide + irinotecan combination in relapsed Ewing's sarcoma and 2previous patients with DSRCT [15]. Rossof and Bayliff described successful responses in DSRCT cases toirinotecan [16]. The toxicity of temozolomide andirinotecan was very low. Our patient did not experienced documented infections;home infusions of irinotecan were routine and done after school.
Epigenetic alterations of DSRCT areprobable since EWS is associated with responses to such agents. For example, the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in Ewing'sfamily tumors was recently described by Sakimura et al. [17]. This group showed expression ofthe EWS-Fli1 fusion RNA and fusion protein was inhibited with desipeptide. Recentpreliminary work shows that both HDAC and mTOR inhibitors are promising not only for EWS, butalso DSRCT [18–20]. Low dose of cyclophosphamide has activity in pediatric sarcoma [9]. We have used this information inthe design of a chronic, well-tolerated outpatient adjuvant therapy in our DSRCTpatient.
Immuno-histochemistry studies revealedin several intra-abdominal DSRCTspecimens, upregulation in tumor cells of platelet derived growth factor AB chain and platelet derivedgrowth factor alpha receptor [21]. Perhaps these findings support additional contributions towards tumorsurvival and/or apoptosis resistance. Thussorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that directly inhibits the autophosphorylation of severalreceptor tyrosine kinases including PDGFR beta, and c-kit may have additionalactivity beyond VEGF receptor inhibition [22].
Local control is important in DSRCT [10]. In our patient local control measuresincluded surgery with CHPP [5–7, 23], abdominal radiation with radiosensitizingchemotherapy during the first cycle (temozolamide) and with bevacizumab duringradiation for relapse [24]. The initial role of surgery in patients with extensive intra-abdominaldisease is often limited to biopsies; after chemotherapy response this is followedby a debulking procedure. Saab et al. [25]reported a series of patients withabdominopelvic DRSCT with incomplete resection, in which total surgicalresection was not feasible; outcome was poor.
Aggressive cytoreductive surgery iscurrently accepted to have a primary role in the achievement of prolonged survival of some malignancies involving the peritoneum [4, 6]. In DSRCT Lal reported 3-year OS was 58% in gross total resection incomparison with 0% in the nonresection cohort [10]. Other therapeutic modalities such as CHPP have been found to significantly improve outcome in cancerinvolving the peritoneum [6, 23, 26–28]. Although Gil et al. [29] showed no benefit in DSRCT and hadmore toxicity with intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin, no further multiagentchemotherapy was used in the postoperative period. Our patient was dischargedfrom the hospital on post-op day 7 and subsequently began cycles of adjuvanttemozolomide + irinotecan, a non-cross-resistant regimen.
The combination of CHPP andradiotherapy would be expected to result in scarring and adhesions and limitability to do second-look surgery. Thusthe local control option for isolated recurrent perihepatic lesions was radio frequencyablation and cryoablation (Figure 5). The use of this technique in pediatricpatients with metastatic DSRCT has been previously reported [30]. Heating increases the expression of heat shock proteins in hepatocellularcarcinoma; these molecular chaperones are important for antigen presentation [31]. Cryoablation is a technique to notonly kill tumor cells, but avoid protein denaturation by RFA. This approachusing heat (RFA probe), then cryoablation can be considered an “in vivovaccine” and was first developed by S Markovic at Mayo Clinic; a clinical trialis currently underway to study effectiveness in melanoma hepatic metastases.
We found that PET-CT imaging wasuseful for the evaluation of the extension of disease at presentation as wellas a useful tool for monitoring the response to therapy; therefore, we performed PET-CT scans in our patient at every 3 months interval. Theuse of PET for DSRCT has been described previously by Rosoff and Bayliff [16]. This is the first report of its usein children after the use of continuous peritoneal perfusion and to monitor forrecurrence. Reaching a no evidence ofdisease (NED) status and excellent quality of life was possible in our patientwith very extensive abdominopelvic DSRCT using outpatient therapy. Principles and techniques should be applicableto other high-risk young patients with DSRCT.
Finally, because inherent andseemingly inevitable chemotherapy resistance of DSRCT, in addition to effortsat best local control, novel therapeutic ideas are needed in the event of a relapse. The optionsinclude new agents such as small molecule inhibitor of C-kit and PDGFR,imatinib mesylate which has a remarkable safety profile. The current experienceof the use of imatinib in DSRCT has been recently reported by Bond et al.,where no objective response was seen at the dose and schedule tested [32]. Othermolecules include IGF-R1 antibodies that inhibit downstream signaling of boththe mTOR and MAP kinase pathways that are important in both proliferation andresistance to apoptosis of a variety of cancers. It is noteworthy that patientswith Ewing's family of tumors responded inphase I trial of R1507. The SARC consortium phase II trial of R1507 opened inearly 2008 (SARC 011; sarctrials.com) and should provide a determine whetherthis agent is active in DSRCT in ages 12 and up [33]. The safety profile of a multiple ascendingdose study for R1507 for children ages 2 to 17 with advanced solid tumors (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/)is expected to allow participation of younger cohorts (ages 2 and up) on SARC 011 in 2008.
