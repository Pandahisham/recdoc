DIAZOPHTHALOCYANINS AS REAGENTS FOR FINE STRUCTURAL CYTOCHEMISTRY

 This paper reports the synthesis of 14 diazophthalocyanins containing Mg, Cu, or Pb as the chelated metal. To assess the usefulness of these compounds for fine structural cytochemistry, the relative coupling rates with naphthols were tested as well as the solubility of the resulting azo dyes. Three of the diazotates were reacted with tissue proteins in aldehyde-fixed material, and the density increases thus produced were compared in the electron microscope with those produced by staining similarly fixed material with the phthalocyanin dye, Alcian Blue. Finally, one of the diazotates was used as a capture reagent for the demonstration of the sites of acid phosphatase activity with the electron microscope.
