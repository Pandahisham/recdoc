EFFECTS OF CHRONIC EXCESS SALT FEEDING 

 Among female rats and dogs which were fed excess salt for periods of about 1 and 4 years, respectively, elevations in plasma cholesterol concentrations were frequent and in some cases, quite marked. Rats on a similar regimen for only 2 and 6 months had less frequent and significantly lesser elevations of cholesterol. The lipid changes did not appear to be related primarily to increased blood pressure, kidney disease, differences in body weight or food consumption. There is no present evidence which suggests that this phenomenon is related to atherogenesis although it was speculated that this was possible.
