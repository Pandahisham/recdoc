A BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF ENCAPSULATUS PNEUMONIÆ (FRIEDLÄNDER'S BACILLUS)

 A biological classification has been made of thirty strains of Friedländer's bacillus. This study reveals that there exist among these strains three sharply defined and specific types and one heterogeneous group. The three types are Type A, fifteen strains; Type B, six strains; Type C, three strains; and Group X, six strains. The agglutination, agglutinin adsorption, protection, thread, and precipitin reactions have been employed in the working out of this classification, and the types have been proved highly specific by means of each serological test.
