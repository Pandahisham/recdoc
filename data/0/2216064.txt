Objectives: We performed a phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerance of a Lactobacillus vaginal suppository for prevention of recurrent UTI.Methods: Premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTI were randomized to use L. crispatus CTV-05 or placebo vaginal suppositories daily for five days.Results: 30 women were randomized (15 to L. crispatus CTV-05). No severe adverse events occurred. Mild to moderate vaginal discharge and genital irritation were reported by women in both study arms. Seven women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 developed pyuria without associated symptoms. Most women had high concentrations of vaginal H202-producing lactobacilli before randomization. L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri were the most common Lactobacillus species identified, with stable prevalence over time.Conclusions: L. crispatus CTV-05 can be given as a vaginal suppository with minimal sideeffects to healthy women with a history of recurrent UTI. Mild inflammation of the urinary tract was noted in some women.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs)affect millions of women each year, with an annual societal cost of billions ofdollars [1]. Importantly, more than one quarter of women with a UTI will have arecurrent infection within six months [2].There are few established options for prevention of UTI other than theuse of prophylactic antibiotics [3].However, resistance to commonly used antibiotics is increasing amongbacterial cystitis isolates [4].Therefore, effective nonantibiotic methods of prevention areneeded. One potential alternative may bea lactobacillus probiotic.
A growing body of evidence suggests that vaginal H202-producinglactobacilli may have a protective effect against urogenital infections,including UTI [5–11]. It is hypothesizedthat lactobacilli prevent uropathogen colonization of the vagina, a necessarystep in ascending infection of the bladder.Several clinical trials have demonstrated that certain Lactobacillus species, mainly L. rhamnosus and  L. fermentum, can be given orally or vaginally with resultingcolonization of the vagina, reduction in vaginal coliform counts, and evenreduction in UTI recurrence [12–18]. Specificstrains were chosen for their abilities to produce H202, adhere to uroepithelial cells, interfere with uropathogen attachment and growth, and persist in the vagina [18, 19].The most frequently existing vaginal Lactobacillus species, L.crispatus [20, 21], also produces H202 and possesses the adherence and inhibitory qualities essential for a good probioticcandidate [22, 23].
L. crispatus strain CTV-05 has beendeveloped as a vaginal suppository (LACTIN-V) for the prevention of recurrentUTI in women. L. crispatus CTV-05 ishighly adherent to vaginal epithelial cells [24], and when given as a suppositorycan colonize the vagina [25].Furthermore, L. crispatus CTV-05 has been reported to have a specific DNA fingerprint that distinguishesit from endogenous vaginal lactobacilli [25].To further evaluate the safety of this new formulation of L. crispatus CTV-05 and its effect onthe vaginal microbial flora, we conducted a phase I, randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled trial of vaginal L.crispatus CTV-05 in premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTI.
We recruited premenopausal women aged 18–35years with a history of three or more uncomplicated UTIs diagnosed in the pastyear, or two uncomplicatedUTIs diagnosed in the past six months, from (student health center, Universityof Washington, Wash, USA.) Additional eligibility requirementsincluded regular menstrual cycles or amenorrhea for at least six monthssecondary to use of a hormonal contraceptive, a normal Pap smear documented inthe last year or at the baseline clinic visit, abstinencefrom sexual activity or participation ina mutually monogamous sexual relationship, use of birth control, agreement notto use other intravaginal products, agreement not to have sexual intercourse oruse tampons between the baseline and first follow-up visit, and capability tounderstand English and provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria included history ofurologic abnormality, recent urologic surgery or urinary catheterization,history of complicated pyelonephritis or renal calculi, hysterectomy, recent sexuallytransmitted infection (STI) or bacterial vaginosis, risk factors for STI andHIV, history of recurrent genital herpes, menses anticipated within ten days, pregnancy,lactation, recent antibiotic or antifungal use, diabetes or other immunocompromised state, drugor alcohol abuse, use of the (NuvaRing), prior use of the study drug or allergyto any of its components, and abnormal initial pelvic examination. The study was approved by (InstitutionalReview Board (IRB), University of Washington, Wash,USA.)
Subjects were randomized in a double-blindedfashion to L. crispatus CTV-05 at adose of 5 × 108 colony forming units(cfu) or placebo vaginal suppository to be inserted daily for five days. L. crispatus CTV-05 and placebosuppositories were similar in appearance and consisted of a preservation matrixand maltodextran. Both were prepackagedby the manufacturer (Osel, Inc., Palo Alto,Calif, USA) according to a randomizationschedule and supplied to the study site sequentially labeled with a subjectnumber.
Subjectswere seen at three clinic visits over a period of one month. At the first (baseline) visit, eligible subjectsprovided informed consent before undergoing a structured medical andgynecologic history and physical examination.They provided urine, vaginal, and cervical specimens. Subjects inserted the first dose of studydrug in the clinic and were instructed to record any symptoms occurring duringthe first week of study on a prepared diary card. Subjects were seen in follow-up 6–8 days (1-week)visit and 26–34 days (4-week) visit after enrollment. During these visits, new symptoms, newurogenital infections, and any changes in clinical history were recorded. Follow-up visits were otherwise similar to thebaseline visit. Finally, subjects werecontacted by telephone six months after enrollment to assess symptoms,pregnancy, new diagnoses, or major medical events.
Laboratorytesting included urine dipstick testing, urinalysis, urine culture, vaginalfluid wet preparation slides, gram stains, and culture for facultative isolatesand Lactobacillus species at allvisits. Repetitive elementsequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) for L. crispatus CTV-05 was performed on three lactobacillus coloniesfrom culture at each visit [25]. Urinepregnancy testing was performed at the baseline and 4-week visits. Testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydiatrachomatis by DNA amplification was done at the baseline visit.
Asample size of 30 was chosen to evaluate the primary outcome of safety asassessed through self-reported symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratorystudies. Secondary outcomes includedshifts in the vaginal flora assessed by vaginal culture and vaginalcolonization with L. crispatus CTV-05assessed by rep-PCR. The Fisher exacttest was used to test statistical significance.
Thirty women were randomized (15 to L. crispatus CTV-05). All subjectstook the five planned doses of study drug.Two women randomized to L.crispatus CTV-05 completed treatment over six days, and one womanrandomized to placebo used six suppositories over six days. All women remained on study through the4-week visit (Figure 1).
Baselinecharacteristics of subjects were similar in the two treatment groups (Table 1). The majority of women were young, white,healthy, university students in their 20s.The median number of UTIs in the last year was three. Screening tests for pregnancy and STI werenegative for all subjects.
 There were no severe adverse events. Mild to moderate adverse events wererelatively common, however. Of thosefelt by the investigators to be related to study drug use, abnormal vaginaldischarge was the most frequently occurring, followed by external genitalirritation and vaginal candidiasis (Table 2). These adverse events occurred withsimilar or greater frequency in women randomized to placebo as compared to womenrandomized to L. crispatus CTV-05. Three women reporting vaginal candidiasis alsoreported multiple prior episodes in the preceding 12 months. Two women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 reported episodes of cystitis during thestudy.
All subjects completed a diary card of symptoms that occurred during the period ofstudy drug insertion. Recorded symptoms generallyconfirmed the reported adverse events and were similar to symptoms reported at the1-week clinic visit (below). Thesesymptoms occurred with similar frequency in each treatment arm.
Abnormalvaginal discharge was the symptom most frequently reported by subjects atclinic visits following study drug use (Figure 2). While no women reported abnormalvaginal discharge at baseline, six randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 and five randomized to placebo reported abnormalvaginal discharge at the 1-week visit. Abnormaldischarge was less frequently reported at the 4-week visit. External genital or vaginal irritation wasalso reported by six women in each treatment arm at follow-up visits. Vaginal odor was reported at the 1-week visitby one woman randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05,and at the 4-week visit by two women randomized to placebo. Dysuria was reported by one woman randomizedto L. crispatus CTV-05 at the 1-week visitand by one woman randomized to placebo at the 1- and 4-week visits. Headache, abdominal or pelvic cramps/abdominalpain, and low back pain were frequently reported at baseline as well as atfollow-up visits. There were nosignificant differences in reported symptoms at any visit between women in thetwo treatment arms.
Physicalexam findings were benign in both treatment arms. External genital erythema was found at the 1-and 4-week visits in more women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 than in women randomized to placebo (4 versus 1, P=.33). Moderate-to-profuse vaginaldischarge was frequently found in women from both treatment arms duringfollow-up examinations(12 versus 8, P = 1.00), though this finding was also often apparent at thebaseline visit (6 women in each arm).One woman randomized to placebo had vaginal erythema noted at 1 week. No cervical, urethral, uterine, or adnexalabnormalities were noted.
Seven(47%) women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 had nine episodes of pyuria with a urine white blood cell count ≥8 per mm3 [26] (range 8–203) during a follow-up clinic visit (Table 3). None of these womenhad pyuria at baseline. In contrast, noneof the women randomized to placebo had pyuria at 1 or 4 weeks (P = .01). Pyuria was positively correlated with urineleukocyte-esterase test results (Spearman r = 0.57, P<.01). Therewere no significant associations with vaginal or urinary symptoms or examfindings. Microbes isolated from theurine of women in the L. crispatus CTV-05 arm with pyuria includedmixed gram-positive organisms (6), lactobacillus (3), E. coli (1), enterococcus (1), group B streptococcus (1), and yeast(1). One subject had a negative urineculture, and none had symptomatic infection.Lactobacillus and mixed gram-positive rods were isolated at 103-104 cfu/ml from more women with pyuria (50% and 75%) than without (19% and 46%,resp.) at the 1-week visit (P=.22 for lactobacillus, P=.60 formixed gram-positive rods) but not at the 4-week visit. None of the other isolated organisms was foundat a significantly increased frequency in women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 versus placebo orin women with pyuria compared to those without pyuria at any visit. Two women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 and one randomized to placebo had hematuria atthe 4-week visit (≥30 red blood cells per mm3).
Nine women in the L. crispatus CTV-05 arm and ten in theplacebo arm completed the six-month follow-up telephone call. None reported pregnancy, and no major healthproblems occurred. Four women in the L. crispatus CTV-05 arm and one in theplacebo arm reported one or more episodes of cystitis.
28 of 30 women had vaginalcolonization with H202-producinglactobacilli at baseline and all follow-up visits (Table 4). Two womenrandomized to placebo had no vaginal H202-producinglactobacilli detected at any clinic visit.One of these women had large quantities of Gardnerella and Bacteroides species morphotypes on gram stain. Culturesfrom women with H202-producinglactobacilli yielded heavy (4+) growth.
Vaginalcultures from five women in each treatment arm yielded E. coli from one or more clinic visits. E. coli was isolated from vaginal cultures taken at the 1- and 4-week visits from 4women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 and from one women randomized to placebo (P=.33). No inverse association between vaginalcolonization with H202-producinglactobacilli and vaginal colonization with E.coli was detected. Vaginal culturesfrequently yielded Candida at baselineas well as follow-up visits.
Using rep-PCR, L. crispatus CTV-05 was detected in the vaginas of four womenrandomized to L. crispatus CTV-05(three women at each clinic visit). Threewomen had a positive assay for L.crispatus CTV-05 detected at the baseline visit before administration of thestudy drug. No women randomized toplacebo had a positive assay at any visit (P = .22 each visit).
Wecompared our rep-PCR results (Figure 3)to previously published rep-PCR patterns [25] in order to identify thebacterial species. At baseline, 80% ofsubjects had L. crispatus, 37% had L. jensenii, 17% had L. gasseri, and 27% had other Lactobacillus species detected invaginal culture. The followingcombinations of Lactobacillus specieswere found: L. crispatus (27%), L. crispatus and L. jensenii (20%), L.crispatus and L. gasseri (7%), L. crispatus and other Lactobacillus species (13%), L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri (3%), L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and other Lactobacillus species (7%), L. crispatus, L. gasseri, and other Lactobacillus species (3%), L. jensenii (7%), L. gasseri (3%), other Lactobacillus species (3%), and no Lactobacillus (7%). The prevalences of individual species wererelatively stable over time (Figure 4). There were no significant differences in Lactobacillus species prevalence betweensubjects in the two treatment arms with the exception of L. gasseri at the 1-week visit (P = .02).
In phase I, placebo-controlled trial, use of a L. crispatus CTV-05 vaginal suppository, for the prevention of recurrent UTI was well tolerated with minimal side effects. There were no serious adverse events, anddespite the occurrence of abnormal vaginal discharge and external genital orvaginal irritation in several women, compliance was high. These mild to moderate symptoms appear to besecondary to the act of suppository use or a reaction to the preservationmatrix rather than a consequence of L.crispatus CTV-05 as they occurred with similar frequency among women ineach treatment arm. Several women alsoreported vaginal candidiasis. However,given the frequency of recurrent vaginal candidiasis experienced by subjectsprior to enrollment and the prevalence of Candida in baseline vaginal cultures, the relationship of this condition to study druguse is not compelling.
 L. crispatus CTV-05 use was associatedwith pyuria (detected by microscopy and urine leukocyte-esterase) in seven womenat either the 1- or 4-week visits (P = .04 at 4 weeks). Pyuria was not associated with urogenitalsymptoms, exam findings, or symptomatic UTI.While lactobacillus was not isolated from the urine during every episodeof pyuria, it is possible that some lactobacilli were misclassified as mixed gram-positiverods, as both were more frequently found in women with pyuria than in womenwithout. Our data suggest that vaginalinstillation of L. crispatus CTV-05 inducesa mild inflammatory response in the bladder or vaginal mucosa of some subjectswithout causing prolonged urogenital infection.The importance of this phenomenon with respect to safety or potential efficacyis unclear. It is possible that induction of an asymptomatic inflammatoryresponse by lactobacilli protects against uropathogen colonization of thevagina or infection in the bladder [27].
Limitedexisting data from prior studies suggest that L. crispatus therapy is safe.Women surveyed after participation in a clinical trial of a vaginalcapsule formulation of L. crispatus CTV-05for treatment of bacterial vaginosis rarely reported adverse effects, and thosereported were largely related to a perceived difference in vaginaldischarge. Satisfaction with the vaginalcapsule was high [28]. No adverse effects were reported in a pilot study of L. crispatus CTV-05 givenintravaginally to a small group of healthy women [25]. Nine women with a history of recurrent UTIreported no adverse effects when given L.crispatus strain GA198332 as a vaginal suppository every other day for oneyear [29]. Studies of other probioticstrains of Lactobacillus haveindicated that they can be given to women safely with minimal or no sideeffects [12–18]. To our knowledge, pyuriaresulting from vaginal instillation of Lactobacillus has not been previously reported, and should be evaluated further in futurestudies.
Wedid not see an effect of L. crispatus CTV-05 use on vaginal Lactobacillus growth. However, most study participants had heavyvaginal growth of H2O2-producinglactobacilli at baseline, making detection of subsequent changes difficult. Data from a pilot study indicated that L. crispatus CTV-05 did not displace otherendogenous vaginal lactobacilli. Vaginalcolonization was most successful in women lacking vaginal H2O2-producinglactobacilli at the outset, suggesting that a lactobacillus probiotic may bemost effective at establishing vaginal colonization in women with abnormalflora, such as those with bacterial vaginosis or recurrent UTI [25].
To our knowledge, our study represents the first attempt to use rep-PCR to identify the genetic fingerprint of the probiotic strain L. crispatus CTV-05 in a larger-scale clinical study. Although none of the placebo recipients werecolonized with lactobacillus strains having the characteristic rep-PCR pattern of L. crispatus CTV-05 at any time, threewomen randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05 had at least one isolate in their vaginal culture at baseline that borethe characteristic fingerprint. Therefore,colonization of the vagina following suppository administration was difficult to demonstrate. As there are nolarge-scale surveys of the prevalence and distribution of lactobacilli bearing this fingerprint, we do not know whether the rep-PCR technique failed todistinguish L. crispatus CTV-05 fromother genetically closely related strains of L. crispatus naturally colonizing the vagina at baseline, orwhether the identical strain was prevalent in our study population. Of note, subjects in our study had a muchhigher prevalence of vaginal H2O2-producinglactobacilli in baseline vaginal cultures than found in previous studies [25]. By comparing our rep-PCR results to previouspublished rep-PCR patterns [25], we characterized lactobacillus isolates at thespecies level and found L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri to be the most prevalent species, with relatively stableprevalences over time. Our prevalencedata are consistent with what has been previously documented [20, 21]. Additional tests are under way to comparequantitative PCR results for L. crispatus in women before and after the introduction of active suppositories or placebo.
Our study was notdesigned nor statistically powered to evaluate the effect of L. crispatus CTV-05 on the rate of UTIrecurrence. Therefore, it is difficultto interpret the report of cystitis in two women randomized to L. crispatus CTV-05. Other small studies have suggested that use ofvaginally administered L. crispatus maybe associated with a lower rate of UTI recurrence [16, 29].
The major strengthsof our study include the placebo-controlled, randomized study design, excellentcompliance, and extensive and complete followup. Use of a study diary provided finer detailsof our subjects’ experiences that confirmed adverse events and symptomsreported from memory at clinic visits. Weaknessesthat should be mentioned include the inability to accurately document vaginalcolonization with the probiotic strain, and the inherent lack of statisticalpower due to the small sample size typical of phase I studies. We are currently conducting a phase II trialthat will have more power to clarify some of the issues raised in thisstudy.
Inconclusion, L. crispatus CTV-05 iswell tolerated when given as a vaginal suppository to healthy women with ahistory of recurrent UTI. Mild tomoderate side effects related to suppository use occur but do not affectcompliance. L. crispatus CTV-05 maycause mild asymptomatic inflammation of the lower urinary tract. Timing of administration and efficacy inpreventing recurrent cystitis should be evaluated further in larger studies.
