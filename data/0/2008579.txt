The Use of Progestogen in the Treatment of Metastatic Carcinoma of the Kidney and Uterine Body

The effect of the progestogen medroxyprogesterone acetate on metastases from renal, endometrial and other tumours has been studied in 25 patients. Seven patients with renal and endometrial tumours had a useful response, pulmonary metastases and a large primary renal tumour showing the greatest effect. Bony metastases were unaffected by the drug and were treated by local radiotherapy. If a response occurred, it did so within 3 months.
