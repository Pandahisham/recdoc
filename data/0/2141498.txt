COAGULATION OF MYOSIN BY DEHYDRATION

 When myosin is dehydrated it becomes insoluble. The number of detectable SH groups in myosin coagulated by dehydration is the same as in native soluble myosin. In this respect coagulation by dehydration differs from coagulation brought about in any of the other ways now known, but resembles the coagulation that occurs in muscle during rigor and in the egg after fertilization.
