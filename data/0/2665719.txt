Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The abnormalities in nutrient metabolism and elevated inflammatory mediators resulting from DM lead to impairment of wound healing and vulnerability to infection and foot ulcers. Diabetic lower limb ischemia often leads to limb necrosis. Lower extremity bypass surgery (LEBS) is indicated to prevent limb loss in patients with critical leg ischemia. This study investigated the alteration of inflammatory and endothelium dysfunction markers before and after LEBS in DM patients. Twenty one type 2 DM patients with LEBS were included. Blood was drawn before and at 1 day and 7 days after surgery in the patients. Plasma soluble cellular adhesion molecule levels and blood leukocyte integrin expressions were measured. Also, plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 and nitric oxide were analyzed to evaluate the vascular endothelial function. The results showed that there were no significant differences in plasma cellular adhesion molecules, endothelin-1 and nitric oxide levels, nor did any differences in leukocyte integrin expressions before and after the operation. These results suggest that the efficacy of LEBS on alleviating inflammatory reaction and improving endothelial function in DM patients was not obvious.

Diabetes  mellitus (DM) was  the 4th leading cause of death in Taiwan in 2007. Many diabetic patients have an increased risk of atherosclerosis,cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular diseases [1]. The abnormalities in nutrient metabolism and elevated inflammatorymediators resulting from DM lead to impairment of wound healing and vulnerabilityto infection and foot ulcers. Diabeticlower limb ischemia caused by arterial occlusion is the most common foot injuryleads to lower extremity amputation in DM patients [2]. Lower extremity bypass surgery (LEBS) is indicated to prevent limb loss in patientswith critical leg ischemia. Previous studiesrevealed that a large reduction in major amputation rates is associated withthe increase of LEBS [3, 4]. However, the efficacy of LEBS on inflammatoryreaction in DM patients has not been evaluated andthe changes in inflammatory mediators before and after the LEBS remain unknown.
Endothelialdysfunction accompanied by upregulated inflammatory mediators is a majorcontributing factor to the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications [5].  The injured vasculature endotheliumpromotes the expressions of cellular adhesion molecules. Overexpressions of cellular adhesion moleculefacilitate leukocyte-endothelial interactions which may aggravate inflammatoryreaction and tissue damage [6]. Previousstudy demonstrated that increased levels of plasma soluble adhesion moleculeoccur in type 2 patients [7]. Endothelin-1(ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor withmitogenic property. ET-1 stimulatesvascular smooth muscle cells proliferation, a major step in the development ofatherosclerosis [8]. Nitric oxide (NO) is avasodilator produced by endothelial cells. Other key roles of NO include inhibiting platelet aggregation, smoothingmuscle cells proliferation, reducing monocyte adherence, and so forth [9]. Previous study showed that at the onset ofdiabetes, the release or response to NO is reduced [10]. Both ET-1 and NO are important mediators inmaintaining vascular functions. Since LEBSincreases blood flow to tissues that may carryoxygen and nutrientsto the lower extremities and improvethe healing of the tissues [11], we hypothesized that the inflammatory process and vascular dysfunctionare attenuated in DM patients undergoing LEBS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether reperfusionof the lower extremities may improve the inflammation and endothelialdysfunction in DM patients.
This study was conducted from Aprilto December 2006 at Taipei Medical University-affiliated Wan FangHospital. Twenty one type 2 DM patients withsevere diabetic lower limb ischemia and underwent LEBS were enrolled in theexperimental group. The diabetesduration was 6–30 years, with a mean of 18.2 years. Insulin and combined therapy if necessary were used to control bloodglucose to within a range of 106–259 mg/dL. No leg infection was observed in LEBS patients, possibly because theoperation was successful and the antibiotics used after the surgery. The protocol was approved by the hospital ethicscommittee, and all the patients gave their informed written consent prior totheir participation in this study.
Bloodsamples were taken from each patient before and at 1 day and 7 days after the LEBS inDM patients. Ten milliliters of bloodwere drawn after 12 hours of fasting, placed in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Fresh blood 	 samples were collected for the analysis of leukocyte CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 expressions. Plasma samples obtained from whole bloodcentrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes were stored at  −80°C until further analysis.
Totalcholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoproteincholesterol, triglyceride, and creatinine were analyzed by an autoanalyser (Hitachi 7170, Tokyo, Japan). Blood HbA1C was measured using a commercialkit (Helena BioSciences, sunderland, UK). Procedures followed the manufacturerinstructions.
Concentrations of plasma ET-1, solubleintracellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1,soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1,and C-reactive protein (CRP) weremeasured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Concentrations of NO2−/NO3− were determined with a commercial kit (R&D systems). Procedures followed the manufacturerinstructions. The minimum detectabledose of ET-1, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and CRP were 0.064 pg/mL, 0.35 ng/mL, 0.6 ng/mL,1 ug/ml, respectively, for NO2−/NO3− was0.25 uM.
One hundred microliters of fresh blood was incubated with10 uL fluorescent isothiocynate (FITC)-conjugatedmouse monoclonal antihuman CD11a and phycoerthrin (PE)-conjugated mousemonoclonal antihuman CD18 (Serotec, Oxford, UK) for 15 minutes at 4°C. The proportions of CD11a/CD18 expressed on lymphocytes were analyzed byflow cytometry (Coulter, Miami, FL). The results arepresented as a percentage of CD11a-presentingcells in 1 × 105 lymphocytes. Tomeasure CD11b/CD18 expressions on polymorphoneuclear neutrophils (PMNs), FITC-conjugatedmouse monoclonal antihuman CD11b and PE-conjugated mouse monoclonal antihumanCD18 (Serotec) were added into 100 μL of freshblood. The results arepresented as a percentage of CD11b/CD18 expression in 1 × 105 PMNs. Lymphocytes and PMNs weregated on the basis of the forward scatter and side scatter profiles and wereanalyzed for the expressions of CD11a/CD18and CD11b/CD18, respectively.
Data arepresented as mean ± SD. All statistical analyses were performed usingSAS software package. The differences amongdifferent time points were determined by one-way analysis of variance. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Thecharacteristics of the subjects were presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences inplasma ET-1 and NO levels (Table 2), nordid any differences in plasma sVCAM, sICAM, and CRP levels before and after the operation(Table 3). Also, leukocyte CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 expressions before and afterthe operation did not differ in DM patients (Table 4).
This studyevaluated an LEBS-induced change in inflammatory response and endothelialfunction. We found that compared with thepreoperative condition, the mediators related to inflammation and vascularfunction did not change in type 2 DM patients at early and late stages afterLEBS.
Diabetic patients often have endothelial dysfunction andreleasing of endothelins is partly responsible for this. Previous report found that plasma ET-1 levelsare enhanced in patients with poor glycemic control [12] and ET-1 levels wereeven higher in DM patients complicated with vascular diseases [13]. A study performed by Schneideret al. [14] found that diabetic patients taking angiotensin converting enzymeinhibitors had lower plasma ET-1 levels than patients without, indicating thatmedical intervention did improve ET-1 levels. In addition to ET-1, NO is also an important regulatory determinant ofvascular tissue homeostasis. NO plays aprotective role by suppressing abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth musclefollowing various vascular interventions such as bypass grafting [15]. In this study, we did not observe differencesin plasma ET-1 and NO levels before and 1 or 7 days after surgery. This result may indicate that LEBS performedin this study did not, at least in the short run, improve endothelial functionin DM patients.
CRP is an inflammatorymarker. CRP levels were correlated withperipheral artery disease severity in patients undergoing LEBS [16]. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are adhesion proteinssynthesized by endothelial cells. Theirexpressions greatly increase after stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines [17]. Previous study showed that tissue ICAM-1levels were positively correlated with blood glucose levels [18]. Adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelialcells are involved in inflammatory or immunologic response mechanisms. Adhesion molecules on endothelial cells arethe ligands of integrins on leukocytes. CD11aand CD11b/CD18 are members of the leukocyte adhesion molecules β2 integrin. CD11a/CD18 are exclusivelyexpressed on leukocytes and CD11b/CD18 are abundant in PMNs [19]. In thisstudy, we analyzed lymphocyte CD11a/CD18 because the function of T-lymphocytesubsets is important on influencing the type of immunity and the inflammatoryresponse to infection [20]. CD11b/CD18expressed by neutrophil is important in mediating neutrophil-endothelial cellinteractions and binding to adhesion molecule on the surface of vascularendothelial cells [21, 22]. Previous reports revealed thatneutrophil CD11b/CD18 increases in infected patients and is correlated withmicrovascular dysfunction [23]. In this study, we did not observethe difference in leukocyte CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18 expressions before andafter the operation. This result wasconsistent with plasma sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, and CRP levels that these inflammatoryproteins did not change after LEBS. Thesefindings indicate that compared with preoperative state, LEBS did not attenuateinflammatory reaction in DM patients. Surgery and trauma inducea generalized state of inflammation. Although LEBS increases blood flow to theperipheral tissues, surgical injury stimulates the production of endogenousinflammatory mediators. Besides,reperfusion of the ischemic tissues may also result in exaggerated inflammatoryresponse [24, 25], this may make the alteration of inflammatory mediators not so obviousbefore and after the surgery.
In conclusion, this is a pilot studyto demonstrate that compared with the preoperative condition, nodifferences in plasma concentrations of ET-1, NO, and inflammatory mediators wereobserved in DM patients after LEBS. Thisresult suggests that the effect of LEBS on alleviating the inflammatoryreaction and improving endothelial function in DM patients was not obvious.
