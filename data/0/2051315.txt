Editorial Note

Australasian Chirpractic & Osteopathy has re-ordered its Volume and Issue numbers.  It has skipped from Volume 11, Issue number 2, July 2003, to Volume 12, Issue 1, July 2004.  This re-ordering was necessary after an unusual and unexpected set of editorial delays.  ACO apologises for this change but advises subscribers that there will be no loss in the number of issues they receive.
