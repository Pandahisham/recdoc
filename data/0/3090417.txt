Recombinant antibody phage display technology has been used to mimic many aspects                    of the processes that govern the generation and selection of high-affinity                    natural human antibodies in the human immune system, especially for infectious                    disease prophylaxis. An anti-rabies virus immunized phage-display Fab library                    was constructed from peripheral blood lymphocytes from vaccinated volunteers.                    The immunized antibody library, with a diversity of 6.7×108,                    was used to select and produce antibodies that bound to rabies virus                    glycoprotein. After five rounds of immobilized fixed rabies virion panning, four                    unique DNA sequences were found in the higher binding clones, and only one,                    Fab094, showed neutralization activity. Fab094 components were analyzed by                    ELISA, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. ELISA and                    immunofluorescence showed that Fab094 bound specifically to rabies virions.                    Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry showed that Fab094 reacted with rabies                    virus glycoprotein. To improve the penetration power of Fab094 antibodies, we                    developed Fab094 calcium phosphate nanoparticles (Fab094-CPNPs) and tested their                    efficacy. The rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test indicated that the                    neutralizing antibody titers of Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs were reached at 200.17                    IU/Kg and 246.12 IU/Kg, respectively. These findings were confirmed in vivo in a                    Kunming mouse challenge model. Our results demonstrate that human Fab094 and                    Fab094-CPNPs are efficacious candidate drugs to replace rabies immunoglobulin in                    post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

Rabies is a zoonotic viral disease that infects wild as well as domestic animals                    [1]. It is                estimated that at least 500,000 people receive post-exposure vaccination and that                55,000 people die from rabies each year [2], especially in Africa and Asia                where rabies is endemic, and where successful canine rabies vaccination or control                programs have not been implemented [3]. According to the categorization of exposure defined by                the World Health Organization (WHO), the most severe cases (category III) require                wound cleaning, rabies vaccination, and direct wound infiltration with rabies                immunoglobulin (RIG). Both purified equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) and human                immunoglobulin (HRIG) are used in rabies endemic areas [3], [4]. ERIG that is manufactured                presently is highly purified and the occurrence of adverse events has been reduced                significantly, but serious reactions, including anaphylaxis and serum sickness                caused by heteroantigens, can occur in spite of a negative skin test [5]. HRIG is purified                from carefully selected donors, and processing eliminates viral contaminants, but it                still can increase susceptibility to various infections, including HIV and hepatitis                viruses.
Alternatives to HRIG and ERIG should be considered, including human monoclonal                antibodies, human recombinant antibodies [6], and antibodies from other                animals, such as sheep [7]. Ray et al. have described two rabies-virus-neutralizing                scFv–Fc fusion proteins isolated from a human synthetic scFv phage display                library [8]. Ando et                al. have reported two Fab preparations, EP5G3 and GD2D12, that were isolated from a                phage display library, which have neutralizing activity against rabies virus strain                CVS when assayed by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) [1]. Houimel et al.                also have reported three Fabs isolated from a recombinant immune antibody library                    [2]. However,                the neutralizing activity of these Fab antibodies has not been confirmed in                    vivo.
In recent years, new strategies for cancer treatment based on drug-loaded                nanoparticulate formulations have emerged [9]. Nanoparticles are promising                drug carriers that show high drug-loading efficiency, minor drug leakage, and good                storage stability, and they can circumvent multidrug resistance of cancer cells                    [10]. Above all,                nanoparticles have an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [11]. Moreover, their                body biodistribution and permeability in tissues can be controlled by size and                surface properties [12].
The current study describes the isolation of human Fabs with                rabies-virus-neutralizing activity from a human immunized phage display library                using peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition, we developed Fab094-calcium                phosphate nanoparticles (CPNPs) and tested their efficacy in vitro                neutralization assay and animal model in vivo.
Rabies virus strain CTN (which has 83.2–96.8% nucleic acid and                    90.0–97.4% amino acid sequence homology to street strains [13]), was                    provided by Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Rabies                    virus strain CVS-11 and BHK-21 cells were from the Veterinary Institute of the                    Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China. BHK-21 cells were cultured in DMEM                    (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA).                    Cell lines were maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2.
Kunming mice (10–12 g) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of                    the Academy of Military Medical Sciences of China. All animal breeding and                    experiments were approved by the Veterinary Institute of the Academy of Military                    Medical Sciences animal Ethics Committee [Project Numbers SYXK (ARMY) 2009-                    045].
Lymphocytes were collected from 45 healthy donors who were immunized with rabies                    vaccine (Flury LEP; Chiron Behring Vaccines Pvt. Ltd). The volunteers got their                    signed, informed consent to participate, and the Ethics Committee of Nanjing                    Medical University approved the study.
Up to 10 ml anticoagulant blood was diluted with 10 ml PBS. Human peripheral                    blood mononuclear cells were isolated on a Ficoll-Pacque gradient and total RNA                    was prepared by using an RNA Purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA).                    First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by using a First-strand cDNA                    Synthesis kit (Invitrogen, USA) with Oligo-dT18.
For the amplification of Fab gene segments, a unique three-step PCR was used                        [14]. The                    V regions of heavy and light chains, CH1 (with IgG1 isotype) and                        CL (including κ and λ) were amplified first. In a second                    step, the amplified VH, VL, CH1 and                        CL were joined together in an overlap PCR to amplify the Fd and                    light chains. The Fd and L chains were mixed in equal ratios to generate                    full-length Fab fragments. The light- and heavy-chain Fds were spliced by PCR                    overlap extension with primers appended with SfiI restriction                    sites, as described above. The resultant Fab was digested with                        SfiI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany),                    purified on agarose gel, and ligated into the phagemid pComb3XSS (provided by                    the Barbas III Laboratory) that had been cut with the same restriction                    enzyme.
After ligation, DNA (2 µg) was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 15                    µl of water, and electro-transformed into 300 µl Escherichia                        coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). After                    transformation, 5 ml SOC medium was added at room temperature, and the cultures                    were shaken at 300 rpm for 1 h at 37°C. After addition of 10 ml pre-warmed                    (37°C) SB medium that contained 20 µg/ml ampicillin and 10 µg/ml                    tetracycline, the cultures were shaken at 300 rpm for an additional l h. These                    cultures were added to 180 ml pre-warmed SB medium that contained 50 µg/ml                    ampicillin and 10 µg/ml tetracycline, after which, 2 ml helper phage                    VCSM13 (1012–1013 PFU/ml) (Stratagene) was added,                    and the cultures were shaken for an additional 1.5 h. Kanamycin (70 µg/ml)                    was added, and the cultures were shaken at 37°C overnight.
The cultures were spun down and phages were precipitated by addition of 4%                    (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and 3% (w/v) NaCl, followed by incubation                    on ice for 30 min, and centrifugation at 37°C. Phage pellets were                    resuspended in 2 ml TBS with 1% BSA and microcentrifuged at room                    temperature for 5 min to pellet debris. The supernatant was sterilized by                    passing it through a 0.22-µm filter and stored at −20°C. This                    phage display antibody library was used for the following antigen panning.
The library was subjected to five rounds of panning, as previously described                        [14].                    Before being selected with rabies virus, the phages were incubated with                        1×106 human cells for non-specific binding, and then                    panning with rabies virus protein. The phage library was incubated with                    3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature and transferred onto microplates                    (Corning, NY, USA) coated with immobilized inactivated whole viruses of rabies                    virus CTN strain, at 0.5 µg/well, for 1 h at 37°C. Unbound phages were                    washed off with PBS/0.2% Tween-20 for 10–20 times. Antigen-bound                    phages were eluted using 0.5 ml trypsin/EDTA. The eluted phages were used to                    infect 2 ml fresh (OD600 = 0.8) E.                        coli XL1-Blue cells for 15 min at room temperature, and 10 ml                    prewarmed SB medium that contained 20 µg/ml ampicillin and 10 µg/ml                    tetracycline was added. The cultures were then shaken for 1 h at 37°C.                    Further growth, phage preparation, and panning were repeated as outlined above.                    After five rounds of immobilized antigen selection, random monoclonal phages                    were selected and screened by phage ELISA.
Specificity of individual phage Fab and soluble Fab were assessed by ELISA [15]. EIA/RIA                    Stripwell (Corning, NY, USA) 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4°C                    with fixed rabies virus protein of CTN strain (5 µg/ml), blocked with                    1% BSA blocking buffer, and incubated. The eluted phages from the fifth                    round of panning were used to infect E. coli XL1-Blue cells and                    spread on LB plates with 50 µg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37°C                    overnight. Single clones were selected randomly to produce phage as described                    previously. Fifty microliters of single phage preparation was added and                    incubated at room temperature for 1 h. As the negative control, empty phage was                    used. After washing twice with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), for                    phage ELISA, 50 µl horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13                    monoclonal antibody (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in milk blocking buffer                    (1∶2,000 dilution) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was                    visualized with TMB and H2O2 substrate, and stopped by 2 M                        H2SO4. Plates were read for OD450 with a                    reference wavelength of 630 nm, on a multiscan spectrum (Thermo Labsystems,                    USA).
High-titer clones were selected and cultured overnight, and the plasmids were                    extracted and sequenced. The DNA sequence of each Fab clone was analyzed with                    DNAclub and V-BASE2 software online.
The gene for pComb3XSS-Fab, which was confirmed as the correct sequence by DNA                    sequencing, was transformed into E. coli Top10F'                    (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for expression [16]. Cultures of recombinant                    bacteria were induced with 1 mM IPTG (Biosharp) and cultured with shaking at                    25°C for 12 h. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C and                    the cell pellet was suspended in 200 ml PBS. After sonication, the supernatant                    was collected by centrifugation for 30 min (12,000 rpm) at 4°C, and analyzed                    for soluble expression of Fab.
The Fab fragment was purified from the supernatant and medium by affinity                    chromatography with an ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein L column (Pierce) using an                    FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Fab was eluted with                    glycine buffer (pH 2.8). The eluted fractions were concentrated by centrifugal                    filters (10,000 MWCO; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The prepared Fab fragment                    which has neutralization activity (see below) was named as Fab094.
Protein samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE under                    reducing conditions, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The                    membranes were first blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat milk and then                    with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (Fab-specific), and finally developed using                    the ECL detection system and exposed to X-ray film.
Rabies virus strain CTN proteins were mixed with 20 µg purified Fab094 and                    50 µl protein-L Sepharose beads (Invitrogen), and incubated at 4°C                    overnight with gentle shaking. The immune complexes were detected by 12%                    SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose                    membranes. The commercial mouse anti-rabies virus glycoprotein antibody C86307M,                    which reacts with a glycoprotein of rabies, more than 20 different strains from                    4 serogroups, including CVS, Lagosbat, Mokola, Duwenhage were positive in                    neutralization (Meridian Life Science, USA), was added to the membranes for 1 h                    at room temperature. The HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added for                    another 1 h. Following further washes, bound antibodies were detected by the                    addition of the mixture of H2O2 and DAB, and after                    incubation for 15 min at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by washing with                    water.
The bands that corresponded to CTN virus protein on the polyacrylamide gel were                    analyzed by MS. Each gel slice was dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid                    (TFA), desalted, and concentrated using ZipTips from Millipore. Peptide solution                    (0.5 µl) was mixed with 0.5 µl matrix (5 mg/ml                    α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 30% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA),                    spotted on a target disk, and allowed to air dry. Samples were analyzed by MS                    (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany). Protein database searching was performed                    with the MASCOT search engine (http://www.matrixscience.com; Matrix Science, UK).
Binding of Fab094 with rabies-virus-infected cells was determined by IFA.                    Sub-confluent BHK-21 cells, which were grown in six-well chambers, were infected                    with rabies virus strain CVS-11 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. After                    incubation for 24 h, the chambers were washed twice with PBS/Tween 20. Diluted                    Fab094 was added to virus-infected BHK-21 cells. After incubation at room                    temperature for 2 h, followed by three washes in 0.5% PBS/Tween 20,                    FITC-labeled anti-human IgG (Fab-specific) was added at dilution of 1∶100,                    and the cells were observed under fluorescence microscopy. The uninfected cells                    were used as a negative control. The experiments that involved the use of rabies                    strain CVS-11 were performed in a BSL-3 laboratory.
Fab094-CPNPs were prepared using the adsorption technique [4]. Nanoparticles were prepared                    by a simple interfacial deposition method (nanoprecipitation). Briefly, 160 mg                        CaCl2, 160 mg NaH2PO4 and 160 mg sodium                    citrate were added to 180 ml distilled water under magnetic stirring at room                    temperature for 48 h, sonicated for 1 h, centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 15 min,                    4°C), and the precipitate was separated. After centrifugation, the                    precipitate was resuspended in PBS, and sonicated for 1 h. Then, 10 mg Fab094                    was added and stirred with the above suspensions to absorb the Fab094 at 4°C                    for 24 h. The resultant suspension was centrifuged and the precipitate was                    resuspended in pure water. The protein concentration of the supernatant was                    determined. Sizes of nanoparticles and Fab094-CPNPs were measured by                    Zetasizer-Nano instrument (Malvern, UK).
The sample was diluted three fold with DMEM that contained 10% FBS, and                    placed in a well. The samples were set up in duplicate. CVS-11 (100                        TCID50) was added to each well and incubated in a 5%                        CO2 incubator at 37°C for 90 min. BSR cells were added to                    each well and incubated for 24 h. Finally, cells were fixed with 80%                    acetone and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-rabies N monoclonal antibody at                    37°C for 30 min, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Standard                    anti-rabies serum (30 IU/ml) was used as positive control. The average of                    duplicate samples was determined. The neutralizing antibody titer was calculated                    by the Reed–Muench method [17], [18].
A lethal animal model that mimicked rabies exposure was used as described                    previously [19]–[22]. Kunming mice (17 groups of eight mice, 10–12                    g) were infected with 100LD50/0.05 ml rabies virus CVS-11. Three                    hours later, prophylaxis was initiated with vaccine (diluted with PBS; Chiron                    Behring Vaccines) alone, single antibody (Fab094 or Fab094-CPNPs) alone, vaccine                    plus HRIG (20 IU/kg; Taibang Ltd., China), or vaccine plus 40, 32, 20, 8, 2 or                    0.5 IU/kg single monoclonal antibody (Fab094 or Fab094-CPNPs). As a negative                    control, one group was treated with PBS. On day 7, mice were vaccinated with                    rabies vaccine again, except for the negative control group. The mice were                    examined daily for clinical signs of rabies and death. The mice were maintained                    and evaluated at up to 28 days after infection. The experiments that involved                    the use of rabies strain CVS-11 were performed in a BSL-3 laboratory. At                    necropsy, brain impressions were made and tested for rabies virus antigen by the                    direct fluorescent antibody test [16], [20].
All data were processed and analyzed by SPSS10.0 Data Editor (SPSS Inc., Chicago,                    IL, USA). Fisher's exact test was used. The results in comparisons between                    groups were considered different if P was <0.05.
The Fab genes were successful amplified after three-step PCR (data not shown).                    The pooled Fab DNA was digested efficiently with SfiI and                    cloned to pComb3XSS, and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue to                    create a phage display antibody library with a capacity of                        6.7×108.
After five rounds of panning, 60 individual phage clones were selected randomly                    and amplified to test for specific binding to rabies virus, by phage ELISA                        (Figure 1). As shown in                        Fig. 1, 22 clones were                    representative clones of the 60, which had higher OD450 value, and                    analyzed by DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis, which indicated that four unique                    phages (named Fab092, Fab093, Fab094, Fab095) encoded the different Fab DNA                    sequences. Unlucky, only Fab094 has the neutralization activity and Fab 094 DNA                    sequence has been deposited in GenBank (the accession numbers: VH was HQ706884                    and VL was HQ706885).
Sixty individual bacterial clones were selected randomly after the fifth                            round of selection, to produce recombinant phages. As the negative                            control, empty phage was used. These phages were tested for their                            ability to bind to rabies virus protein by ELISA. Lane 1–22 were                            the representative clones of the 60, which had higher OD450                            value. Lane NC 1–2 were empty phages.
The soluble Fab094 was purified from the periplasm of the bacteria using protein                    L affinity purification. One liter of the bacterial cultures typically yielded                    approximately 2 mg of the finial purified Fab094 product. The purified Fab094                    was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting, which showed two bands at about                    30 and 26 kD (Figure 2).
(A) Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with                            Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Lane 1 shows the protein of purified Fab094.                            Lane M contained the molecular-mass markers. (B) Western blotting                            analysis of Fab094 with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (Fab-specific).                            Lane 1 shows the ultrasonic supernatant of Fab094 with HRP-conjugated                            anti-human IgG; lane 2 was the culture supernatant of Fab094 with                            HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG.
Immunoprecipitation was carried out with rabies virus strain CTN protein.                    Sixty-seven-kilodalton proteins were captured by Fab094, but they were not found                    in freeze–thaw lysates of BHK-21 cells, which are used routinely for                    rabies virus culture (Figure                        3A). Eight peptide sequences (Table 1) matched with rabies glycoprotein by                    MS analysis (Figure 3B) were                    found when the identified peptides were compared with the known sequences of                    rabies glycoprotein in the SWISS PROT database.
(A) Proteins immunoprecipitated by Fab094 were separated by SDS-PAGE and                            probed with mAb(C86307M) by Western blot. (M): protein marker. (1): One                            protein was recognized by mAb(C86307M). The molecular weight of the                            protein was about 67 kDa. (2): BHK-21 lysate was used as the negative                            control to replace Fab094 in the IP. (B): MS spectrums of fragment ions                            were from the 67 kDa protein. Eight major                            (m/z = 175.038, 262.012, 362.927, 463.973, 634.074,                            737.207, 852.205, 1370.649) ions were detected.
To ascertain whether Fab094 recognized rabies virus protein, virus-infected cells                    were incubated with Fab094 followed by FITC-labeled anti-human IgG                    (Fab-specific). The fluorescent antigens were detected on the surface of                    virus-infected cells (Figure                        4). These findings suggested that Fab094 recognized the authentic                    rabies virus protein.
The slides were observed by fluorescence microscopy (400×). A:                            rabies-virus-infected cells stained with Fab094; B: normal BHK-21 cells                            with Fab094.
Four Fab antibody preparations were examined for neutralization activity against                    rabies virus strain CVS-11, but only Fab094 exhibited neutralizing activity                    (described below). Following, Fab094 was loaded calcium phosphate nanoparticles                    and named as Fab094-CPNPs. The average size of nanoparticle was 260 nm.
The Fab094 neutralizing activity measured by RFFIT was 200.11 IU/mg, while that                    of Fab094-CPNPs was 246.12 IU/mg. Fab092, Fab093 and Fab095 failed to show any                    neutralizing activity against the CVS-11 strain.
The survival rate against CVS-11 infection is shown in Figure 5. Data indicated that 40 IU/kg Fab094                    or 8 IU/kg Fab094-CPNPs (62.5%, figure data not shown) provided a level                    of protection against rabies comparable with that provided by 20 IU/kg HRIG.                    These data illustrated that Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs had strong neutralizing                    potential, and Fab094-CPNPs had stronger neutralizing potential than Fab094 at                    an equivalent concentration. The survival rate in mice treated with Fab094 or                    Fab094-CPNPs alone was 12.5% and 25%, respectively. This result                    also showed that antibody without vaccine did not prevent rabies infection.                    Statistical analysis showed that the survival rates of groups with 40 IU/kg                    Fab094, 32 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg Fab094-CPNPs were significantly higher than                    control group (P<0.05). Necropsy of the brain showed that                    all mice had infection with rabies virus (data not shown).
Kunming mice (17 groups of eight mice, 10–12 g) were infected with                                100LD50/0.05 ml rabies virus CVS-11. Three hours later,                            prophylaxis was initiated with vaccine (diluted with PBS; Chiron Behring                            Vaccines) alone, single antibody (Fab094 or Fab094-CPNPs) alone, vaccine                            plus HRIG (20 IU/kg; Taibang Ltd., China), or vaccine plus 40, 32, 20, 2                            or 0.5 IU/kg single monoclonal antibody (Fab094 or Fab094-CPNPs). As a                            negative control, one group was treated with PBS. On day 7, mice were                            vaccinated with rabies vaccine again, except for the negative control                            group. The mice were examined daily for clinical signs of rabies and                            death. The mice were maintained and evaluated at up to 28 days after                            infection. The mice were monitored twice daily and were killed when                            clinical signs of rabies appeared. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are                            shown for days 0–15. The mice were monitored until day 28 after                            treatment (no additional deaths occurred between days 16 and 28).
Rabies virus entry occurs through wounds or direct contact with mucosal surfaces. For                PEP, early local injection-site reactions that consist of erythema and itching are                not uncommon with purified HRIG and ERIG. Published data indicate that                immunoglobulins can be injected safely into already infected animal bite wounds                after proper wound cleaning and administration of appropriate antibiotics [23]. Human                monoclonal antibodies produced in accordance with industrial standards could provide                a good solution to the current global shortage of HRIG [20]. To date, some antibody                engineering technologies have been developed to achieve this goal: fully humanized                antibodies are derived by immunizing transgenic mice, and selecting the recombinant                human antibody native or immunized phage display libraries. In comparison to other                technologies, antibody phage display has the advantages of being inexpensive and                highly efficient. The study of antigen panning, sequencing and purification to                obtain a specific antibody fragment typically can be completed within several weeks.                We have successfully constructed a human immunized Fab phage library with a                diversity of 6.7×108, and that library was used in the present                study to generate a neutralization Fab fragment against rabies virus.
In this study, we constructed an immunized phage display antibody library using RNA                from human peripheral blood lymphocytes from 45 rabies-vaccinated volunteers. The                neutralizing human Fab antibody fragments were selected from this library with whole                rabies virus particles. Among the selected Fab clones, Fab094 revealed neutralizing                activity against strain CVS-11 when tested by RFFIT. Immunoprecipitation and MS                assay showed that the Fab094 fragments bound to the glycoprotein of CTN strain,                which is epidemic in China [13].
The aim of the present study was to generate a human Fab fragment that recognized                rabies virus glycoprotein and was able to inhibit virions binding to and entering                humanized cells, therefore, the antigen panning strategy was crucial. To obtain                phage clones of high specificity and affinity for rabies virus, we maximized the                library density of phage to about 1014 pfu/ml, which is the highest                concentration to which phage can be condensed for the first round of panning. This                procedure yielded an average of 2.5×105 clones. In addition, the                wash step in the first round was not sufficiently stringent to elute phage for                amplification, to increase the chance that all of the rabies-virus-binding phages                were collected. If there were <105 eluted phages, the specific phage                might have failed to be enriched. The conventional panning method is to use                recombinant antigen coated on a solid substrate; usually a microtiter plate.                However, the antigen on the virus surface might be different from the purified                protein because of the conformational changes, and this could decrease the chances                of isolating phages that bind to the protein. In the present study, the whole virus                particles used as a vaccine were used to coat the immunoplates for phage panning, to                select the antibody that bound to the antigen in native comformation.
Several studies have confirmed that the glycoprotein is the important antigen of                rabies virus; it is capable of inducing and binding neutralizing antibodies to the                virus, which confer immunity against a lethal challenge infection with the virus                    [24],                    [25]. In                the present study, western blotting (Fig. 2) and MS (Fig.                    3) showed that Fab094 could bind with the 67 kD glycoprotein of rabies                virus, which suggests that Fab094 might have the ability to neutralize rabies                virus.
Ando et al. have described two rabies-virus-neutralizing Fabs isolated from a                combinatorial human Fab phage display library, but two antibodies exhibited                neutralizing activity with an infected cell count reduction of 76% or                57% at a dilution of 1∶2, and of 20% or 41% at a dilution                of 1∶4 [1]. In                the present study, RFFIT was used to measure Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs. The data                showed that the titration by RFFIT was 200.11 IU/mg (Fab094) and 246.12 IU/mg                (Fab094-CPNPs). The data also indicated that Fab094-CPNPs had higher neutralization                activity than Fab094 at an equivalent concentration.
Furthermore, in vivo studies indicated that treatment of Kunming                mice with each rabies antibody resulted in protection equivalent to that offered by                HRIG when mice were challenged with a lethal rabies virus dose. In the vaccine only                group, the survival rate was low (25%). This could have been because the                injection site of rabies was in the foreleg of the mice, which was close to the                central nervous system and brain, or perhaps the virus had invaded the neurocytes                before vaccine-induced antibody production. This result also suggests that vaccine                alone cannot provide sufficient survival, and antibody must be used in category III                PEP. Similarly, antibody alone did not provide sufficient protection. This might be                related to antibody degradation in vivo. In mice treated with                Fab094 and vaccine, the survival rates increased with dosage. A clear dose effect                was observed in the mice treated with 40, 32, 20, 8, 2 and 0.5 IU/kg Fab094, which                produced survival rates of 75%, 50%, 37.5%, 37.5%,                37.5% and 37.5%, respectively. This indicated that 40 IU/kg Fab094                provided a level of protection against rabies comparable with that provided by 20                IU/kg HRIG, which illustrated the strong neutralizing potency of Fab094. For                Fab094-CPNPs, 8 IU/kg antibody plus vaccine provided a protective rate that was                equal to that with 20 IU/kg HRIG plus vaccine. The reasons for this phenomenon                should be studied further. Taken together, these results indicate that the human                Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs, especially the latter, might be efficacious candidate drugs                to replace RIG for rabies PEP.
In conclusion, the current study describes the isolation of human Fabs with                rabies-virus-neutralizing activity from a human immunized phage display library                using peripheral blood lymphocytes from 45 rabies hyper-immune volunteers in China.                In addition, we developed Fab094-CPNPs and tested their efficacy by in                    vitro neutralization assay. This conclusion was confirmed by an                    in vivo Kunming mice challenge model. These results demonstrate                that human Fab094 and Fab094-CPNPs might be efficacious candidate drugs to replace                RIG for rabies PEP.
