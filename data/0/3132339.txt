Graft survival after living donor transplantation


Sir,
I am intrigued by the donor criterion mentioned by Hassanzadeh et al.,[1] accepting donors whose last preoperative serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dL or lower. While the fate of the donor was not part of their original study, I would be interested to know if they have studied the renal function of the donors 10 years after donor nephrectomy.
