Zygomycosis in pregnancy


Sir,
Zygomycosis is an uncommon deep fungal infection. The recent report on zygomycosis in a pregnant case with diabetes mellitus is very interesting.[1] Hayat et al. mentioned that this might be the first documented cases. However, there are some previous similar case reports. The first rhino-orbital zygomycosis in pregnancy has already been reported in India by Goel et al.[2] The case reported by Goel et al., had underlying liver disease and multiple organ disorder. Specifically, a case of zygomycosis in a diabetic pregnant patient has been reported by Trivedi et al.[3] Therefore, the problem of zygomycosis in diabetic pregnancy is not new, but is an important concern in obstetrical endocrinology.
