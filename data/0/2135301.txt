DISTRIBUTION OF THE Rh FACTOR IN AMERICAN INDIANS

 Erythrocytes from 120 full blooded American Indians and 155 Indians of mixed ancestry were tested for the Rh agglutinogen. Only a single blood among the full blooded Indians appeared to lack this factor, and in the Indians known not to be full blooded, the distribution of this (and other) blood properties was found to be intermediate between that for whites and pure Indians according to expectation. A variant of Rh demonstrable by a special human serum was more than twice as frequent in full blooded Indians as in white individuals.
