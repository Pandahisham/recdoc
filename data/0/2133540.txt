THE CALCIUM CONTENT OF THE KIDNEY AS RELATED TO PARATHYROID FUNCTION

 Partial nephrectomy in rats leads to an increase in the calcium content of the residual renal tissue. This increase is correlated with enlargement of the parathyroid glands, the degree depending upon the severity of the kidney lesions. Early removal of the parathyroid glands almost completely prevents this increase in kidney calcium.
