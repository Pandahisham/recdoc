7 Near-Hanging Injuries in an Urban Emergency Department


To evaluate emergency medicine (EM) residents’ ability to detect ocular pathology using portable ultrasound (US) in a live porcine model.
This was a single-blinded outcome study to determine both the validity of a live porcine model to evaluate ocular pathology and to assess the ability of EM residents to accurately diagnose ocular pathology using handheld US. Subjects were EM residents who had undergone a two-day US course as part of their EM orientation month and had reviewed a one-hour self-instruction computer tutorial on ocular US prior to the study. Vitreous hemorrhages, retro-orbital hemorrhages and intraocular foreign bodies were simulated by placement of porcine blood and metallic objects under ultrasound guidance out of view of the subject population. Residents then performed self-directed US of two eyes each and were asked to comment on any pathology observed. Time required for each scan was noted.
72 scans were performed to examine for vitreous hemorrhage, retro-orbital hemorrhage, and intraocular foreign bodies. EM residents were able to detect a significant abnormality greater than 93% (95CI 87–99%) of the time. Vitreous hemorrhage was the most detectable injury with over 95% (95CI 86–100%) accuracy. A with intraocular foreign bodies 97% (95CI 90–100%) of the time with a clear diagnosis of foreign body noted in 73% (95CI 57–89%) of the cases. Retro-orbital hemorrhage was the most difficult to detect with 62% (95CI 41–83%) accuracy. The average time taken for scanning two eyes was 458 sec. Central retinal artery flow was detected in 100% of the 26 cases in which this was documented. Accuracy of diagnoses was similar across levels of EM training.
EM residents can accurately diagnose significant ocular pathology using handheld US in a live porcine model. This is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of such a model.
