An organizational approach is proposed as an immediate solution for improvingpostoperative pain (POP) management. The aim was to evaluate the clinical effectivenessof a quality management system (QMS), based on procedure-specific, multimodal analgesicprotocols, modified to meet the individual patients’ requirements.
Patients from the orthopaedic, gynaecological, visceral, and trauma surgery departmentsof the university hospital were involved in two prospective surveys. Survey 1 wasperformed at baseline and survey 2 was performed after the implementation of QMS withinan interval of 1 year. The patients were asked to report pain intensity on the visualrating scale, incidence of analgesia-related side-effects, and incidence of paininterference with the items of life quality and their satisfaction with the treatment ofPOP.
Patients from Survey 2 (n=251) reported 25–30%less pain than those from Survey 1 (n=269)(P<0.0001). Nausea was reported by 40% of the patientsfrom Survey 1 vs 17% from Survey 2, vomiting by 25vs 11% and fatigue by 76% in Survey 1vs 30% in Survey 2 (P<0.0001). Lifequality and patients’ satisfaction improved in Survey 2 vsSurvey 1 (P<0.001).
The implementation of QMS allowed the reduction in POP intensity with a simultaneousdecrease in analgesia-related side-effects. This has led to an increased quality of lifeand patient satisfaction.

Despite recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of acute pain and thedevelopment of new approaches in treating postoperative pain (POP), the clinical situationregarding POP treatment needs further improvement.1 Postoperative patients still report high levels of acute pain in theaftermath of surgery, while simultaneously experiencing the side-effects of analgesics, usedfor POP treatment.23 In the US hospital environment,80% of patients reported experiencing pain after surgery, 86% of themcomplained of moderate, severe, or extreme pain.4 In a Dutch cohort of 1490 patients, who had received POP treatmentaccording to the standard acute pain protocol, 40% reported moderate or severe painwhile at rest on the day after surgery.5 In a German collective of 2252 postoperative patients, the median value ofmaximal pain intensity reached 5/10 and pain intensity whilst moving reached 4/10. Thesevalues were associated with unsatisfactory pain treatment.6 At the same time, according to pooled data fromprospective studies with more than 100 000 patients, the modern treatment of POP wasassociated with 30% of patients suffering from nausea, 20% from vomiting, and24% from excessive sedation.2
Recently, experts proposed a new, organizational approach, based on our understanding ofthe pathophysiology of acute pain, the pharmacology of analgesics and clinical requirements,as an immediate solution for improving the management of POP.7 This approach applies three principles in routine clinicalpractice, to achieve an effective POP management: (i) multimodal therapies8 reflected in; (ii) evidence-basedprocedure-specific protocols9; (iii)adjusted to the patients’ individual analgesic requirements.10
In Germany, several groups of experts in the field of POP, supported by quality assurancemethodology, used these three principles to initiate quality management systems (QMSs) aimedat improving POP treatment.11 One ofthese QMS, entitled ‘Treatment of postoperative and posttraumatic pain’,guided and certified by the German quality and safety monitoring agency, TÜVRheinland,12 was introduced in2008 at the University Hospital of Greifswald (Germany). This teaching hospital has 880beds, 406 of which belong to 11 surgical departments. The QMS has been introduced in allsurgical departments.
The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the QMS,introduced at the university hospital and to study the results of its implementation onpatients’ satisfaction with the treatment of POP and its influence on quality oflife.
This prospective anonymous pre/post questionnaireinvestigation was conducted at the university hospital. After approval from the localethics committee, patients from 4 (175 beds) of the 11 surgical departments such asvisceral surgery, gynaecology, orthopaedics, and traumatology were consecutively enrolled,in accordance with selection criteria in two prospective surveys. Patients, who undergoelective surgery with anticipated intensity of POP of ≥3/10 on an 11-point NRS(a priori defined procedure-specific POP intensity, depending on thesize and localization of surgical lesion),13 were asked to participate in the survey. The patients had to be ableto fill out the study questionnaire on the first postoperative day and on the day ofdischarge and gave their informed signed consent to participate in the study. Patients,who were younger than 18 yr old, with chronic pain and those with insufficient knowledgeof the German language or with cognitive limitations were not included. The patients wereinformed that they would be participating in a routine quality assurance survey of thehospital, thus the patients remained unaware ‘blinded’ of the purpose of theinvestigation. Survey 1 was performed at baseline from January to June 2008; Survey 2 wasperformed after the implementation of QMS from September 2009 to March 2010(Fig. 1). Fig 1Flow diagram of the study. A pilot pre-test study was performed in 30patients to test the POP questionnnaire (PPQ) and to generate the data forcalculation of the sample size for the study. The first survey was performed in thefirst half of 2008, where 296 patients received the PPQ on the first postoperativeday and on the day of the surgery. The second survey was performed after theimplementation of Quality Management Program in treatment of POP in 294 patients.QMS, quality management system.

Basic analgesia was provided by the non-opioid analgesics acetaminophen, ibuprofen, andmetamizole (Fig. 2). In cases ofexpected moderate-to-severe pain, opioids were added, including oral tramadol orparenteral piritramide (opioid receptor agonist with 0.7 analgesic potency of morphine),applied via patient-controlled analgesia pumps (Fig. 2, Supplementary A and B). Continuous regional and epidural analgesia (EDA)with ropivacaine were used for POP treatment after orthopaedic, thoracic, and visceralsurgery, where appropriate, according to above-mentioned PROSPECT9 and DGAI17 guidelines on POP treatment. No new analgesic drugswere introduced during the investigation.
A pilot pre-test study was performed on 30 patients to obtain the data for thecalculation of the sample size for the present study and to test the POP questionnaire(POP-Q). POP-Q was developed on the basis of a previously validated Brief PainInventory19 and included:Five items to report on the 1st postoperative day(POP-Qs);Nine items to report on the day of discharge (POP-Qd).The five items of POP-Qs were: the intensity of (i) maximal pain; (ii) minimal painafter surgery; (iii) pain while at rest and while in movement at that moment; (iv)presence of tiredness, nausea, and vomiting; (v) satisfaction with pain therapy. Pain onmovement was registered as the pain intensity during physiotherapeutic mobilization inpatients after musculoskeletal surgery; after thoracic and abdominal surgery pain oncoughing was the equivalent.
Five items to report on the 1st postoperative day(POP-Qs);
Nine items to report on the day of discharge (POP-Qd).
The nine items of POP-Qd included the five POP-Qs items supplemented by: (i) presence ofPOP at all; (ii) pain intensity while at rest and while in movement immediately aftersurgery; (iii) whether pain disturbed the following aspects: sleep, mood, mobility,communication with others, and enjoyment of life; (iv) whether the patient had receivedanalgesics for more than 6 months before the surgery.
All items concerning pain intensity were measured using a visual rating scale (VRS-11)from 0=no pain to 10=maximal pain imaginable. Satisfaction with the POPtreatment was measured using a VRS-5 from 1=excellent to 5=bad, which, tofacilitate the rating, resembles the scale of grades in German schools.
On the day of surgery, consecutive patients were selected according to the eligibilitycriteria, using the data from intranet software with the surgery plan. On the firstpostoperative day, these patients received and filled out the POP-Qs. The POP-Qd was leftfor patients until the day of discharge, whereas the nurses of the department were askedto collect the completed POP-Qd.
The intensity of pain taken on VRS-11, side-effects of analgesia, life quality items andpatients’ satisfaction with their POP treatment were registered as the measurementof results. Moreover, to compare the severity of surgical procedures between the surveys,each patient received the value of a priori defined POP intensity, usingthe previously described procedure-specific POP intensity scale.13 An experienced consultant surgeon (J.L.) blindlyscaled all surgeries using that a priori POP intensity scale.
To calculate the sample size, we used the data from a pilot pre-test study, assuming aprobability of 0.05 and power of 80%. To detect a reduction in POP intensity of atleast 30% from baseline, we calculated a sample size of at least 240 patients foreach period of measurement pre/post (60 patients fromeach department). Anticipating a poor rate of returned questionnaires in the surveyinvestigations, we planned to distribute 300 PPQ for eachpre/post survey.
The collected data from Survey 1 was compared with that of Survey 2, using the SPSS 19.0for Mac software and both presented as mean values with standard deviation or median withinterquartile range, to give better characteristics of data distribution. Normally,distributed data were analysed using Student's t-test, skewed datawere compared using the Mann–Whitney test. Binomially distributed data wereanalysed using the χ2 test and presented as frequencydistribution with absolute numbers and relative distribution in per cent.
The POP questionnaire was returned by 269 (91%) of the patients from Survey 1(before QMS implementation) and by 251 (85%) from Survey 2 (after QMSimplementation). The collective of the Survey 1 patients was comparable with that of theSurvey 2, in terms of patient characteristics, ASA health status, and prevalence ofanalgesic use for more than 6 months before the surgery (Table 1). The patients from both surveys receivedperioperative catheters for regional and EDA in a comparable number of cases. Theanticipated a priori pain intensity scores13 were also similar in patients from both surveys(Table 1). The detailed number ofsurgical procedures is given in Table 2. Table 1Baseline data (N=520).

Survey 2 patients reported less pain than their counterparts in Survey 1 in allcategories and time-points of measurement (Table 3). Maximal pain intensity after surgery reported by Survey 2patients was lower than that reported by Survey 1: 4.6 (95% CI: 4.3–4.9)vs 6.0 (95% CI: 5.7–6.3);P<0.0001, as well as Survey 2’s pain while in movement onthe first postoperative day being reported as less than Survey 1’s: 3.6 (95%CI: 3.3–3.8) vs 4.9 (95% CI: 4.6–5.2),P<0.0001. Before the implementation of the QMS, the patientswere discharged to go home with a pain intensity (in movement) of 2.7 (95% CI:2.5–2.9), after QMS implementation the patients reported 1.6 (95% CI:1.5–1.8); P<0.0001, before their being discharged. Theanalysis of the prevalence for weak, moderate, and severe pain intensity on movement,taken on the first postoperative day, demonstrated that 43% of the Survey 1patients vs 13% of the patients from Survey 2 had reported severepain (defined as higher than 6 on the 10-point scale of VRS-11;P<0.0001). Figure 3 gives the prevalence of severe pain, split to levels 6–7 (VRS-11) and8–10 (extremely high pain). Extremely high pain was reported by 19% of theSurvey 1 patients vs 3% of Survey 2 patients(P<0.0001). Four per cent of the Survey 1 patientsvs 9% of their Survey 2 counterparts had reported no pain at allafter surgery (P=0.02).

Analgesic side-effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and tiredness, decreased to nearly halfafter implementation of QMS. Thirty-eight per cent of the Survey 1 patientsvs 26% reported nausea on the first postoperative day(P=0.003), on the day of discharge, there were 40% of theSurvey 1 patients, who reported nausea vs 17% in Survey 2(P<0.0001; Fig. 4). Vomiting was reported by 24% of the Survey 1 patients and by18% in Survey 2 on the first postoperative day (P=0.1); onthe day of discharge, 25% of the patients from Survey 1 and 11% from Survey2 reported vomiting (P<0.0001). Eighty-one per cent of the Survey1 patients and 51% from Survey 2 mentioned tiredness on the first postoperativeday; on the day of discharge, 76% of the Survey 1 patients and 30% of thepatients in Survey 2 reported this side-effect of opioid analgesia(P<0.0001).

The implementation of QMS was associated with an improvement of measured items of lifequality that usually are disturbed by pain in the postoperative period. On the day ofdischarge, 84% of the Survey 1 patients and 72% of the Survey 2(P=0.01) reported that POP disturbed general activity.Sixty-five per cent of the patients of Survey 1 vs 47% of Survey 2(P<0.0001) complained that POP disturbed their sleep. POPdisturbed the enjoyment of life in 55% of the Survey 1 patients vs39% of the Survey 2 patients (P=0.001). Satisfaction withthe therapy of POP also improved in Survey 2 vs in Survey 1(P<0.001; Table 4).

The introduction of the QMS for treatment of POP, based on clinical implementation ofevidence-based procedure-specific protocols of multimodal analgesia, adjusted to individualpatients’ requirements has led to an improvement of the POP treatment in surgicalpatients at the university hospital. The implementation of QMS was associated with lower POPlevels and with a simultaneous reduction of analgesia-related side-effects, improved dailyactivity, sleep, and an overall satisfaction with the treatment of POP.
The values of clinically relevant pain categories (maximal pain and pain on movement) werereduced by 25–30% from the baseline level (Survey 1) after implementation ofQMS (Table 2). Baseline levels of painintensity, measured at 5–6 (median, VRS-11) for maximal pain and at 5 for pain whilein movement, are in accordance with previous investigations of the same design, which alsodescribed the pain-reducing clinical effect of QMS implementation.20–22The effect size of POP reduction (pain on movement on the first postoperative day) after QMSimplementation from 4.9 (2.5) during Survey 1 to 3.5 (1.9) [mean (sd); VRS-11]during Survey 2 (30% reduction) was comparable with pain relief effect of EDAcompared with i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids.23 In this meta-analysis, Wu andcolleagues23 calculated the painintensity on movement on the first postoperative day with PCA at 4.9 (1.1)vs EDA 3.4 (1.0) [mean (sd); VAS-11].
The improvement in the mean POP values in our investigation is due to a decrease inpatients with severe (6–7; median on VRS-11) and extremely high (8–10 onVRS-11) pain after QMS implementation (Fig. 3). Such a ‘shift’ in patients from the prevalence groups with ahigh level of POP to lower pain level groups, acceptable as not disturbing the quality oflife (<4 on VRS-11) was also demonstrated in previous investigations, studying theimplementation of comparable QMS.1420
Since no new drugs were introduced to the analgesic regimen at the time of the QMSimplementation, the observed improvement in pain reduction is likely to be due to thecombined effect of a rapid and more differentiated delivery of analgesics (preventiveadministration according to expected a priori pain intensity, earlyadministration according to evidence-based procedure-specific guidelines, titrationaccording to individual analgesic requirements of patients, etc.) as well as a number ofunspecific factors. These factors include preoperative information to patients about the POPtreatment, enhanced attention to treatment of pain, and related side-effects of analgesicsby medical staff and regular visits by the acute pain service.24
The frequency of the use of regional analgesia for POP treatment was comparable inpatients’ collectives from both surveys. However, we observed the dramatic reductionin opioid-related side-effects such as nausea, vomiting (N&V), and tirednesssubsequent to the implementation of QMS (Fig. 4). This nearly 50% reduction in the incidence of N&V can beexplained by an initially high level (40% for nausea and 25% for vomiting) ofthese opioid-related side-effects at baseline (Survey 1), on the one hand, and by theimplementation of evidence-based guidelines for PONV prevention and treatment,18 as an element of the QMS, on the otherhand. The former was probably due to the pre-selection of the patients for thisinvestigation who had received balanced general anaesthesia with volatile anaesthetic andopioid analgesics and who had required i.v. opioid analgesics for the POP treatment with theexpected a priori pain level of >5 on NRS-11. Both of thesetreatments may have produced a high incidence of PONV, as reported by the patients duringSurvey 1, both on the first postoperative day and on the day of their discharge, but not bySurvey 2 patients (Table 3). DuringSurvey 2, the incidence of both N&V decreased during the postoperative period,suggesting the effectiveness of QMS. Variations in tiredness showed a similar tendency: (i)a high level on both days of investigation at baseline (Survey 1); (ii) a decrease in Survey2 in comparison with Survey 1 after QMS implementation; and (iii) a significant decreaseduring Survey 2 between the first postoperative day and the day of discharge. Interestingly,none of the previous investigations, which also have statistically demonstrated asignificant decrease in pain levels, showed a decrease in analgesic-relatedside-effects.14–1620–22Fig 4Frequency of opioid-induced side-effects on the first postoperative day(a) and on the day of discharge (b) given as per cent from totalnumber of patients in the survey; numeric values are absolute number ofpatients;*P<0.0001;χ2-test.

It is likely that the 25–30% decrease in the POP level and the reduction inanalgesic-related side-effects led to an improvement in daily activity, sleep, and enjoymentof life. However, the psychological effects of increased attention by medical staff cannotbe ruled out. The patients’ satisfaction with pain therapy had also improved afterthe implementation of the QMS.
These improvements in POP management can be partly attributed to the Hawthorne effect, whenthe act of measuring induces changes itself. However, the size of the Hawthorne effect ismuch smaller, than the effects found in our study25 and it usually disappears within 8 weeks since the introduction of‘something new’.26Moreover, in order to keep the Hawthorne effect (motivation of personnel, participating inQMS on POP treatment) working, the German quality and safety monitoring agency, TÜVRheinland, incorporated special monitoring/quality assurance measures, including externaland internal audits (see section ‘Quality management system’, statementx).
The inability to apply a multi-centred, parallel-group randomized design was the majorlimitation of this study. However, it would be complicated to apply this ‘goldstandard’ of clinical research because of organizational and ethical reasons. Infact, we do not see the single-centred design as a drawback: on the contrary, our carefullyconducted investigation at a single institution had succeeded in demonstrating clinicalimprovement after QMS implementation. However, the large-scale patient survey, performed in37 US hospitals after implementation of the Postoperative Pain Management QualityImprovement Project, demonstrated an improvement in structures and processes, critical toimproving pain management (such as documented use of pain rating scales, decreased use ofi.m. opioids, and the increased use of non-pharmacological strategies), although there wasno change in pain results.16 Ourinvestigation was focused on the effectiveness of QMS for POP treatment, suggestedpreviously in numerous publications,679111227 and was not aimed at showing thecausal links of expected changes. Another limitation was the absence of cost analysis, whichmight have provided insight into the causal relationships of changes discovered during thestudy. The next steps may be: (i) cost-effectiveness analysis, including expenses ofpersonnel and analgesics, to evaluate the economic aspects of QMS implementation; (ii) studythe influence of QMS on ‘hard’ clinical outcomes—perioperativemorbidity and mortality; and (iii) prevent the development of persistent postsurgicalpain.28
The implementation of QMS has led to a clinically significant improvement of POP treatment,accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in analgesia-related side-effects, which have led toan increased quality of life and the satisfaction of the patients.
