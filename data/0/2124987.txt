STUDIES ON FERMENT ACTION 

 1. Erythrocytes have definite lipoidal constituents and lipoidal combinations peculiar to the species. 2. Certain lipoids and lipoidal combinations act as specific antigens. 3. The increase in serum lipase which occurs upon immunization of animals to foreign red cells is, at least in part, specific. 4. This specific lipase plays, no doubt, an important part in specific serum hemolyses.
