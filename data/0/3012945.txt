One year period prevalence was found to be 3.7%. 90% of the respondents believed in possession. Women more than men shared this belief. Spirit possession was reported to be troublesome but God possession as helpful. Number of God possession cases exceeded tint of spirit possession. Female sex, young age, low education appeared to predispose an individual to get possessed in such atmosphere.
