Poster #115Y: Two Distinct Phenotypes in 11 Individuals, Demonstrating Alternate Unbalanced Recombinants Derived from a Cryptic Paternal Balanced Translocation between Chromosomes 10 and 14


Dear colleagues,
Maimonides, known as the Rambam, was one of the greatest Jewish arbiters; he was also a scientist, a researcher, and one of the greatest philosophers of the medieval ages. In fact, he was among the first to support evidence-based medicine.
This Supplement of the Rambam Maimonides Medical Journal presents the abstracts from Rambam Research Day. These abstracts represent the newest basic and clinical research coming out of Rambam Health Care Campus—research that is the oxygen for education and development of today’s generation of physicians. Hence, the research presented on Rambam Research Day is a foundation for future generations to understand patient needs and improve treatment modalities. Bringing research from the bench to the bedside and from the bedside to the community is at the heart of Maimonides’ scholarly and ethical legacy.
We hope you will appreciate the potential represented in these abstracts, which touch on nearly every aspect of clinical practice.
I would also like to thank Ms. Deborah Hemstreet, for the invaluable and professional editorial work that went into making this special issue of RMMJ possible.
The Rambam Maimonides Medical Journal would be pleased to publish other original basic and clinical research articles, and related abstracts, which will subsequently be applied to patient care. In addition, we are open to publishing such abstracts from meetings, seminars, or conferences. For more information on seeing your event’s abstracts published here, please contact our editorial board.
Sincerely Yours,
