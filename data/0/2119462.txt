A severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model for infection with Entamoeba histolytica

We used severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice to study resistance to invasive infection with Entamoeba histolytica. Seven of seven SCID mice developed liver abscesses when challenged intrahepatically with virulent HM1:IMSS strain E. histolytica trophozoites. Only one of seven similarly challenged immunocompetent congenic C.B-17 mice developed an abscess. Adoptive transfer of polyclonal rabbit anti-E. histolytica antiserum, but not preimmune rabbit serum, completely protected 7 of 12 SCID mice from intrahepatic challenge with ameba. These results demonstrate that lymphocyte-based immunity is important in protection against amebic liver abscess, and that anti-E. histolytica antibody can protect against amebic infection in this system. The SCID mouse may provide a powerful model for studying the components of protective immunity to invasive amebiasis.
