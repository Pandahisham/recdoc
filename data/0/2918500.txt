Genome instability, associated with chromosome breakage syndromes and most human                    cancers, is still poorly understood. In the yeast Saccharomyces                        cerevisiae, numerous genes with roles in the preservation of genome                    integrity have been identified. DNA-damage-checkpoint-deficient yeast cells that                    lack Sgs1, a RecQ-like DNA helicase related to the human                    Bloom's-syndrome-associated helicase BLM, show an increased rate of                    genome instability, and we have previously shown that they accumulate recurring                    chromosomal translocations between three similar genes, CAN1,                        LYP1 and ALP1. Here, the chromosomal                    location, copy number and sequence similarity of the translocation targets                        ALP1 and LYP1 were altered to gain insight                    into the formation of complex translocations. Among 844 clones with chromosomal                    rearrangements, 93 with various types of simple and complex translocations                    involving CAN1, LYP1 and ALP1                    were identified. Breakpoint sequencing and mapping showed that the formation of                    complex translocation types is strictly dependent on the location of the                    initiating DNA break and revealed that complex translocations arise via a                    combination of interchromosomal translocation and template-switching, as well as                    from unstable dicentric intermediates. Template-switching occurred between                    sequences on the same chromosome, but was inhibited if the genes were                    transferred to different chromosomes. Unstable dicentric translocations                    continuously gave rise to clones with multiple translocations in various                    combinations, reminiscent of intratumor heterogeneity in human cancers. Base                    substitutions and evidence of DNA slippage near rearrangement breakpoints                    revealed that translocation formation can be accompanied by point mutations, and                    their presence in different translocation types within the same clone provides                    evidence that some of the different translocation types are derived from each                    other rather than being formed de novo. These findings provide                    insight into eukaryotic genome instability, especially the formation of                    translocations and the sources of intraclonal heterogeneity, both of which are                    often associated with human cancers.

Structural changes to chromosomes, such as translocations, terminal fusions,                insertions, inversions or deletions, are often detrimental to normal cell                proliferation and are commonly associated with cancers, accelerated aging and                genomic disorders [1], [2], [3]. They are thought to result from non-homologous                endjoining (NHEJ) of double-strand breaks (DSBs) or from erroneous homologous                recombination (HR) between dispersed, nonallelic repeats (NAHR). HR events are                initiated by 3′ end invasion of identical duplex DNA, normally on a                homologous chromosome or a sister chromatid or, accidentally, nonallelic sequences.                Break-induced replication (BIR) has been invoked as an HR mechanism for the repair                of one-sided DSBs that may arise when a replication fork collapses at a nick in the                template or when telomeres erode [4], [5], [6], [7]. BIR is a                Rad52-dependent mechanism and requires long homology for successful strand invasion;                however, BIR requiring only microhomology has recently been proposed as a mechanism                for generating copy number variation in the human genome [8]. In addition, recent                evidence from yeast suggests that broken replication forks may also be substrates                for an HR-protein independent, replication-based template-switching mechanism that                is mediated by microhomology or microsatellites [9]. Despite these recent                advances, genetic and mechanistic understanding of the causes of genome instability                in model organisms as well as in human genome instability syndromes and cancer is                still lacking. With the identification of numerous genes and gene networks that are                required for the maintenance of genome stability, including DNA damage checkpoints,                DNA repair factors, proteins for processing of recombination substrates, as well as                components of chromatin assembly factors, the budding yeast Saccharomyces                    cerevisiae has emerged as a model organism for the study of genome                instability [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Members of the RecQ                family of DNA helicases have been recognized as important regulators of genome                integrity from bacteria to humans (reviewed in [20]). Yeast cells lacking the                RecQ-like helicase Sgs1 accumulate gross-chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), exhibit                elevated levels of mitotic recombination, have a reduced lifespan and are sensitive                to chemicals that alkylate DNA or slow replication forks [14], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. In                    vitro, Sgs1 is capable of unwinding various DNA substrates, but prefers                Holliday junctions, consistent with its proposed role in recombination [25]. Sgs1                has also been shown to facilitate formation of the 3′ overhang during the                processing of DSBs in preparation for strand invasion [26]. In humans, lack of                function of the RecQ-like DNA helicases BLM, WRN and RECQL4 is associated with                Bloom's, Werner and Rothmund-Thompson syndromes, respectively, which are                characterized by chromosome abnormalities, increased cancer susceptibility and/or                signs of premature aging [27], [28], [29]. Not unlike yeast cells lacking Sgs1, cells from                Bloom's syndrome patients exhibit aberrant and/or elevated levels of                genetic exchange and chromosome instability. The most striking characteristics of                cells from Bloom's syndrome patients include elevated rates of                sister-chromatid exchange, chromatid gaps, micronuclei and quadriradial structures                    [30], [31].
In an ongoing effort to elucidate genetic and mechanistic determinants of chromosome                instability in yeast, we previously identified various types of complex, recurring                translocations between three homeologous genes in yeast cells that lack Sgs1 and the                DNA-damage sensor Mec3 [18]. A candidate screen revealed that deletion of                other checkpoint components (Tel1, Rfc5, Rad24) or deletion of chromatin assembly                factors (Cac1, Asf1) also made sgs1Δ mutants susceptible to                these recurring translocations [19]. We determined that these translocations                originate in the CAN1 gene on chromosome V and target short                stretches of identical sequences in the related genes LYP1 and/or                    ALP1 on chromosome XIV, which share 60–65%                sequence identity with each other and with CAN1. Using the highly                susceptible sgs1Δ mec3Δ mutant as a source for                translocations, the goal of the present study was to gain insight into how the                various simple and complex translocations between CAN1,                    LYP1 and ALP1, and possibly chromosomal                translocations in general, are formed. For this purpose, we manipulated the                location, copy number and level of sequence similarity of the translocation targets                    ALP1 and LYP1 and determined the effect of                these changes on the accumulation, structure and stability of the translocation                chromosomes. We find that complex, multipartite translocations only form if                sequences of sufficient similarity are available on the same chromosome for                template-switching, whereas translocation formation involving two successive                interchromosomal rearrangements were not observed. Rather than giving rise to                inviable cells, dicentric chromosomes provide a continuous source for new viable                translocations and show signs of ongoing instability that leads to chromosome end                erosion. Point mutations and DNA slippage events that accompany some rearrangements                give further insight into the origin of stable translocations.
All strains used in this study are derived from Saccharomyces                        cerevisiae strain S288C and are listed in Table 1. For GCR rate measurements, desired                    gene deletions were introduced into KHSY802 (MATa,                        ura3-52, trp1Δ63,                        his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,                        lys2Bgl, hom3-10,                        ade2Δ1, ade8,                        hxt13::URA3), RDKY5027 (MATα,                        ura3-52, trp1Δ63,                        his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,                        lys2Bgl, hom3-10,                        ade2Δ1, ade8,                        hxt13::URA3) by HR-mediated integration of PCR products by                    the LiAc method [32]. All haploid strains for GCR rate                    measurements were obtained by sporulating diploids heterozygous for the desired                    mutations. Spores were genotyped on selective media or by PCR. Media for                    propagating strains have been previously described [33].                        ALP1 on chromosome XIV was deleted by inserting the                        loxP-kanMX6-loxP cassette from pUG6 (gift from S. Brill,                    Rutgers University) at ALP1, followed by                    Cre-recombinase-mediated removal of the kanMX6 cassette. To                    insert ALP1 into chromosome II, the ALP1 ORF                    was first inserted into pCR4 (Invitrogen) and a kanMX6 cassette                    was inserted downstream of ALP1 into the SpeI                    site of pCR4, yielding plasmid pKHS332. The                        ALP1.kanMX6 cassette from pKHS332 was then                    amplified by PCR and inserted into chromosome II downstream of                        HIS7 between nucleotides 714705 and 714707 in a yeast                    strain that had ALP1 on chromosome XIV deleted                        (ALP1::loxP) to improve the targeting efficiency to                    chromosome II. For site-directed mutagenesis, LYP1 was inserted                    into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and base substitutions A879T, C885T, G902A, A906G,                    C927T, C933T, C981A (LYP1-MUTABCDEF) were introduced using the                    QuickChange protocol (Stratagene), to generate plasmid pKHS318. A                        loxP-kanMX-loxP cassette was inserted into the                        PmeI site of pKHS318 and, together with                        lyp1-MUTABCDEF, used to replace the                    chromosomal LYP1. The kanMX6 cassette was                    excised from the chromosomal integration by transient Cre-recombinase                    expression. Unless notes otherwise, the CAN1 gene is in its                    wildtype location on chromosome V and a URA3 cassette was used                    to replace the HXT13 gene on chromosome V [10], [34].                    In the strain designated HR-wt, the LYP1 and                        ALP1 genes are at their wildtype loci on chromosome XIV                    (KHSY1530). HR-1 is identical to HR-wt except that a second copy of                        ALP1 was inserted into chromosome II as described above                    (KHSY2147). In HR-2 LYP1 is in the wildtype location whereas                        ALP1 on chromosome XIV was deleted and a copy of                        ALP1 was inserted into chromosome II (KHSY2612). In HR-3,                        ALP1 on chromosome XIV was deleted and no other copy of                        ALP1 exists in this strain (KHSY2098). In HR-4                        ALP1 is in its wildtype location whereas                        LYP1 was replaced with the mutant LYP1                    allele containing A879T, C885T, G902A, A906G, C927T, C933T, C981A base                    substitutions (KHSY3114).
Clones with spontaneous gross-chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) that originate in                    a 12-kb nonessential region of chromosome V, which contains                        CAN1, were obtained exactly as previously described [34].                    To identify GCR clones with translocations involving CAN1 and                        LYP1 and/or ALP1, GCR clones were screened                    by PCR. A primer pair that anneals to the 5′ end of                        CAN1 and to the 3′end of LYP1                    was used to amplify C/L translocations and a primer pair that                    anneals to the 5′end of CAN1 and the 3′end                    of ALP1 was used to amplify C/A and                        C/L/A translocations. PCR products were sequenced and                    analyzed by BLAST and Sequencher (GeneCodes) to distinguish between                        C/A and C/L/A translocations and to                    identify fusion sites. Translocations terminating in ALP1 on                    chromosome XIV were distinguished from those terminating in                        ALP1 on chromosome II by PCR using a primer pair that                    anneals to the 5′ end of CAN1 and downstream of                        ALP1 ORF on chromosome XIV, or a primer pair that anneals                    to the 5′end of CAN1 and within the                        kanMX6 cassette linked to the ALP1 ORF                    insertion on chromosome II, respectively.
Genomic DNA was extracted from a YPD culture inoculated with a single colony of                    the GCR clone. Proteins were removed by three rounds of                    phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol extraction. Ten micrograms of genomic DNA at a                    concentration of 250 ng/µl were used per array. The parental strain                    RDKY3615 with an intact chromosome V was used as the reference genomic DNA.                    Hybridization, array scanning and data extraction are performed by NimbleGen                    Systems, Inc. The CGH array used for this analysis covers the S.                        cerevisiae genome using 45–85mer isothermal probes with a                    median probe spacing of 12 bp.
Previously we showed that cells lacking Sgs1 and the DNA damage sensor Mec3 are                    particularly susceptible to translocations between CAN1 and                        ALP1 (C/A), CAN1 and                        LYP1 (C/L), or even all three related                    genes (C/L/A) [19]. Unexpectedly, the more complex tripartite                        C/L/A translocations arise as frequently as the simple                        C/A translocations, leading us to hypothesize that                    intrachromosomal rearrangements between the LYP1 and                        ALP1 genes, which are located on the same arm of chromosome                    XIV, may promote tripartite translocation formation. Here, to elucidate the                    formation of these tripartite translocations, the ALP1 and                        LYP1 loci were modified in an sgs1Δ                        mec3Δ mutant and the effect of these manipulations on the                    rate and type of translocations as well as on gene fusion site selection was                    determined. In addition to the yeast strain with CAN1,                        LYP1 and ALP1 in their wildtype locations                    (HR-wt), four new strains were constructed (Figure 1). The first strain, HR-1, contains a                    second copy of ALP1 on chromosome II in the same orientation                    and at a distance from the telomere similar to that of ALP1 on                    chromosome XIV. In this strain, ALP1 on chromosome XIV competes                    with ALP1 on chromosome II as a translocation target for                        LYP1. While ALP1 on chromosome XIV can be                    utilized for intrachromosomal rearrangements with                        LYP1, ALP1 on chromosome II can be                    utilized for interchromosomal rearrangements with                        LYP1. Thus, in theory, the complex C/L/A                    translocations in HR-1 can arise either by rearrangement between chromosomes V                    and XIV, or by rearrangement between three different chromosomes. The standard                    GCR assay, which selects for clones that had suffered a spontaneous DNA break                    within a 12 kb region on chromosome V that also includes the                        CAN1 gene [34], was used to collect 423 clones from HR-1                    with various chromosome V rearrangements, which may include de                        novo telomere additions, insertions, inversions, large interstitial                    deletions as well as translocations. Among those 423 clones, 65 clones in which                    a broken CAN1 gene on chromosome V had rearranged with                        LYP1 and/or ALP1, were identified (Table 2). Translocations                    targeting ALP1 on chromosome II were distinguished from those                    targeting ALP1 on chromosome XIV using a PCR primer that                    anneals downstream of ALP1 on chromosome II, but not on                    chromosome XIV. The frequency of all CAN1/LYP1/ALP1                    translocations in HR-1 (15%, 65/423) was similar to that of the                    wildtype strain (13%, 20/150) and C/A and                        C/L/A translocations terminating in chromosome XIV formed                    readily. However, no C/L/A translocations terminating in                        ALP1 on chromosome II were found. This lack of                        C/L/A translocations with chromosome II is not due to                    unavailability of ALP1 on chromosome II as a suitable                    translocation target since C/A translocations involving                        ALP1 on chromosome II were frequent (45/65). Instead, it                    demonstrates that interchromosomal rearrangements between                        LYP1 and ALP1 do not form. To verify this                    finding, a second strain was constructed, HR-2, in which ALP1                    on chromosome II was kept, but the second copy of ALP1 on                    chromosome XIV was deleted so that there was no competition between two                        ALP1 copies (Figure 1, HR-2). Indeed, when we screened chromosome V                    rearrangements in HR-2, no C/L/A translocations were observed                    (0/166). This absence of C/L/A translocations with chromosome                    II suggests that tripartite translocation formation depends on an                    intrachromosomal, secondary rearrangement, such as template-switching between                    similar DNA sequences. Thus, we reasoned that facilitating this intrachromosomal                    rearrangement between LYP1 and ALP1 by                    increasing sequence identity between LYP1 and                        ALP1 should lead to an increase in the formation of                        C/L/A translocations. To test this possibility, seven                    single nucleotides in LYP1 were changed to perfectly match                        ALP1, extending the length of identical sequences between                    the two genes, which range from 5–41 bp in the wildtype genes, to a                    single region of 173 identical base pairs in strain HR-4 (Figure 1). Surprisingly, neither the overall                    GCR rate (1.1×10−7) nor the rate of                        CAN1/LYP1/ALP1                    translocations (9.4×10−9) increased in HR-4 when                    compared to HR-wt (GCR rate: 1.3×10−7,                        CAN1/LYP1/ALP1                    translocation rate: 1.7×10−8). That increasing                    the similarity of LYP1 and ALP1 did not affect                    translocation rates or translocation types suggests that the conversion of                    dicentric C/L translocations into monocentric                        C/L/A translocations may not be the rate-limiting step in                    translocation formation. Instead, the success of the initial translocation                    between CAN1 and LYP1 may determine the                    translocation rate, and experiments are currently underway to test this                    possibility. Finally, we wanted to assess if C/L translocations                    were so rare because they were promptly converted into C/L/A                    translocations or because cells harboring dicentrics could not grow into                    colonies. For this purpose, ALP1 was deleted from the genome                        (Figure 1, HR-3) and GCR                    clones were screened for C/L translocations. That none were                    found suggests that most translocation chromosomes with C/L                    fusions do not survive unless ALP1 is available for a secondary                    rearrangement that converts the dicentric into a monocentric chromosome.
In unmodified cells (HR-wt), CAN1 (blue) is on                            chromosome V and LYP1 (green) and ALP1                            (red) are in opposite orientations on the same arm of chromosome XIV.                            Two copies of ALP1 were present on chromosome XIV and                            II in HR-1, ALP1 was moved from chromosome XIV to II in                            HR-2, ALP1 was deleted in HR-3 and sequence similarity                            between HER-II of ALP1 and LYP1 was                            increased from 96% to 100% in HR-4.
Translocations types C/AchrXIV and                                        C/AchrII refer to                                    C/A translocations terminating in                                    ALP1 on chromosome XIV or II, respectively.                                Translocation types C/L/AchrXIV and                                        C/L/AchrII refer to                                    C/L/A translocations terminating in                                    ALP1 on chromosome XIV or II, respectively.
HR-wt, HR-1, HR-2, HR-3 and HR-4 refer to strains KHSY1530, KHSY2147,                                KHSY2612, KHSY2098, and KHSY3114, respectively. n.a., not                                available.
‘Other’ refers to clones with translocation types                                other than one of three major types of C/A,                                    C/L/A and C/L translocations,                                including clones with multiple translocation type.
The CAN1, LYP1 and ALP1 genes                    share 60–65% overall sequence identity, and we previously                    reported that rearrangements between LYP1 and                        ALP1 more often occurred in longer stretches of identical                    sequences than expected by chance, consistent with a homology-driven,                    Rad52-dependent translocation mechanism [19]. In order to                    determine how the modifications of ALP1 and                        LYP1 had affected breakpoint selection, sites in                        CAN1 and LYP1 where translocations                    originate (donor sites) and sites in LYP1 and                        ALP1 at which translocations are aimed (target sites) were                    amplified and sequenced in all 93 translocation isolated from the unmodified and                    the modified strains. In this study, the term ‘breakpoint’                    is used to describe the sites within the CAN1,                        LYP1 and ALP1 genes at which the                    nucleotide sequence of one gene is fused to the nucleotide sequence of another                    gene; thus the term ‘breakpoint’ most likely refers to the                    sites where recombination events were resolved rather than sites at which the                    initiating DNA lesion occurred. We first identified all sites in                        CAN1 at which translocations originate and found that                    89% of them cluster within two regions, which together span only 283                    bp of the 1773-bp CAN1 gene (Figure 2 A). The first cluster spans 110 bp                    and is hereafter referred to as homeologous region I, HER-I. While                        CAN1 and LYP1 share 83% of                    HER-I sequence, only 63% similarity exists with ALP1                        (Figure 2 E). Moreover,                    the CAN1-LYP1 alignment also shows fewer gaps                    and longer continuous stretches of matching sequences, suggesting that the                    5′ end of LYP1 may be the preferred target for                        CAN1 invasion (Figure S1). The second breakpoint cluster,                    HER-II, was noticed in our previous study. It spans 173 bp, with                        CAN1 sharing 78% of sequence with both                        LYP1 and ALP1, but with                        LYP1 and ALP1 sharing 96% with                    each other (Figure 2 E).                    When sorted by translocation type, it emerged that HER-I facilitates                        C/L/A translocations (Figure 2 C) and HER-II facilitates                        C/A (Figure 2                        B) and C/L translocations (Figure 2 D). Not a single one of the 47                        C/A translocation originated in HER-I, suggesting that the                    63% sequence similarity between the HER-I regions of                        CAN1 and ALP1 is not sufficient for an                    interchromosomal translocation, whereas 83% identity between the                    HER-I regions of CAN1 and LYP1 appears                    sufficient. Taken together, this finding demonstrates that a 110-bp region of                    83% sequence identity and with homology blocks not exceeding 14 bp in                    length is sufficient for Rad52-dependent break-induced replication in yeast                    cells lacking Sgs1 and Mec3, but not in wildtype cells or in the single mutants,                    in which these translocations are not observed.
C/A, C/L/A and C/L                            translocations were sequenced and the last nucleotide of the                                CAN1 gene was mapped to the 1773-bp                                CAN1 gene. (A) The vast majority of                            breakpoints fall within                                Homeologous                                region I (HER-I) or Homeologous region II                            (HER-II), whereas further analysis reveals that (B)                                C/A translocations originate from HER-II, and                                (C) C/L/A translocations originate                            from HER-I of CAN1. (D)                                CAN1 breakpoints of dicentric C/L                            translocations can fall into HER-I or HER-II depending on availability                            of ALP1 for a secondary rearrangement. (E)                            Location and shared sequence identity of the breakpoint clusters HER-I                            and HER-II in CAN1, LYP1 and                                ALP1. HER-I spans 110 bp and shows greater                            similarity between CAN1 and LYP1 than                                ALP1. HER-II spans 173 bp and shows 96%                            sequence identity between LYP1 and                                ALP1 whereas CAN1 shares only                            78% sequence identity with LYP1 and                                ALP1 in that region. HER-I and HER-II are the two                            largest regions of greatest sequence identity present in these three                            genes. Over the entire ORF, CAN1, LYP1                            and ALP1 share 60–65% of their                            sequence. Sequences are shown to scale and are aligned at the HER-I and                            HER-II regions.
Next we asked why some translocations from CAN1 to                        LYP1 undergo a secondary rearrangement with                        ALP1 to form C/L/A translocations whereas                    other translocations from CAN1 to LYP1                    terminate as C/L translocations. We found that the sites in                        CAN1 at which C/L translocations originate                        (Figure 3 A, blue) were                    downstream of sites in CAN1 at which C/L/A                    translocations originate (Figure 3                        A, red), and the LYP1 target sites in                        C/L translocations were downstream of all                        LYP1 target sites in C/L/A translocations                        (Figure 3 B). This                    finding suggests that sequence similarity between LYP1 and                        ALP1 downstream of these C/L breakpoints                    is insufficient for an rearrangement with ALP1. Thus, a                    translocation from CAN1 to LYP1 only results                    in a viable chromosome if the initiating breakpoint in CAN1 is                    located in the HER-I region or at the extreme 5′ end of the HER-II                    region, so that most of the 96% identical HER-II region is available                    for a secondary rearrangement between LYP1 and                        ALP1. Interestingly, we found one translocation that                    originated in CAN1 and targeted HER-I of LYP1                        (Figure 3 A, B, labeled                    *), but failed to go on to become a C/L/A                    translocation, even though the entire HER-II region was available for a                    secondary rearrangement with ALP1. That this                        C/L translocation was identified in the HR-2 strain, in                    which LYP1 and ALP1 were on two different                    chromosomes, demonstrates that translocations from CAN1 to                        LYP1 get stuck in HER-I when ALP1 is not                    available on the same chromosome for a secondary rearrangement. This finding is                    consistent with our conclusion above that secondary rearrangements between                        LYP1 and ALP1 only occur                        intrachromosomally.
(A) Sites in CAN1 at which                                C/L translocations originate (blue) and are located                            downstream of those at which C/L/A translocations                            originate (red). The only exception (labeled *) is a                                C/L translocation in which ALP1                            was not available for an intrachromosomal C/L/A                            rearrangement. Notes that the breakpoint is located within an                                (AG)4 dinucleotide repeat that is susceptible to                            slippage, resulting in a CAN1 donor site that does not                            match the LYP1 target site (labeled ∧)                                (B) Sites in LYP1 targeted by                                C/L translocations (blue) are located downstream of                            those targeted by C/L/A translocations (red).                                (C–D) CAN1 donor sites and                                ALP1 target sites of C/A                            translocations to chromosome XIV match CAN1 donor sites                            and ALP1 target sites of C/A translocations to                            chromosome II originate. (E–F)                                CAN1 donor and LYP1 target sites                            of C/L/A translocations in HR-wt, HR-1 and HR-4 fall                            into the same clusters and match except for the slippage event at the                            first breakpoint (labeled ∧). (G–H)                                LYP1 donor sites match ALP1 target                            sites. Note that all rearrangements between LYP1 and                                ALP1 in HR-4, in which HER-II sequences match                            100%, occur at the same breakpoint (green).
To determine how moving ALP1 to a different chromosome had                    affected breakpoint selection in ALP1, we compared the                    breakpoint target sites in ALP1 on chromosome II with those in                        ALP1 on chromosome XIV. This analysis revealed that the                    chromosomal location of ALP1, while affecting translocation                    type, did not influence target site selection within ALP1 or                    donor site selection within CAN1 (Figure 3 C, D). C/A                    translocations, no matter whether they target chromosome XIV (red) or II (blue),                    originate from nearly identical sets of CAN1 sites. Similarly,                    the sites in ALP1 on chromosome XIV and ALP1                    on chromosome II that are targeted by CAN1 also match. Thus, we                    can conclude that while translocation rates are determined by the chromosomal                    location of the target genes, breakpoint selection is not. This breakpoint                    analysis also revealed that the location of the breakpoints in                        CAN1 exactly predicts the location of the target sites in                        ALP1, as evidenced by the matching patterns of donor sites                    in CAN1 and target sites in ALP1 (Figure 3 C and D). This                    predictability of breakpoint patterns extends to C/L/A                    translocations (Figure 3                        E–H), where donor sites in CAN1 predict                    the target sites in LYP1 (Figure 3 E–F) and donor sites in                        LYP1 predetermine the target sites in ALP1                        (Figure 3                    G–H). However, no connection appears to exist between                        LYP1 sites targeted by CAN1 and                        LYP1 sites serving as a donor for the L/A                    rearrangement. Requirement of the downstream HER-II region in the conversion of                    dicentric C/L translocations to monocentric                        C/L/A translocations indicates 5′ to 3′                    directionality of the recombination process. This directionality is further                    supported by the positive correlation between the length of homology between                        CAN1 and ALP1 as well as between                        CAN1 and LYP1 upstream of the                        C/A and C/L breakpoints, respectively, and                    the number of breakpoints observed at that site, whereas no correlation exists                    for the downstream sequence (Figure                        4). There was only a weak positive correlation between the length of                    homology between LYP1 and ALP1 and the number                    of intrachromosomal L/A rearrangements                    observed at that site (r = 0.38), suggesting                    that the interchromosomal rearrangement is HR-dependent whereas the                    intrachromosomal rearrangement may be HR-independent and/or affected by                    additional constrains.
(A) 5′ homology block length in HER-II of                                CAN1 shows a positive correlation to the number of                                C/A breakpoints at that site, whereas                                (B) 3′ homology block length shows no                            correlation. (C) 5′ homology block length in                            HER-I of CAN1 shows a positive correlation to the                            number of C/L/A translocations originating from that                            site, whereas (D) no correlation is found for 3′                            homology block length. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is                            indicated.
While C/L translocations can be identified by screening with                    primers that anneal to the 5′ and 3′ ends of                        CAN1 and LYP1, respectively, primers that                    anneal to the 5′ and 3′ ends of CAN1 and                        ALP1 amplify both C/A and                        C/L/A translocations, which can only be distinguished by                    sequencing. The simultaneous presence of C/A and                        C/L/A translocations in the same clone is indicated by                    double peaks in the sequencing chromatogram at sites where the homeologous                    regions in ALP1 and LYP1 differ. The                    identification of such clones (included in ‘Other’ in Table 2) that harbor                    multiple types of translocation between CAN1,                        LYP1 and ALP1 (Figure 5 A) indicates instability of                    translocation chromosomes. To test this possibility, clone 1095 harboring                        C/L, C/A and C/L/A                    translocations was streaked on agar for single colonies with the expectation                    that we would obtain the three translocations in individual colonies if the                    translocations were stable. The colonies that were obtained after 3 days of                    growth were heterogeneous, ranging from tiny to large with round or irregular                    edges. Of 40 single colonies that were analyzed, 25 contained single                    translocations that were identical to those found in the original clone. Among                    the other 15 single colonies, however, three novel translocations with                    breakpoints not seen in the original clone were identified as well as six new                    combinations of new and old translocations. Thus, instead of the expected three                    translocations, a total of six different translocations in nine different                    combinations were identified (Figure 5 B). Since all 40 colonies were derived from single cells,                    the identification of single colonies with multiple (old and new) translocations                    in several combinations indicates that at least one of the original                    translocations is unstable. The obligatory presence of the original                        C/L translocation in all colonies with multiple new and old                    translocations suggests that the dicentric C/L chromosome is                    unstable and subjected to cycles of rearrangement that lead to new                    translocations. In addition to clone 1095, evidence that C/L                    and C/L/A translocations present in the same clone may be                    derived from each other was also found in heterogeneous clone 1063, in which                    sequencing revealed that all translocations shared the same                        CAN1 breakpoint at nucleotide 800 of CAN1.                    Continued instability of chromosome V after having rearranged with                        LYP1 to form a dicentric C/L translocation                    is detectable by array-based comparative genome hybridization (array CGH) (Figure 5 C). The two clones                    with single C/L translocations analyzed here were obtained from                        sgs1Δ mutants with defects in the DNA damage                    checkpoint clamp (mec3Δ) or clamp loading                        (rad24Δ), which had previously been shown to yield                        C/L translocations [19]. While CGH on both                    clones showed that loss of chromosome V sequence is most noticeable distal of                    the CAN1 breakpoint (due to loss of this region in the original                        C/L translocation and hence its absence in all its                    derivatives), it also revealed further degradation beyond the                        CAN1 locus, indicating ongoing instability.
(A) Double peaks in the chromatogram indicate presence of                                C/A and C/L/A translocations in                            the same clone. Seven single nucleotide differences, indicated in red,                            distinguish the HER-II regions of ALP1 and                                LYP1. (B) Translocations in forty                            single colonies derived from unstable clone 1095 were characterized. The                            locations of CAN1 (black), LYP1                            (green), ALP1 (red) in the parental strain are shown on                            the left; multiple translocations identified in clone 1095 are shown in                            the column “original clone”; nine different                            combinations (bottom row) of six different translocations (types                            1–6) in the forty single colonies are schematically depicted                            in the right column. The three translocation types indentified in the                            original clone are named type 1, type 2 and type 3, indicated below the                            column as [1], [2], [3]. Three translocations with new                            breakpoints were observed, named “4”,                            “5” and “6”. The mixture of                            various translocations indentified in each clone is indicated in                            brackets below each column, and the number of clones with a particular                            translocation mixture is indicated at the bottom of each column.                                (C) aCGH reveals chromosome end degradation in two                            clones with single C/L dicentrics. Clones 608 (top) and                            349J (bottom) were isolated from sgs1Δ                                mec3Δ and sgs1Δ                                rad24Δ mutants, respectively. The original                                CAN1 breakpoint is indicated by a vertical                            line.
Identical CAN1 breakpoints shared by multiple translocations in                    heterogeneous clones were suggestive of a common origin of the various                    translocations. Thus, we analyzed the DNA sequences downstream of                        CAN1 breakpoints in heterogeneous clones for additional                    shared features. Indeed, in heterogeneous clone 1063 an A879T substitution was                    identified in the C/L translocation 12 nucleotides downstream                    of the C/L breakpoint (Figure 6 A). Since translocations between                        CAN1, LYP1 and ALP1 are                    nonreciprocal, as indicated by the presence of intact LYP1 and                        ALP1 genes on chromosome XIV, analysis of the wildtype                        LYP1 gene was possible in this clone. Sequencing revealed                    that the A879T mutation was not present in the intact LYP1 gene                    of this clone, suggesting that the mutation occurred during translocation from                        CAN1 to LYP1. This A879T substitution                    could have resulted either from a polymerase error or from CAN1                    invading and copying the nearby ALP1 locus (which contains a T                    at this location) prior to forming the C/L translocation (Figure 6 B). Upstream of this                    A/T mismatch LYP1 and ALP1 share 41 bp of                    perfect sequence identity, which could have stabilized such a transient                    template-switch. If the C/L/A translocation in the same clone                    was indeed derived from this C/L translocation, as already                    suggested by their common CAN1 breakpoint, the base                    substitution should also be present. That sequencing of the                        C/L/A translocation indeed identified the same base                    substitution suggests that these two translocations are derived from each other                    instead of arising independently from separate CAN1 invasions.                    A T521C substitution 21 nucleotides downstream of the C/A                    breakpoint was found in the C/A translocation of a another                    clone (1840), but not in the intact ALP1 gene of that clone                        (Figure 6 C). However,                    since T, not C, is found at the corresponding positions in                    CAN1, LYP1 and ALP1, and a                    BLAST search of the yeast genome revealed no locus with extensive sequence                    identity to ALP1 surrounding the T/C mismatch, the T521C base                    substitution is likely to be the result of a polymerase error during early                    BIR.
(A) An A879T change was observed in the C/L                            and C/L/A translocations of clone 1063, but not in                                LYP1 of the intact chromosome XIV of that clone,                            suggesting it arose during translocation formation and                                C/L/A is derived from C/L.                                (B) Formation of the A879T change by template switching                            from LYP1 to ALP1 and back to                                LYP1. (C) A T521C change in the                                C/A translocation of clone 1840 was not present in                                ALP1 on the intact chromosome XIV in the same                            clone. T521C may have resulted from a replication error or template                            switching to a locus other than ALP1,                                LYP1 or CAN1 since none of them                            contains a C at this location (D) Alignment of HER-I of                                CAN1 and LYP1, indicating seven                            breakpoints at which CAN1 and LYP1                            recombine. Except for breakpoint 1, all are followed by a single                            mismatch. The (AG)4 repeats in CAN1 and                                LYP1 are indicated in red and green, respectively.                                (E–G) Looping out of a single AG unit leads                            to a longer perfect match between CAN1 and                                LYP1, and could explain why breakpoints 1 and 2 can                            be found fused to 5′-CCTT sequence of                            LYP1.
In addition to base substitutions, we detected possible evidence of DNA slippage                        (Figure 6                    D–G). With a single exception, the CAN1                    sequence in C/L and C/L/A translocations                    terminates at single base-pair mismatches within HER-I (Figure 6 D, breakpoints 2–7).                    Termination at breakpoint 1, which is not followed by a mismatch (Figure 6 D, breakpoint 1) was                    observed in one C/L/A translocation and could be explained by                    DNA slippage within a short AG repeat during strand invasion. Specifically,                    slippage of the (AG)4 repeat in CAN1 during                    annealing to the corresponding (AG)3 repeat in LYP1                    may have led to looping out of a single repeat unit in CAN1                        (Figure 6 F) or, more                    likely, a shift in base pairing (Figure 6 G). As a result, a mismatched base may sometimes be located                    after (AG)4 or after (AG)3, thus making both sites                    susceptible to becoming CAN1 translocation donor sites. The                    increase in length of the base-paired region from six to ten matches as a result                    of this slippage event may have promoted termination of the                        CAN1 sequence at breakpoint 1.
Although some RecQ-like helicases have been successfully purified so that their                substrate specificity and enzymatic function could be determined in                    vitro, less is known about the mechanism by which RecQ-like DNA                helicases preserve genome integrity or about the types of genome rearrangements that                arise in cells lacking RecQ-like DNA helicases. In an ongoing effort to shed light                on these questions, we previously showed that yeast double mutants lacking the                RecQ-like helicase Sgs1 in addition to certain DNA damage checkpoint components                (Mec3, Rad24, Tel1) accumulate recurring, Rad52-dependent, Rad51-independent                translocations between the related CAN1, LYP1 and                    ALP1 genes [19]. Simple C/A and                    C/L translocations, but also more complex                    C/L/A rearrangements were found in these mutants, and the aim                of the current study was to test models for the formation of these translocations,                and to gain additional insight into the general mechanism of translocation                formation. One possibility for C/L/A translocation formation was                that they arise in a single event, in which CAN1 invades                    LYP1, but dissociates and reanneals to the nearby                    ALP1. Alternatively, C/L/A translocations                could form as a result of two independent events; in the first event                    CAN1 translocates to LYP1 and forms a                dicentric C/L chromosome, and in the second event, possibly during                anaphase of mitosis, this C/L dicentric breaks and invades                    ALP1 to form a monocentric C/L/A                translocation. Interestingly, the inability to form C/L/A                translocations if all three genes are located on three different chromosomes and the                observation of clonal instability point to the following two sources for                    C/L/A translocations. Translocation formation is initiated by a                DNA break on chromosome V that leads to invasion of LYP1 on                chromosome XIV, using the sequence homology provided by the HER-I sequence in                    CAN1 and LYP1. This HER-I-mediated invasion of                    LYP1 by CAN1 leads to initiation of DNA                synthesis on chromosome XIV, which may then be subjected to dissociation and                re-invasion cycles as previously described [6]. If the re-invading                strand mistakenly anneals to the nearby ALP1, this time utilizing                the 96%-identical HER-II sequence for an                intrachromosomal template-switching event, a monocentric                    C/L/A translocation forms. If re-invasion occurs at the same                site in LYP1 or BIR simply continues without dissociation, a                dicentric C/L chromosome forms. This dicentric provides the second                source for C/L/A translocation formation as it is likely to be                susceptible to breakage in mitosis followed by renewed attempts at repair. This                ongoing instability of dicentrics is supported by our finding of intraclonal                heterogeneity of translocation types. Broken C/L dicentrics are                likely to utilize LYP1 sequence contained in them to reinvade                chromosome XIV at LYP1, forming either a another unstable dicentric                or giving rise to a stable, monocentric C/L/A chromosome by                undergoing an intrachromosomal template-switch to ALP1. Repeated                cycles of breakage and repair of C/L dicentrics are the likely                explanation for presence of multiple, different translocations in the same clone and                continued formation of new gene fusions in our study.
Thus, while recombination between HER-I sequences of CAN1 and                    LYP1 leads to dicentrics that provide a source for                    C/L/A translocations, it appears that annealing of                    CAN1 with HER-II of LYP1 leads to                    C/L dicentrics that disappear from the population because they                are unable to undergo a stabilizing rearrangement with ALP1 due to                lack of downstream homology. In some cases, seemingly stable C/L                translocations with breakpoints in HER-II could be obtained (Figure 3 A and B). In these cases it is likely                that they underwent conversion to a monocentric chromosome, using chromosome XIV                sequences other than ALP1, without disrupting the                    C/L fusion. In other cases, C/L translocations                were found to be highly unstable, giving rise to new translocations. Although                unstable C/L translocations were formed by annealing HER-II of                    CAN1 and LYP1, the CAN1                breakpoints were located at the very 5′ end of HER-II, leaving almost all                of HER-II available for rearrangements with ALP1 and formation of                stable C/L/A translocations. Further evidence that                    C/L/A translocations and can be derived from unstable C/L                dicentrics is provided by identical CAN1 breakpoints and the                occurrence of single-nucleotide changes shared by multiple translocations in the                same clone. Such base substitutions near translocation breakpoints may result from                replication errors or re-invasion at similar sequences and could, combined with the                potential for frameshifts due to slippage at the gene fusion site, be a source for                mutations and loss of gene function even if recombination occurs between allelic                sequences on sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes. These                recombination-associated errors were rare, occurring in three of the 573                translocations between CAN1, LYP1 and                    ALP1 in HR-wt and HR-1 (0.005%).
Intrachromosomal, faulty template-switching between inverted repeats was recently                also proposed in a study by Paek et al                [35] to                account for the formation of dicentric chromosomes in budding yeast, which, similar                to the dicentrics in our study, proved to be unstable and substrates for further                chromosomal rearrangements. These authors also reported that                intrachromosomal template-switching is Rad52-independent, which                could suggest that the Rad52-dependence of the CAN1/LYP1/ALP1                translocations studied here is due to the interchromosomal recombination event                between CAN1 and LYP1 or CAN1 and                    ALP1, whereas intrachromosomal template                switching between LYP1 and ALP1 may be                Rad52-independent. Indeed, the weaker correlation between 5′ homology                block length and the number of L/A breakpoints observed at that                site compared to that for C/L or C/A breakpoints                suggests that additional factors affect template switching and may suggest a lesser                role (or no role) for HR in the intrachromosomal template-switch                between LYP1 and ALP1.
That translocations between CAN1, LYP1 and                    ALP1 form so frequently in cells lacking Sgs1 and a DNA damage                sensor such as Mec3, but not in the single mutants, most likely stems from the                independent roles of these factors in preventing different intermediates of                translocation formation, such that in the double mutants increased lesion formation,                aberrant lesion processing, greater tolerance for dicentrics and/or the products of                their breakage and defective checkpoint activation combine to create conditions                suitable for translocation formation. That C/L dicentrics are                unstable and give rise to multiple new rearrangements suggests that dicentrics break                during anaphase to fuse again, entering a cycle of repeated breakage and fusion                until a stable translocation chromosome is generated, if ever. This process may be                comparable to the futile breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle observed in                multicellular eukaryotes. In cancers where intratumor heterogeneity is common, such                as osteosarcoma, a positive correlation has been observed between the number of                dicentrics and the frequency of BFBs, which are thought to be a source of mitotic                chromosome instability and may in some cases generate complex rearrangements                involving multiple chromosomes [36]. Interestingly, increased presence of                micronuclei, which are thought to contain chromosome fragments that have resulted                from breakage of unresolved BFBs, has been reported for cells from Bloom's                syndrome patients and from BLM knock-out mice [37], [38]. Indeed, the Hickson                laboratory recently showed that BLM localizes to BFBs and to novel ultrafine bridges                (UFBs), the latter of which commonly emerge from centromeric regions in normal cells                    [39],                    [40],                    [41].                BFBs and UFBs accumulate in BLM-defective cells, and the authors                found evidence that BLM is required for efficient and proper resolution of bridge                structures, most likely by decatenation, rather than the prevention of bridge                formation prior to anaphase [40], [41]. Thus, lack of BLM, or Sgs1 in yeast, may                contribute to increased chromosome breakage and occasional large-scale                rearrangements and DNA loss. Combining the lack of Sgs1/BLM with dysfunctional                Tel1/ATM or Mec3/9-1-1 checkpoint pathways creates conditions under which mitotic                chromosome breaks may not be efficiently detected and/or faithfully processed,                allowing recurring, complex translocations and unstable dicentrics to arise and                persist [19]. DNA lesions that give rise to translocations may                be present at increased rates in cells lacking Sgs1, as Sgs1 has been shown to also                have roles in the processing of DSBs [26], the resolution of                unusual secondary DNA structures, such as G4 tetrads [42], [43], resolution of                recombination intermediates [22] and possibly in checkpoint activation itself                    [44]. Here, we have provided evidence how this                increased genome instability can lead to the formation of complex translocations by                intragenic, interchromosomal BIR that requires as little as 110 bp of 83%                identity with homology blocks that do not exceed 14 bp, and by intrachromosomal                template-switching that requires as little as 173 bp of 96% identity                separated by 2445 bp. In addition, dicentric chromosomes are a source of                intraclonal, and most likely intratumor, heterogeneity, giving rise to not only                translocations with new breakpoints, but also cells with new combinations of these                chromosome rearrangements. In Bloom's syndrome and other human chromosome                instability syndromes such ongoing genome instability is likely to contribute to                increased cancer incidence at an earlier age and other characteristic signs of                premature aging.
