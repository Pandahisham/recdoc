Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the ability of history taking alone, compared withpregnancy testing, to identify early pregnancies among potential female measles vaccinees.
Methods: As part of an institution-wide measles immunization program, 326 female health careworkers (HCWs) who denied being pregnant underwent a urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination.
Results: Of the 326 women, 3 had positive pregnancy tests and were ultimately confirmed to bepregnant. Although all 3 women denied the possibility of pregnancy prior to testing, 2 had beenunable to give an exact date for their last menstrual period (LMP).
Conclusions: In this group of 326 northern New England HCWs being immunized against measlesduring an outbreak, history taking alone failed to identify 3 pregnancies. If the inability to give anexact date of the LMP had been included as a discriminator, 2 additional pregnancies could havebeen suspected, but 1 pregnancy still would have gone undetected.
