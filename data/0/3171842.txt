Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of alopecia in men and women. Among women, approximately 6% to 38% experience some degree of frontal/frontoparietal hair loss. At present, the only clinically validated medication approved for increasing hair density in women with AGA is minoxidil topical solution (MTS), mostly 2% product but up to 5% in several countries. Recently a 5% minoxidil topical foam (MTF) twice daily was shown to be safe and effective in men using an aesthetically pleasing foam vehicle. We conducted a randomized, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of once-daily 5% MTF (50mg/day) versus twice-daily 2% MTS (40mg/day) in women with AGA. 113 women with AGA were randomized to 24 weeks of treatment with 5% MTF or 2% MTS. The primary efficacy parameter was change from baseline in nonvellus target area hair count (TAHC) at week 24. Secondary end points included change in nonvellus target area hair width (TAHW), overall efficacy by global photographic review (GPR), adverse events, and subjects′ assessment of product aesthetics. After 24 weeks, women randomized to 5% MTF once daily showed non-inferior TAHC and TAHW and experienced greater, but non-significant, improvements in TAHC, TAHW, and overall efficacy by GPR than those randomized to 2% MTS twice daily. 5% MTF was significantly superior to 2% MTS in subjects′ agreement with “the treatment does not interfere with styling my hair” (P=.001). Once-daily 5% MTF is non-inferior and as effective for stimulating hair growth as twice-daily 2% MTS in women with AGA and is associated with several aesthetic and practical advantages.
