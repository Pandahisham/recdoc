PRESENCE OF TWO TYPES OF L POLYPEPTIDE CHAINS IN GUINEA PIG 7S IMMUNOGLOBULINS

 Guinea pig 7S immunoglobulins (γ1 and γ2) consist of two groups of molecules (K and L) bearing different types of L chains (κ and λ). Approximately one-third of the molecules in normal guinea pig γ2-globulin bear the λ- type of L chains, and all or most of the others bear κ-chains. κ- and λ-chains have similar molecular weights.
