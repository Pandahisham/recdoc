Advances in imaging techniques (CT and MRI) and widespread use of imaging especially ultrasound scanning have resulted in a dramatic increase in the detection of small renal masses. While open partial nephrectomy is still the reference standard for the management of these small renal masses, its associated morbidity has encouraged clinicians to exploit the advancements in minimally invasive ablative techniques. The last decade has seen the rapid development of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and novel ablative techniques such as, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and cryoablation (CA). In particular, CA for small renal masses has gained popularity as it combines nephron-sparing surgery with a minimally invasive approach. Studies with up to 5-year followup have shown an overall and cancer-specific 5-year survival of 82% and 100%, respectively. This manuscript will focus on the principles and clinical applications of cryoablation of small renal masses, with detailed review of relevant literature.

Worldwide, around208 500 new cases of renal cancer are diagnosed each year, accounting for justunder a 2% of all cancers with higher incidence in more developed countries [1–3]. Regardlessof its true impact on annual incidence, the widespread use of more sensitiveimaging techniques (USS, CT, and MRI) has led to an increase in the number ofincidentally detected renal tumors [4–7], with an estimated increased detection of asymptomatic, small renalmasses by 60% in recent years [8].
In Europe, themost recent estimates of incidence of renal cancer suggest that there are 63 300new cases annually in the EU25, accounting for nearly 3% of all cancers [9], with an estimated annual increase in incidence of approximately 2%[2, 10]. In Spain, the estimatedincidence and mortality for the year 2002 were 4085 (2778 men, 1307 women) and1644 (1093 men, 551 women) cases, respectively (FCAECC, La situacion del canceren España. Ministerio de Sanidad, 2005).
In contrast to ahistorical incidence of 5% of renal tumours of less than 3 cm in size, currentincidence of such tumours ranges between 10% and 40% [11, 12]. Although the naturalhistory and biological behaviour of this “small renal mass” are yet to beunderstood, the available evidence demonstrates a rather slow growth of  these small masses, with an annual sizeincrease not greater of 0.5 cm [13–17]. Furthermore, between 15% and 30% of small renal tumours areconfirmed to be benign or to have a low grade and low-malignant potential on pathologicalexamination [18–21].
As a result,urologists now face a subset of early-stage asymptomatic patients withclinical, pathological, and morbid characteristics clearly different from thosewith a classically presented renal malignancy. The management of this group ofpatients, while still controversial, has evolved dramatically in recent years.Conservative approach by means of active monitoring or watchful waiting hasbeen advocated by some authors [14, 22–24], and is a feasibleoption particularly in the elderly and significantly comorbid patient. Surgery,however, is the preferred management option for the younger, healthier patient.In recent years, nephron-sparing surgery (open and laparoscopic partialnephrectomy) has become the standard treatment for small renal masses, withdata available from large series confirming similar 5-year cancer-specificsurvival rates (90%–100%) and a lowrisk (0%–3%) of localrecurrence [25–29]. Although laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has clear advantagesover the open approach, particularly on wound-related morbidity, its technicaldifficulty has limited its widespread use. Consequently, laparoscopic andpercutaneous ablative techniques in renal surgery, such as, radio frequencyablation (RFA), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), and cryoablation (CA)are being increasingly utilized as they offer parenchymal preservation alongwith less morbidity. Although long-term oncological data is currently notavailable, present 5-year followup data is very encouraging. This article willfocus on cryoablation (CA) of small renal masses and in particular, onlaparoscopic cryoablation (LCA), with an up-to-date review of the availableliterature and detailed analysis of the largest published series.
Cryoablation hasbeen used in medicine since James Arnott, back in 1845–1851, demonstratedthat freezing temperatures could be applied to cause tissue destruction [30]. Further interests in this field with improved delivery system andunderstanding of freeze-thaw sequence were followed by the use of CA in thetreatment of prostate cancer only to be abandoned because of localcomplications [31–34].
Atthe turn of the last century, driven by the need for minimally invasivetechniques and facilitated by rapid technological developments, a renewedinterest on cryoablation and its applications in urological oncologyre-emerged. Experience with vacuum-insulated liquid nitrogen or argon-cooled probesin other disciplines and technological advantages in intraoperative imaging [35], laparoscopic USS probes in particular, has allowed a safe andefficient targeting of kidney tumours. As a result, renal cryoablation, eitherpercutaneous or laparoscopic, has become a feasible and exciting new minimallyinvasive surgical option for the treatment of small masses.
Cryoablation causes tissuedestruction by a direct, as well as by a vascular, delayed mechanism [36, 37]. Direct cell damage begins with fallingtemperatures as structural/functional cell components are stressed and cellmetabolism progressively fails. With freezing, ice crystal formation firstoccurs in the extracellular space, creating a hyperosmotic environment whichdraws water from the cells and, by a “solution-effect injury,” causes cellshrinkage and membrane damage. With further cooling, especially at high coolingrates, ice crystals will form within the cell. This phenomenon, possiblyfacilitated by cell-to-cell propagation via intercellular channels [38],is almost always lethal to the cell. While some cells will contain ice crystalsat temperatures as high as −15°C,certainty of intracellular ice formation requires temperatures below −40°C(homogeneous nucleation) [37, 39]. During thawing, with temperatures above −40°C, ice crystals fuse into larger crystals (“recrystallization”) which, together with a transient hypotonicextracellular environment that draws water back into the cell, will result infurther damage of the cell membrane and membrane rupture.
Indirectly, hypoxic damage occursas a result of microvascular stasis. With lowering temperatures, initialvasoconstriction produces a decrease in blood flow, with complete cessationduring freezing. During thawing, the circulation returns with transientvasodilatation. Endothelial damage produces increased permeability, oedema,platelet aggregation, and formation of thrombi, resulting in a sustainedmicrovascular occlusion and stagnation [40, 41].
Whiledownregulation of tumour suppressor genes essential to the control of apoptosishas been implicated in most malignancies and proapoptotic factors such ashypothermia, ischaemia, inflammation, elevated calcium levels, immunologic-basedmechanisms including macrophage recruitment are associated with freezinginjury. Recent studies implicate gene regulated cell death (apoptosis) incryosurgical outcomes [42, 43].
The histological end result is aconfluent coagulative necrosis, as evidenced by thepresence of numerous histiocytes, cholesterol crystals, and dystrophiccalcification within thecryolesion, with eventual fibrosis and scarring. Features that have beendemonstrated in animal models [44, 45] as well as in human renal cryoablated tumours[46, 47].
Renal cryoablation has been shownto produce predictable and reproducible tissue destruction in animal models [48–53]. Cell damage depends on the cooling rate,the number of freeze-thaw cycles [45], the lowest temperatures achieved as wellas the hold time at subzero temperatures [37, 54]. Importantly,while temperature below −19.4°C has been shown to be sufficient for completedestruction of normal renal parenchyma [48], neoplastic cells may require temperaturesas low as −50°C  to guarantee cell death [37]. Moreover, preclinical models havedemonstrated that such low temperatures can only be achieved within a corevolume of tissue, limited to 4 to 6 mm inside the edge of the forming ice ball [48, 49]. Thus, most authors will extend the ice ballto 1 cm beyond the tumour margins, incorporating the outer few millimetres or“indeterminate zone” and a margin of normal renal parenchyma, to optimizeoncological control [55].
Modern cryoprobes can achievetemperatures as low as −190°C by exploiting the Joule-Thompson effect.Typically, compressed argon gas is allowed to expand through a small orifice,producing temperatures well below those required to ablate normal renal tissue (−19.4°C)[48] and cancer cells (−40°C), asdemonstrated on in vivoprostatic [56] and renal cryolesions [45]. Although, the number of cycles is stillcontroversial, early data from in vivo experiments [37] has now been corroborated in cryoablatedtumours. With the incorporation of double-freeze cycles, a larger cryolesioncan be achieved than with a single cycle. Apart of the number of cycles and incontrast to original experimental observations, it has been demonstrated thatrapid thawing, with helium gas at 15°C to 20°C/min, does not infringe onlesion size, while reducing procedural time [45].
Following thefirst experimental renal cryosurgery by Lutzeyer et al. [57, 58], it was not until 1995that Uchida et al. performed the first reported percutaneouscryoablation in canine kidneys and, later that year, reproduced the techniquein 2 patients with advanced renal carcinoma [59]. CA has developed rapidly since and can currently be delivered viaopen, laparoscopic and percutaneous approaches.
Feasibility of openrenal cryotherapy in humans was first reported in 1996 by Delworth et al., atthe University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, after a successfultreatment of two patients with tumours in a solitary kidney, one renal cellcarcinoma and one angiomyolipoma [60]. Rukstalis et al. published in 2001 the first report on systematicuse of this approach [61]. A total of 29 tumours (22 solid masses and 7 complex cysts) with amedian size of 2.2 cm were treated using intraoperative ultrasound monitoring anddouble-freeze sequences. With a median followup of 16 months, only one patienthad a biopsy-confirmed recurrent tumour. Five serious adverse events occurredin 5 patients, with only one event directly related to the procedure. Overall,91.3% of patients demonstrated a complete radiographic response [61]. In 2002, Khorsandi et al. reported open cryoablation on 17patients with small  renal tumours(median 2 cm; range: 1.1–4.2 cm), using adouble freeze-thaw technique to −180°C. Median age was 62 years (range: 35–75 years). With amedian followup of 30 months (range: 10–60 months), MRIdemonstrated infarction and a reduction of lesion size in 15 of 16 cases. Onepatient's mass was unchanged at 3 months followup [62].
Whilst open CA offers safe parenchymal preservation, woundmorbidity appears to be the drawback of this technique. With only two furtherreports in the literature [63, 64], practice in recentyears has clearly favoured the laparoscopic and percutaneous approaches, with amarked trend towards the former.
Laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) offers several proceduraladvantages, namely, a minimally invasive approach, magnification, directvisualization of the tumour and internal manipulation of the cryoprobes anddual (visual and ultrasound) monitoring of the cryolesion [65] as well as allowing extensive pathologic sampling [66]. Surgeon preference and experience are crucial for choosing betweentransperitoneal and retroperineoscopic approaches. Whiletransperitoneal approach allows a more direct access to anterior tumours, itcarries a higher risk of bowel injury. Posteriorly located tumours are moreamenable to retroperineoscopy, however, blunt dissection in this approach isassociated with an increased risk of bleeding [12].
In our experience at Sunderland Royal Hospital, from September 2005,17 patients have undergone LCA under a strict departmental protocol. Patient ispositioned in lateral position as for nephrectomy. We used one 10 mm port forcamera and two working ports (10 and 5 mm). Depending on the position of thetumour, we have used a further 5 mm port to retract the liver. Followingadequate pneumoperitoneum, kidney is mobilised in order to access the tumourfavourably for the needle insertion and for ultrasound probe positioning.Gerota's fascia and peri-renal fat are carefully dissected to expose thetumour. A standard biopsy of the tumour is then performed. Cryoprobes (17G) are inserted under visual and ultrasound control(Figure 1), at a maximum distance of 1 cm apart from each other. Tumour core temperature and tumour margin temperatureare monitored throughout. Our protocol includes 2 Freeze-Thaw cycles: Freezing,during 10 minutes, achieving a core temperature of −70°C and a peripheraltemperature of at least −40°C, followed by of 10 minutes of thawing (5 minutesactive + 5 minutes passive thawing). The ice-ball is monitored visually by thesurgeon and by real-time laparoscopic USS probe (Hitachi) performed by anexpert consultant uroradiologist (Figure 2). The ice-ball is extended to a minimum of 5 mmbeyond the tumour margins. Following surgery, our preferred imaging modality ispre- and postcontrast CT, which is performed as part of our followup protocolat 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and yearly thereafter. Renal function is checked at eachclinic visit. Since majority of recurrences are found at 3 months and almostall at 1 year, CT or MRI at 3, 6, 12 months and yearly thereafter has beenrecommended by other authors [67].
No treatment failureshave been so far observed. Twelve masses (70%) were demonstrated to be a RCC.Histology in one patient revealed urothelial carcinoma necessitatingnephroureterectomy. One patient required transfusion and another underwentembolisation of an arterio-venous fistula.
A comprehensive review ofthe literature reveals promising results. A summary of outcomes for the largerseries is summarised in Table 1.
In 2003, Lee et al. reportedresults of LCA with ultrasound guidance, double-freeze cycle and up to 3-yearsfollowup (mean 20.25 months), in 20 patients with small renal masses (1.4–4.5 cm) and ageranging from 43 to 84 years. Mean operating time was 305.9 minutes and bloodloss 92.5 mL (50–200 mL). Biopsiesdemonstrated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 11 cases, none of which had recurred. Overall survival was 100% for this cohort [68].
Inthe same year, Nadler et al.reported results on 15 patients. Mean age was 68.5years (range: 49–86 years). Meantumour size was 2.15 cm (range: 1.2–3.2 cm), and meanestimated blood loss was 67 mL (range: 15–125 mL). RCC wasdemonstrated in 10 cases. Median radiographic followup (15 months, range 4.9–27 months)revealed stable lesions in all patients. There was 1 treatment failure due toincomplete treatment of the periphery of the lesion. Another patient, with asuccessfully treated tumour, had a positive followup biopsy due to multifocalpapillary renal cell carcinoma and required nephrectomy [69].
Initial data from theSouthern Illinois University was published in 2005, a total of 25 patients withan average age of 65 years (range: 32–83 years) andmean tumour size of 2.4 cm (range: 1.5–3.6 cm).  Pathology revealed RCC in 72% of cases. Witha followup for up to 36 months (range: 6–36 months), norecurrences were reported [70]. Subsequent publication including 84 consecutive patients with an average age of 67 years and a mean tumour size of 2.6 cm (range: 1.2-4.7 cm) of which, 70 procedures were performed laparoscopically. They reported 7 conversions, 2 of them for failures. Intraoperative biopsy yielded a 59% malignancy rate. With a mean followupof 10 months (range: 3–36 months), an abnormal postoperative enhancement occurred in 2 patients, one of which was confirmed to be a RCC [71].
Cestari et al. presented data from a cohortof 70 patients treated with laparoscopic (48 transperitoneal, 28retroperineoscopic) cryoablation (LCA). Average age was 63.2 years, mean size2.37 cm (range: 1–6 cm), mean operating time and blood loss were 181.4 minutesand 164.2 mL, respectively. With a followup of up to 36 months, progressivereduction of the cryolesion was demonstrated in all patients on MRI. Only 1patient required radical nephrectomy for recurrent tumour [72].
In 2005, with 168 cases performed at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation(1997–2005), Hegarty et al. reported, prospectivelycollected, intermediate-term (3 years) followup data in 56 patients, with amean tumour size of 2.3 cm, who underwent LCA under a strict MRI imaging andCT-guided biopsy followup protocol, introduced in 1997. Sequential meancryolesion size on MRI on postoperative 1 day, at 3 and 6 months, and at 1, 2,and 3 years was 3.7, 2.8, 2.3, 1.7, 1.2, and 0.9 cm, representing a 26%, 39%,56%, 69%, and 75% reduction in cryolesion size at 3 and 6 months and 1, 2, and3 years, respectively. At 3 years, 17 cryolesions (38%) had completelydisappeared on MRI. Postoperative needle biopsy identified locallypersistent/recurrent renal tumour in 2 patients. In the 51 patients undergoingcryotherapy for a unilateral, sporadic renal tumour 3-year cancer specificsurvival was 98%. There was no open conversion. During the 2006 AUA Meeting,this group presented updated results on 60 patients that had each completed 5years followup (median 72 months). Mean tumour size was 2.3 cm (range 1–4.5 cm). Three patients(6.7%) developed local recurrence. Overall and cancer-specific 5-year survivalwas 82% and 100%, respectively [73].
Moon et al. published results on 16 patients withsmall renal masses (mean size 2.6 cm), and their mean operating time was 188minutes. There was 1 reported conversion, and mean blood loss was 40 mL. Tumourbiopsy demonstrated 5 RCC. With a mean followup of 9.6 months, all tumoursremained nonenhancing and either stable or smaller than the original lesion [74]. This group has recently reportedcombined data from its 5-year experience with renal cryoablation on 88 cases,treated by LCA [58] or PCA [20]. Mean tumour size was 2.6 cm. At a mean followupof 19 months, the overall, cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival rateswere 88.5%, 100%, and 98.7%, respectively. Four patients required a furthertreatment due to persistent disease, and one had progression to locallyadvanced disease [75].
In 2007 Polascik et al. published results from hisexperience in 26 patients who underwent LCA using third-generationcryotechnology, for 28 renal masses of 3.5 cm or less (median 2 cm). Patientswere followed by serial CT or MRI scan, at least every six months aftercryoablation. The mean patient age was 64 years (range: 44–79), and the meanfollowup was 20.9 months. The median tumour size was 2.0 cm (range: 1–3.5 cm). Nopatient was converted to open surgery. With an overall survival rate of 100%,no evidence of recurrence or progression was found in this cohort [76].
With 47 cases in their series, Beemster et al., from the University of Amsterdam group, have nowpublished data on 26 patients with available followup of 6 months or more. Withan average followup of 17.2 months (range: 6–36 months) and amean tumour size of 2.4 cm (range: 1.3–3.8 cm), only 1treatment failure has been reported [77].
In agreement with data generated by larger series, preliminaryresults from smaller series have recently been published [78–81]. Although comprising smallernumber of patients and limited followup in some cases, the published seriesclearly demonstrate the increasing interest and rapid expansion of this novelablative technique.
Whiletechnical limitations hampered initial attempts at percutaneous cryoablation inhuman kidneys [59], therapid development of argon technology and ultrathin probes, together with CTand open access interventional MRI, allowing real-time monitoring of the iceball, provided the much needed technical breakthroughs, making this approachsafe and reproducible.
In2001, Shingleton and Sewell [82] reportedtheir initial experience in 20 patients (22 tumours) treated with 2 or 3 mmcryoprobes and interventional MRI. Mean tumour size was 3 cm (range: 1.8–7 cm), and averagetreatment time was 97 minutes (range: 56–172 minutes).Procedures were performed under general anaesthesia or sedation, and 95% ofpatients were discharged within 24 hours. With a mean followup of 9.1 months(range: 3–14 months), theyreported only one failure, requiring retreatment. The only complication was asuperficial wound abscess. Recently, the authors have updated their seriesincluding patients with von Hipple-Lindau [83] and withtumour/s in a solitary kidney [84]. With anaverage followup of 24 months, 9 (15%) cases required retreatment due to incompleteinitial ablation. Only 1 patient required transfusion, and there were noreported cancer-related deaths.
Experience on 23 patients (26 tumours) with mean size 2.6 cm (range:1–4.6 cm) and meanage of 66 years (range: 43–86 years) wasreported by Silverman et al., using a 0.5-T open MR imaging system and generalanesthesia. Twenty four masses were RCCs, 1 was an urothelial carcinoma and 1was an angiomyolipoma. With a mean followup of 14 months (range: 4–30 months), 24/26tumours were successfully ablated, 23 of which required only one treatmentsession. In 2 cases, a small enhancing nodule located at the margin proved tobe recurrent tumours. Two complications (1 haemorrhage requiring transfusionand 1 abscess drained percutaneously) occurred in a total of 27 cryoablations [85].
In 2006 Gupta et al. published CT-guided PCA on 27 tumours of 5 cmor less (mean size 2.5 cm), using conscious sedation and real-time CTmonitoring. With 1 month or more followup imaging available on 16 cases (mean5.9 months), 15 tumours showed no signs of enhancement. In 1 case, bloodtransfusion was required for bleeding [86].
The Mayo Clinic experience on 40 cases of PCA with CT monitoring hasrecently been published [87]. Mean tumour size was 4.2 cm(range: 3.0–7.2 cm) and atleast 3 months followup was available in 65% of the cases (mean 9 months;range: 3–22 months).Technical success, defined as extension of the ice ball beyond the tumourmargin and absence of postablation enhancement on CT, was reported in 38 (95%)cases, with no tumour recurrence or progression in the cohort. Overallcomplication rate for this cohort was reported at 8%.
Initial studies ofcombination therapy with 5-FU prior to freezing, indicated atemperature-dependent reduction on cell viability in a prostate cancer cell(PC-3) model [88]. Furthermore, molecular analysis using this model has demonstrateda synergistic effect of sublethal concentrations of 5-FU and Cisplatin prior tofreezing (−15°C), mediated by a shift in theBcl-2 to Bax ratio to a prodeath tendency [89]. Similar synergistic response has been reported in a renal cellmodel, the data suggesting that 5-FU chemotherapy may be more effective whenfollowed by cryosurgery [90]. In the clinical setting, synergistic activity of cryoablation andcyclophosphamide is currently been evaluated on advanced epithelial tumours(NCI. Trial protocol NCT00499733).
Equally, sincefreezing enhances the radiosentitivity of cells, combination of radiotherapywith cryoablation may potentially confer benefits [65], as already indicated in preclinical models of prostate cancer,where adjuvant radiation and curcumin havedemonstrated a synergistic effect with cryoablation [91].
Atthe time of writing this review, the Cleveland Clinic group have made publicthe initial results employing Single Port Access Renal Cryoablation (SPARC). Atotal of 6 patients, with mean tumour size of 2.6 ± 0.4 cm, successfullyunderwent SPARC, via a transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approach, with nointraoperative complications and no need for conversion, demonstrating thefeasibility and safety of this, potentially scarless, procedure [92, 93].
Furtherdevelopment of imaging techniques and cryoprobe technology, clinical evaluationof combination therapy with conventional chemo- and radiotherapy, together withpromising novel cryoenhancers, may have major implications on the management ofsmall renal masses in the future
Widespreadimplementation of USS, CT, and MRI has resulted in an increased detection ofearly, small renal masses. In the last 20 years, the proportion of incidentallyfound renal tumours raised from 13% to an estimated 60%, with a substantialparallel decrease in tumour stage, grade, and proportion of metastasis atpresentation, in these patients [94]. As a result, urologists are now faced with a new cohort of asymptomatic,healthier patients, with incidentally found small renal masses.
While open partialnephrectomy is still the reference standard [95], its associated morbidity has encouraged researchers and practicingclinicians towards less radical approaches, thus the rapid development oflaparoscopic partial nephrectomy and novel ablative techniques such asradiofrequency ablation (RFA), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), andcryoablation (CA). Amongablative techniques, cryotherapy, and in particular laparoscopic cryoablation, is the most extensively studied and the one with more rapid expansion in clinical practice.
Cryosurgery offersthe clear advantage of combining a nephron-sparing surgery together with aminimally invasive approach. Anaesthetic requirements, postoperative analgesia,and hospital stay are significantly reduced, with a much rapid return to normalactivity and work.
In the early daysof development and clinical implementation of cryoablation, concerns wereraised regarding safety of the procedure, the lack of followup, and oncologicaloutcome [96].
Regarding thesafety of the procedure, published studies up to this day have shown minimalprocedure-specific morbidity, with complication rates comparable or better thancurrent available minimally invasive procedures. Reports from the largestseries have demonstrated to be a less morbid procedure than laparoscopicpartial nephrectomy, with a comparable 5-year oncological safety [97].
Amongthe novel ablative techniques, radio frequency ablation (RFA) is the procedureswith more emerging clinical data. Although the procedure-specific morbidity,mostly based on small and nonstandardised series, appears to be low, seriousissues have been raised regarding the RFA cell-killing potential and its higherrisk of local disease recurrence, as demonstrated en several clinical studies [98–102].
When compared toRFA, available data from preclinical [52] and several clinical studies confer to cryoablation an advantageousoncological safety profile. The Cleveland Clinic group have recently publishedresults from their RFA and LCA series, highlighting the issue of residualdisease and demonstrating a clear advantage in the LCA cohort. With 109 renallesions (88 patients) treated with RFA and 192 lesions (176 patients) treatedwith LCA, radiographic (CT or MRI) success at 6 months was 85% and 90% for RFAand LCA, respectively. More importantly, when lesions were later biopsied at6 months, the success in the RFA cohort decreased to 64.8%, while LCA successremained high at 93.8%. Six of 13 patients (46.2%) with a 6-month positivebiopsy after radio frequency ablation demonstrated no enhancement on posttreatmentMRI or CT, while in the LCA group, all positive biopsies revealed posttreatmentenhancement on imaging just before biopsy. The authors recommend postradiofrequency ablation followup biopsy due to the significant risk of residualrenal cell cancer without radiographic evidence [103].
Supporting thesefindings, a recent meta-analysis of available data demonstrates a higher riskof local disease recurrence in tumours treated with RFA, when compared to thosemanaged by cryoablation [104].
While long-termfollowup is still awaited, encouraging results have been reported in serieswith up to 5-year followup, with cancer-specific survival rates ranging from 98to 100% [68, 70, 72, 73, 76, 105] withLCA and 97% with PCA [7]. This is comparable to 5-year cancer-specific survival rate of 92%,reported with partial nephrectomy [95, 97, 106].
Whileclinical application and indications of cryoablation of small renal masses arestill not clearly defined, it is recommended by available clinical evidence,that CA should be reserved for small (<3 cm) solid-enhancing renal massesin older patients with high operative risk. Young age, tumour size >4 cm,hilar tumours, intrarenal tumours, and cystic lesions can be regarded as relativecontraindication, whilst irreversible coagulopathy is widely accepted as anabsolute contraindication [107].
