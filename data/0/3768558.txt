Survival and prognosis among 1545 patients with contemporary polycythemia vera: aninternational study

Under the auspices of an International Working Group, seven centers submitted diagnosticand follow-up information on 1545 patients with World Health Organization-definedpolycythemia vera (PV). At diagnosis, median age was 61 years (51% females);thrombocytosis and venous thrombosis were more frequent in women and arterial thrombosisand abnormal karyotype in men. Considering patients from the center with the most maturefollow-up information (n=337 with 44% of patients followed todeath), median survival (14.1 years) was significantly worse than that of the age- andsex-matched US population (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, survival forthe entire study cohort (n=1545) was adversely affected by older age,leukocytosis, venous thrombosis and abnormal karyotype; a prognostic model that includedthe first three parameters delineated risk groups with median survivals of 10.9–27.8years (hazard ratio (HR), 10.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.7–15.0).Pruritus was identified as a favorable risk factor for survival. Cumulative hazard ofleukemic transformation, with death as a competing risk, was 2.3% at 10 years and5.5% at 15 years; risk factors included older age, abnormal karyotype andleukocytes ⩾15 × 109/l. Leukemic transformation was associatedwith treatment exposure to pipobroman or P32/chlorambucil. We found no associationbetween leukemic transformation and hydroxyurea or busulfan use.

Over the past century, polycythemia vera (PV) has undergone substantive changes in itsconcept and diagnostic criteria. The disease was first described in 18821 by Louis Henri Vaquez (1860–1936) and furtherelaborated by William Osler (1849–1919) in 1903.2 William Dameshek (1900–1969) included PV as one of the‘myeloproliferative disorders' in 1951.3 In 1976, the clonal nature of PV was deciphered,4 but it took another 20 years before William Vainchenker(b. 1947) discovered its signature mutation (JAK2V617F),5 which is, however, neither specific to PV nor believed toconstitute the disease-initiating event.6
Formal clinical research in PV started in 1967 with Louis Wasserman (1912–1999)establishing the Polycythemia Vera Study Group.7The Polycythemia Vera Study Group conducted a number of clinical trials in PV includingits seminal contribution of drug leukemogenicity associated with chlorambucil andP32.7 The Polycythemia Vera Study Group isalso credited for the first consensus diagnostic criteria in PV,7 which have since undergone substantial revisions by the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) subcommittee for classification of myeloid malignancies. Themost recent WHO document on PV underscores the diagnostic value of JAK2 mutationsand bone marrow morphology.8
This study is distinguished from previous studies in PV in its strict use of the 2008 WHOdiagnostic criteria9 and its main focus wassurvival and leukemic transformation. The large sample size enabled us to address a numberof clinically relevant questions: (i) What is the contemporary disease presentationprofile and is there a difference between men and women in this regard? (ii) How does lifeexpectancy compare with that of the age- and sex-matched control population? (iii) Whatpredicts overall and leukemia-free survival? (iv) Does exposure to certain drugs increasethe likelihood of leukemic transformation?
The International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) Research andTreatment (IWG-MRT) meets annually to organize clinical research projects and developconsensus criteria. The IWG-MRT recently published a series of papers that clarified thenatural history of WHO-defined essential thrombocythemia (ET) and its distinction fromprefibrotic myelofibrosis (MF).10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,16, 17, 18, 19 During the 2010IWG-MRT meeting in Florence, Italy, center and patient eligibility criteria for a largeinternational study in PV were discussed and followed up by a request for participation.Study eligibility criteria included strict adherence to the 2008 WHO diagnosticcriteria,9 availability of clinical andlaboratory information obtained within 1 year of diagnosis and before institution ofcytoreductive therapy, diagnosis date after 1970 and age ⩾18 years old.
After approval from their respective institutional review board, seven centers fromItaly, Austria and the United States collectively submitted diagnostic and follow-upinformation on 1818 patients, locally diagnosed with ‘WHO-defined PV'. The twoprinciple investigators (AT and TB) reviewed all submitted cases and, based on diagnosticaccuracy9 and the above stipulatedeligibility criteria, selected 1545 patients for further analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Conventional criteria were used for diagnosis ofpost-PV acute myeloid leukemia (AML),9 whereaspost-PV MF was annotated by the coinvestigators from each center with recommendations ofadherence to uniform criteria.20 Conventionallaboratory methods were used by each institution for JAK2 mutation screening,measurement of serum erythropoietin level and detection of endogenous erythroidcolonies.
All analyses were conducted using The Stat View (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), JMP (SASInstitute) or SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute) statistical packages. Pre-receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) plots were used to determine cutoff levels for continuous variablesof interest.21 Differences in the distributionof continuous variables between categories were analyzed by Mann–Whitney orKruskal–Wallis test. Patient groups with nominal variables were compared byχ2 test. Overall survival analysis was considered from the dateof diagnosis to date of death (uncensored) or last contact (censored). Observed survivalwas compared with the expected survival of the age- and sex-matched US total population.The rate of post-PV AML was calculated as the cumulative incidence of transformation,accounting for the competing risk of death.22All survival curves were prepared by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by thelog-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariableanalysis. P-values <0.05 were considered significant.
Table 1 provides all-inclusive and gender-stratifiedinformation on clinical and laboratory features at the time of diagnosis. Median age was61 years (10% were below age 40 years) and gender distribution was close to 1:1.Palpable splenomegaly, pruritus and vasomotor symptoms were each expressed by about athird of the patients. Venous thrombosis (9.3% vs 5.4% P<0.01)and thrombocytosis (60% vs 45.4% P<0.01) were more frequent inwomen and arterial thrombosis (18% vs 14% P=0.02) andpalpable splenomegaly (40.3% vs 32% P<0.01) in men. Asexpected, approximately 98% of the patients screened (n=1268)were positive for either JAK2V617F (95%) or other JAK2mutations (3%), whereas a subnormal serum erythropoietin level or endogenouserythroid colonies were documented in 81% and 73% of those tested,respectively. Less than 20% of the patients had undergone red cell massmeasurement. Abnormal karyotype at diagnosis was documented in 12% of thepatients examined (n=631) and was more frequent in men (15% vs9% P=0.02). Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase level andleukoerythroblastosis were, respectively, documented in 50% and 6% ofpatients evaluated.
At the time of this writing, 347 (23%) deaths, 50 (3%) leukemictransformations and 138 (9%) progressions to ‘post-PV MF' wererecorded (Table 2). Causes of death were reported on 164(47.3%) patients and listed in Table 2. Follow-uptime ranged from 0 to 39.3 years (median 6.9 years). The incidences of postdiagnosisarterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis and major hemorrhage were 12%, 9%and 4.2%, respectively. Treatment was according to individual physiciandiscretion and cytoreductive drug or aspirin use was documented in 1129 (73%) and1281 (84%) patients, respectively. Patients were assigned to operationaltreatment groups (Table 2) based on whether or not they wereexposed to drugs that are generally believed to be leukemogenic (for example,radiophosphorus or chlorambucil),23 wererecently implicated to be leukemogenic (pipobroman)24 or are controversial in terms of their leukemogenic potential(for example, hydroxyurea, busulfan).23
Median survival for the entire study cohort (n=1545) was projected at18.9 years and comparison with age- and sex-matched US population suggested a trendtowards worse survival (Figure 1; P=0.1).However, the particular comparison revealed significantly shortened life expectancy forpatients with PV (Figure 2; P<0.001) when theanalysis was restricted to one of the seven participating centers (the Mayo Cliniccohort) with the most mature survival data (n=337; 44% ofpatients followed to death; median survival 14.1 years). This phenomenon of survivaloverestimation as a result of immature survival data was further illustrated inSupplementary Figure 1, which showed significantintercenter differences in median survival projections (range 14.1 years to ‘notreached') that correlated with the proportion of uncensored data in each center(range 5–44%). Mature survival data obtained from the Mayo Clinic cohortwas also necessary to demonstrate inferior survival in both young and older patients inPV compared with the control population (Supplementary Figure2); the cutoff levels for age stratification were determined by ROCplots.21
Each one of the parameters listed in Table 1 was evaluatedfor its survival prediction value and if significant was chosen for furthermultivariable analysis (Table 3). Higher leukocyte count,venous thrombosis, leukoerythroblastic blood smear and abnormal karyotype sustained anage-independent adverse prognostic value, whereas thrombocytosis and pruritus wereassociated with better survival. Karyotype-exclusive multivariable analysis confirmedthe independent prognostic value of all of these variables (Table3). The inclusion of cytogenetic information to the multivariable modelreduced the number of fully informative cases from 964 to 383 and resulted in the lossof significance attached to thrombocytosis (P=0.09) andleukoerythroblastosis (P=0.36; Table 3).Incidentally, there was no difference in survival between patients withJAK2V617F vs other JAK2 mutations (P=0.86).
Because of the maturity of its survival data, the Mayo Clinic cohort(n=337) was used to prepare ROC plots to determine the best discriminantlevels for age and leukocyte count.21 Bothearly (10 years) and late (20 years) time points were considered in this regard and therespective optimal age cutoff levels were 67 years (area under the curve=0.82)and 57 years (area under the curve=0.89). A similar analysis resulted in aleukocyte cutoff value of 14.8 × 109/l (area under thecurve=0.64). Multivariable analyses for the entire study cohort(n=1545) using these ROC-determined cutoff values confirmed theirenhanced performance; karyotype-exclusive hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidenceinterval (CI)) were 8.5 (5.7–12.6) for age ⩾67 years, 2.9 (1.9–4.4) forage 57–66 years, 2.2 (1.6–3.0) for leukocyte count ⩾15 ×109/l, 1.8 (1.1–2.8) for venous thrombosis and 0.7(0.5–0.9) for pruritus (Supplementary Table2).
To develop a widely applicable prognostic model with objective parameters, we chose theROC-determined three-tired age categories (age ⩾67, 57–66 and <57 yearsold), leukocytosis (below or ⩾15 × 109/l) and venous thrombosis(present or absent) as important variables. We used the Mayo Clinic cohort(n=337) as the training set where multivariable analysis yielded HR(95% CI) of 10.3 (6.3–16.7) for age ⩾67 years, 3.9 (2.4–6.5) forage 57–66 years, 2.3 (1.3–4.0) for leukocyte count ⩾15 ×109/l and 1.6 (1.1–2.2) for venous thrombosis. Consequently,HR-weighted adverse points were assigned to age ⩾67 years (5 points), age57–66 years (2 points), leukocyte count ⩾15 × 109/l (1point) and venous thrombosis (1 point), to devise a prognostic model that includedlow-risk (0 points), intermediate-risk (one or 2 points) and high-risk (⩾3 points)categories.
The new prognostic model applied to the training set (the Mayo Clinic cohort) displayedexcellent discrimination between high-risk (n=155; mediansurvival=8.3 years; HR, 11.1; 95% CI: 6.3–19.6), intermediate-risk(n=100; median survival=15 years; HR, 3.5; 95% CI:1.9–6.2) and low-risk (n=82; median survival=26 years)patient groups and was subsequently validated in the entire study cohort(n=1545; Figure 3). Supplementary Figure 3 illustrates the influence of karyotype informationon survival data shown in Figure 3.
A total of 50 (3%) cases of post-PV AML were documented and occurred at a medianof 10.8 years (range 0.5–22.3) from diagnosis. Figure4 illustrates the cumulative incidence of post-PV AML, with death as acompeting risk: 2.3% at 10 years, 5.5% at 15 years and 7.9% at 20years. For purposes of visual comparison, this cumulative incidence curve was overlaidwith a separate curve representing the cumulative probability of transformation to AMLin which patients who died were censored (that is, ignoring the competing risk ofdeath). Both univariate and multivariable analyses of parameters at diagnosis identifiedolder age (HR, 6.3; 95% CI: 1.8–22.0), abnormal karyotype (HR, 3.9;95% CI: 1.2–13.1) and leukocyte count ⩾15 × 109/l(HR, 3.9; 95% CI: 1.3–11.6) as independent risk factors for leukemia-freesurvival (Table 3). We used the particular leukocyte cutofflevel based on our previously reported observation regarding its association withleukemic transformation in PV.25
Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between leukemic transformationand (i) anytime exposure to P32 or chlorambucil alone (P=0.007), (ii)anytime exposure to pipobroman alone (P=0.008) and (iii) anytimeexposure to pipobroman+hydroxyurea or busulfan (=0.03) (Supplementary Figure 4). Multivariable analysis that included age as acovariate confirmed these associations; HR (95% CI) were 2.1 (1.1–3.9) forage, 4.8 (1.2–18.4) for P32/chlorambucil alone, 3.9 (1.2–12.3) forpipobroman alone and 4.1 (1.2–14.2) for pipobroman+hydroxyurea/busulfan.These significant associations were sustained when leukocyte count ⩾15 ×109/l was added to the multivariable model, but the small number ofinformative cases did not allow additional analysis with karyotype as a covariate.Similar results were obtained when analysis considered only the initial cytoreductiveagents used (Figure 5). The association between pipobromanexposure and leukemic transformation became apparent at a later time point compared withthat seen with P32/chlorambucil (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 4). Exposure to single-agent busulfan(P=0.91), single-agent hydroxyurea (P=0.23) or bothbusulfan and hydroxyurea (P=0.44) was not associated with leukemictransformation (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 4).
A number of novel observations and important confirmations are born out of this study. Weshow, for the first time, the prognostic relevance of karyotype, which is in line with theexperience in most myeloid malignancies, including primary (PMF) and post-PVMF.26, 27 Thereason why this was not evident in previous PV studies might be related to inadequatesample size and follow-up time.28, 29 Unlike the case with PMF,26, 30, 31 the number of patients with cytogenetic abnormalities was too smallto further query differential prognostic effect associated with specific cytogeneticabnormalities. Regardless, our findings signify the potential value of obtainingcytogenetic information in patients with PV and warrant additional studies to determine ifthe acquisition of an abnormal karyotype carries a similar significance. It also pointsout the need to examine the prognostic contribution of submicroscopic genetic changes, ashas been the case in PMF.32, 33
Another novel observation from this study was the association between pruritus andsuperior survival. This might simply reflect a lead-time bias stemming from symptom-drivenearlier diagnosis. However, it is also possible that pruritus in PV is a marker of anunderlying favorable biology, as suggested by its previously reported association with alower incidence of arterial thrombosis.34Regardless, considering the negative effect on quality of life,35 the particular observation is consoling for patients withpruritus. The only other disease variable that was associated with good prognosis wasthrombocytosis, although its significance was less pronounced in the presence ofcytogenetic information. It is to be recalled that extreme thrombocytosis in WHO-definedET was associated with a lower incidence of arterial thrombosis.11 Taken together, these observations should serve to lessen thepressure to take therapeutic action in patients with PV or ET, based simply on plateletcount.
One of the core objectives of this study was to identify independent predictors of poorsurvival and develop a prognostic model; the IWG-MRT has previously accomplished this inWHO-defined ET.10 To that effect, bothkaryotype-exclusive and karyotype-inclusive multivariable analyses were performed. In thefirst instance, older age, leukocytosis, venous thrombosis and the presence of aleukoerythroblastic blood smear were found to be significant. The first three remainedsignificant when karyotype was added as a covariate. A prognostic model based on thesethree parameters and karyotype generated operational risk categories with median survivalsranging from 5.8 to 29.4 years. Advanced age and leukocytosis are also important riskfactors in ET10, 15 and PMF.36, 37, 38 Regarding the former, theobservations from this study favor a three-tiered rather than two-tiered agecategorization. Leukocytosis is a common marker of aggressive disease biology in myeloidmalignancies; however, prospective controlled studies are needed to determine if currentmanagement should be modified based on leukocyte count. The adverse survival impact ofotherwise unspecified ‘thrombosis' have previously been reported in bothET10 and PV,39 and based on the results from this study, it would be important tofurther clarify if the specific association involves arterial or venous thrombosis.
There is an ongoing controversy about the contribution of certain drugs to leukemictransformation in MPN. Controlled prospective studies have implicated treatment withchlorambucil,7 P327 or pipobroman24 as beingleukemogenic in PV, whereas large retrospective and population-based studies haverepeatedly shown the absence of such an association with hydroxyurea.25, 39, 40 The results from this study are consistent with these assertionsand, in addition, exonerate busulfan from such liability.41 This is comforting news for physicians who, respectively, usehydroxyurea and busulfan as first- and second-line cytoreductive drugs of choice in PV.Our study also confirmed the association between leukemic transformation and older age,leukocyte count ⩾15 × 109/l and also identified abnormalkaryotype as an additional risk factor for the same.
Another important observation from this study involves the inherent flaw associated withlife expectancy projections based on immature survival data. In other words, longevity inrelatively indolent diseases such as PV and ET might be exaggerated in the absence ofadequate number of uncensored events. In this study, 44% of the patients in theMayo Clinic cohort (n=337) were followed to death, whereas thecorresponding value for the entire study cohort (n=1545) was only23%. We believe that this was the main underlying reason for the substantiallydifferent median survival projections for the two cohorts (14.1 vs 18.9 years,respectively) and the fact that survival comparisons with the age- and sex-matched controlpopulation showed a significant difference for the former (P<0.001) but notthe latter (P=0.1).
In conclusion, this study contains information that is both practically useful andprovides context for the design and interpretation of clinical trials in PV. Consideringthe retrospective study design, our findings must be interpreted with caution, but we arecomforted by similar observations from a recent population-based study(n=327) where age >70 years, leukocyte count >13 ×109/l and thrombosis were identified as independent predictors of poorsurvival.39 Based on our large multicenterstudy, we are inclined to advocate the inclusion of cytogenetic studies during the initialevaluation of patients with PV and underscore the relative safety of treatment with eitherhydroxyurea or busulfan. The comparatively mature survival data from the Mayo Cliniccohort allows us to conclude that life expectancy in both young and older patients with PVis significantly shorter than expected in the absence of disease. Whereas theage-independent detrimental effect of leukocytosis, venous thrombosis and abnormalkaryotype is duly recognized, we are particularly intrigued by the biology behind thefavorable survival effect of pruritus. Finally, considering our novel observationregarding the prognostic relevance of karyotype, it is important to find out if the sameholds true for submicroscopic genetic changes, including mutations recently shown toaffect outcome in PMF and other myeloid malignancies.32, 33, 42,43, 44, 45, 46
