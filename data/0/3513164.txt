319 Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness in Obese Adolescents

Identify the frequency of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the obese and morbid obese adolescent. Compare the results of the direct challenge with gender and BMI.
We analyzed 215 bronchoprovocation challenges of adolescents from 10 to 18 years old in the period 2006 to 2010. We classified them in 3 groups: eutrophic (BMI < p85), obese (BMI p90–99) and morbid obeses (BMI > p99) without smoking contact of pulmonar disease. A basal spirometry was performed according to the ATS guidelines. If the FEV1 was above 80% for age and gender we performed the methacholine challenge. We use the dosimeter method with the following methacholine dilutions: 0.0625 mg, 0.25 mg, 1 mg, 4 mg and 16 mg. When a provocation concentration caused a 20% FEV1 reduced was considered a positive challenge for bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR).
Of the 215 adolescents in this study: 40 were eutrophic, 116 obese and 59 morbid obese. The methacholine challenges were positive in 12% of eutrophic, 22% of morbid obese and 25% of obese. But there were not a statistically significant difference. Gender was not associated as a risk factor for bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The positive bronchoprovation challege in women was observed in 27.6% of morbid obese, 23.7% of obese and 5% of eutrophic; in men 26.3% of obese, 20% of eutrophic and 16.7% of morbid obese. There was not a stadistically significant difference.
It is necessary a larger number of patients to concluded that BMI and gender are not associated with increased bronchial hyperresponsivess.
