NON COMPLETERS OF OPIATE DETOXIFICATION PROGRAM

Seventy two opiate dependent patients were admitted in de-addiction ward for detoxification. Twenty five patients (36.2%) left or were discharged prematurely and hence called non-completers. Demographic features, drug use characteristics and severity of withdrawal were found unrelated to the attrition.
