Objective:
The generation of ROS leading to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation are responsible for late complications of diabetes mellitus. In present study, we examined possible protective effect of aqueous extract of unripe fruit of Carica papaya Linn. (AUC) in experimental alloxan induced diabetes in rats.
Materials and Methods::
The effects of AUC on fasting blood glucose level (FBGL), oxidative stress parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and glutathione (GSH) in liver homogenates, terminal hepatic glycogen content and serum biochemical parameters were observed. To induce diabetes alloxan was injected i.p. at a single dose of 150 mg/kg. AUC (400 mg/ kg/ day p.o.) was administered to a group of diabetic rats (n=6) for 11 consecutive days and the observed data was compared with glibenclamide (10mg/ kg/ day p.o.) (n=6).
Results and Discussion:
Administration of AUC caused a reduction of 38.67 % FBGL from 155.7±1.6 mg/dl to 95.5±1.0 mg/dl (P< 0.001 versus diabetic control), MDA from 22.53±0.14 nmole/ mg protein to 5.5±0.34 nmole/mg protein (P<0.001 versus diabetic control), AOPP from 0.80±0.05 nmole/ mg protein to0.59±0.04 nmole/ mg protein (P<0.05 versus diabetic control). AUC decreased the oxidative stress by increasing GSH levels from 6.4±0.1 mg/100 g tissue to 7.53±0.02 mg/100 g tissue (P<0.05 versus diabetic control) and increased terminal hepatic glycogen from 3.29±1.4 mg/g to 8.78±0.015 mg/g (P<0.05 versus diabetic control). AUC caused significant improvement in the kidney, liver and lipid function.
Conclusion:
Results of present study suggest that Carica papaya Linn. have a moderate antihyperglycemic effect and this may be attributed to its antioxidant potential.

Ethanolic extract of Solanum xanthocarpum Schrad. and Wendl. (ESX) (Family: Solanaceae) was investigated for antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing activity in experimental animals. ESX was also evaluated for the anti-inflammatory activity using acute (carrageenan-induced paw oedema) and chronic (cotton pellet granuloma) models of inflammation in rats. The extract was found to possess significant antihistaminic action in histamine-induced bronchocontraction in guinea pigs. This may be suggestive of direct blockage of histamine receptor by ESX. The mast cell degranulation induced by compound 48:80 was significantly reduced by ESX. The effect was comparable to the reference standard Sodium cromoglycate. ESX also showed potent anti-inflammatory activity on both acute and chronic models of inflammation. These results suggest that ESX inhibits release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells which may be one of the mechanisms for its anti-inflammatory activity. The toxicity studies report safety usage of the plant extract. The present study for the first time reveals antihistaminic, anti-inflammatory and mast cell stabilizing potentials of S. Xanthocarpum. The plant may be useful in asthma and other inflammatory disease.

Chendooram is a catergory of medicine with reddish colour and a powdery form. Aya Chendooram consists of iron fillings, vinegar and odena bark juice. The anti inflamatory activity of the drug was studied on rat red blood cells, mast cells stabilisation, carrageenin inudced and polyvinyl pyrolidine induced paw inflammation. Aya Chendooram showed significant membrane stabilizing activity on mast cells and rat red blood cells. The anti–inflammatory was activity of this drug also revealed that it possess good anti inflamatory activity against both in–vivo and in–vitro models. Significant anti - inflammatory effect was shown by the drug on carrageenin and polyvinyl pyrrolidine induced paw edema in rats in both 40mg/kg and 80mg/kg dose levels but not significant in 20mg/kg dose level. The anti inflammatory activity showed by the drug may be due to prostaglandin synthesis inhibition or mast cell stabilisation and is therefore essential for anti inflammatory activity.

Cytochrome 450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) are the common targets for herbal drugs and therapeutic medicinal agents resulting in interaction. Herb-drug interactions are evidenced by many case reports resulting in precipitating fatal toxicity. Phyllanthus niruri is also known digestive, diuretic, antispasmodic, laxative, antihepatotoxic, hepatotonic, stomachic agent. The effect of ethanolic extract of Phyllanthus niruri stems on in vitro intestinal permeability of dexamethazone and oral clearance of different probes of cytochrome P450 was studied. Acute and chronic treatment of Phyllanthus niruri significantly (P < 0.01, F = 4.58, Df = 4) increased the absorptive permeability of dexamethazone as compared with that of saline and found even more than that of verapamil pre-treated groups and there by showed inhibition of Pgp. In studying the effect of Phyllanthus niruri extracts on metabolizing enzymes CYP 450; CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 were found to be not affected, but CYP3A, was found to be significant inhibited by hydro-alcoholic extracts of Phyllanthus niruri. It may conclude that Phyllanthus niruri showed negative modulation of Pgp and CYP3A which is indicative of its potential for modulation of absorption and metabolism of therapeutic drugs and importance towards pharmacokinetic herb-drug interaction.

In order to investigate the effect of antidiabetic herb Tinospora cordifolia on cyclosporin absorption and disposition, rabbits were given cyclosporin (10 mg/kg) with or without decoction of bark. In a crossover design FPIA method was used to determine the blood concentration of cyclosporin. The decoction was characterized by their amritosides A, B, C and D contents. Results showed that the coadministration of Tinospora cordifolia significantly increased the Cmax of cyclosporin by 68%. The AUC of cyclosporin was significantly elevated by 95% when coadministered with Tinospora cordifolia. Among the rabbits, 1/5 exhibits acute toxicity of cyclosporin after concomitant intake of Tinospora cordifolia. It indicates an interaction of amritosides with cyclosporin. It may conclude that the blood concentration of cyclosporin should be carefully monitored to avoid cyclosporin intoxication when coadministered with Tinospora cordifolia decoction.

Although Ayurvedic literature mentions the use of the root nodules of Premna herbaceae in ailments such as asthma, tumour and inflammation, scientific evaluation has so far not been done to verify these claims. The present study therefore was undertaken to find out the possible anticancer effect of the Root nodules of Premna herbacea Roxb. (Family:-Verbenaceae) in Ehrlich.s ascitic carcinoma (EAC) model. Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma was induced in Swiss albino mice by injecting 2.5 × 106 cell/ml of tumor cell suspension by i.p. Anticancer activity of the alcoholic extract (250 and 500 mg/kg i.p) was compared with that of Cisplatin (3.5 mg/kg i.p) on parameters such as percentage increase in weight, median survival time, hematology and in vitro cytotoxic effect of extract on EAC cell by tryphan blue exclusion assay. Alcoholic extract of Premna herbacea Roxb showed significant (P< 0.05) anticancer activity at different doses, in that it reduced the body weight, prolonged the life span of the tumor bearing animal. Besides, it also reversed the cancerassociated hematological changes in tumor-bearing animal.

Introduction:
Modulation of immune responses to alleviate the diseases has been of interest for many years. It is now recognized that immunomodulation could provide an alternative or complement to conventional chemotherapy for a variety of diseased conditions. Linseed is one of the oldest cultivated plants in India. Traditionally, it has been used as a laxative, expectorant, and demulcent for the symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort and as a poultice for symptomatic treatment of minor skin inflammations. Recent studies also indicate glucose lowering, lipid lowering, antitumor and estrogenic effects of linseed.
Objective:
The objective of the present work was to prepare extracts of linseed using different solvents and evaluate the same for immunomodulatory activity using pyrogallol induced rat model.
Materials and Methods:
Pyrogallol (50mg/kg, i.p) was administered to produce immunosuppression in Wistar rats (n=6/group) for 28 days and concomitantly treated with standard and test drug at three dose levels. Animals were challenged on the 14th and 21st day for immunological responses. Antibody titre determination, delayed type hypersensitivity reaction and in vitro phagocytosis studies were carried out on the 21st, 28th and 29th day. In vivo phagocytosis was also carried out using carbon clearance method.
Results and Conclusion:
Present study substantiates that linseed is a potent immunostimulant, significantly stimulating (P<0.01) both specific and non-specific immune responses in a dose dependent manner.

Objective:
Cassia fistula L., (Leguminoseae), a semi-wild Indian Laburnum (also known as the Golden Shower). In spite of the vast pharmacological activities of this plant, its protective effect on the liver toxicity has not been well documented. Hence, the present investigation was designed to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of ethanolic extract of bark of Cassia fistula.
Method:
The ethanolic (95%) extract of bark of Cassia fistula (CFB) was prepared by maceration. Carbon tetrachloride with olive oil (1:1) (0.2ml/kg, i.p.) was administered for ten days used to induce hepatotoxicity. CFB (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) and Silymarin (100 mg/kg p.o.) were administered for fourteen days. The carbon tetrachloride, Silymarin and the extract were administered concomitantly to the respective groups of animals. The hepatoprotective effect of the extract was evaluated by the assay of liver function biochemical parameters (serum transaminase ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, protein and triglycerides).
Results:
The results obtained showed that the toxic effect of carbon tetrachloride was controlled significantly with the treatment of CFB (200 and 400 mg/kg p.o.) by restoration of the levels of serum transaminase ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, protein and triglycerides.
Conclusion:
Thus, Cassia fistula bark possesses potential to protect the liver against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity in rats.

J.S.S College of Pharmacy, Ooty, India.
This study reports the anti-inflammatory and membrane stabilizing property of an ethanolic root extract of Rubus ellipticus (RE) Smith in rats. It belongs to Rosaceae family commonly known in India as Zardanchu or Hinsalu in Hindi and in English yellow Himalayan raspberry. The carrageenan-induced rat paw edema was utilized as a model for acute inflammatory and the probable mode by which Rubus ellipticus mediates its effects on inflammatory condition was studied on rat blood cells exposed to hypotonic solution. The results of the study revealed that the extract possesses anti-inflammatory activity. Rubus ellipticus significantly (P<0.01, P<0.001) reduced the oedema swelling induced by carrageenin in rats at both the dose levels of 250 and 500 mg/kg, while 125mg/kg did not show any significant activity. However, the extract did not exhibit membrane stabilizing property, as it failed to significantly (P<0.05) reduced the levels of haemolysis of RBC exposed to hypotonic solution. The acute toxicity studies of oral doses of ethanolic root extract in rats revealed that it has a high safety profile, as the extract was well tolerated by the animals. The results of the study suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity demonstrated by Rubus ellipticus may not be related to membrane stabilization.

Introduction:
In traditional system of medicine a number of herbal preparations have been used for the treatment of peptic ulcers. Calotropis procera is one such plant that has been used for the treatment for gastrointestinal disorders. The chloroform extract of its roots has been reported to exhibit antiulcer properties. In view of this, in present study we have evaluated the antiulcer effect of latex of Calotropis procera in rat model.
Method:
Gastric ulcers were induced in rats by oral administration of 1ml absolute ethanol. The rats were sacrificed 1hr later and stomach was dissected out and examined for calculating ulcer index. Different doses of aqueous extracts (20 and 100mg/kg) and methanol extracts (10 and 50 mg/ kg) of dried latex of Calotropis procera and famotidine (20mg/kg) were orally administered 1hr prior to the administration of absolute ethanol. The parameters of oxidative stress were also measured in the gastric mucosal tissue.
Results:
Treatment of rats with aqueous extract and methanol extract of dried latex produced a marked reduction in ulcer index. The extent of inhibition was found to be 58.33% and 95.83% in case of aqueous extracts (20 and 100mg/ kg) and 83.33% and 81.25% in case of methanol extracts (10 and 50 mg/kg) respectively. The protection afforded by latex extracts was comparable to the standard antiulcer drug famotidine (62.5%). The protective effect was accompanied by normalization of levels of parameters of oxidative stress.
Conclusion:
Our study shows that latex of Calotropis procera has the potential to be used as an antiulcer agent.

Introduction:
Obesity is chronic condition characterized by excess body fat that is quantified by the elevation in body weight of the patient. It is accepted that obesity result from disequilibrium between energy intake and expenditure and this condition has a large impact on several metabolic and chronic ailments including heart disease, arthritis, hyperlipidemia and NIDDM. To date, pharmacological treatments do not appear to be effective in producing sustained long-term weight loss. Therefore, future research is necessary to discover new drug therapies that can be used to reduce the prevalence of obesity. So that the present study was undertaken to evaluate ethanolic extract of B.monosperma bark (EEBM).
Methods:
Obesity was induced in albino rats by feeding cafeteria diet /atherogenic diet daily for 40 days to Group I to VI. Group I and II are referred as Negative and Positive control respectively. EEBM was administered in dose of 200, 400, 800mg/kg, p.o. to Group III, IV and V. The effect of extract on following parameters was recorded – body weight, food intake, body temperature, locomotor activity and biochemical parameters like serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Result:
The EEBM treatment at 400 and 800-mg/kg caused significant reduction in body weight, food intake, serum glucose, lipid level and increase in locomotor activity and body temperature.
Conclusion:
The result of the present study concludes that EEBM showed anti-obese activity in cafeteria and atherogenic diet fed rats. The effect produced was comparable with that produced by standard anti-obese drug sibutramine.

Objective:
To evaluate the in vitro antioxidant activity and in vivo hepatoprotective activity of methanolic extract of leaves of Justicia gendarussa.
Methods:
Methanolic extract of leaves of J. gendarussa (JME) was prepared by soxhlet extraction method. The antioxidant potency of JME was evaluated by using well established in vitro methods, such as DPPH radical scavenging, Hydroxyl radical (·OH) scavenging H2O2 scavenging and Ferric ion reduction activity. Also Total Phenolic Content (TPC) and flavonoid content (TFC) were determined. In vivo hepatoprotective activity was tested on CCl4 induced acute heaptototoxicity in rats at 3 different dose levels. The different biochemical estimations were carried out like SGOT, SGPT, total bilirubin, total proteins, GST, SOD, Catalase and peroxidase.
Results:
JME showed potent antioxidant activity in vitro. In each method IC50 values were determined and compared with different standards. IC50 values of JME in DPPH radical scavenging, Hydroxyl radical (·OH) scavenging, H2O2 scavenging and Ferric ion reduction activity were comparable with standards. JME protected the rats significantly when compared to control (CCl4 treated rats) in all the parameters. TPC and TFC were found to be 164.16+3.00 (mg GAE/g of extracts), 54.33+ 4.50 mg/g of quercetin.
Conclusion:
JME protected the rats by CCl4 injury which is a free radical mediated. JME also showed potent antioxidant activity in vitro. The hepatoprotective activity of JME might be due to its antioxidant activity, which is may be due to the total phenolic/flavonoid content of the extract. So it was concluded that total phenolic/flavonoids are responsible for its hepatoprotective activity.

Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of Pharmacy, C.B. D. Belapur, Navi Mumbai, India.
Introduction:
Peptic ulcer occurs due to imbalance between offensive acid-pepsin secretions versus defensive (cytoprotective) mucosal resistance. Increased use of common NSAIDS like aspirin, indomethacin etc. causes damage by inhibiting biosynthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins. These drugs cannot be used for long term in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis with peptic ulcer. In this study, effect of 50% ethanolic extract of Cynodon dactylon Pers. on ulcerogenic potential of indomethacin was studied.
Materials and Methods:
50% ethanolic extract of Cynodon dactylon Pers. was administered in the dose of 300 and 600 mg/ kg orally 30 minutes prior to ulcer induction in Male Sprague-Dawley rats. The gastric ulcers were induced by oral administration of indomethacin. Famotidine was used as a reference standard drug.
Results:
The antiulcer activity was assessed by determining and comparing the ulcer index in the test drug group with that of the vehicle control group and standard group. Both the doses, 300 and 600 mg/ kg of test drug showed a protective effect on indomethacin- induced ulcers with 56.74% and 79.61% ulcer inhibition rate, respectively.
Conclusion:
These results suggested that Cynodon dactylon Pers. possesses anti- ulcer activity

Sawant O, Ghosh R, Kadam VJ
Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of Pharmacy, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai, India.
A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is a drug that blocks one or more of the five subtypes of the enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), therefore preventing the inactivation of the intracellular second messengers, (cAMP) and (cGMP). PDE9 is highly specific for cGMP and not inhibited by the nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX). BAY 73-6691 has been characterized in vitro as the first potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9), which is currently under preclinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. BAY 73- 6691 improves learning and memory in rodents. Zardaverine (ZAR) and SCH 51866 are selective inhibitors and have recently been introduced as a potent bronchodilator and antiplateletantiproliferative agents respectively. Currently preclinical trials on PDE9 inhibitors for treating type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease are underway. Here we review the potential of PDE9 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide array of diseases.

Holarrhena pubescens belongs to the family Apocynacea, commonly known as “kurchi” is highly reputed in traditional medicine as a remedy for amoebic dysentery and other intestinal ailment. Bioassay-directed fractionation of the ethanolic extract of Holarrhena pubescens resulted in the isolation of steroidal alkaloids i.e. holamide and pubscinine. Holamide showed a three proton doublet at 1.45 (J=6.56 Hz) and two AB doubles at 3.17 and 3.00 each for on proton (J=12.06 Hz) in the 1H NMR spectrum suggested that it belongs to conanine series of alkaloid (A class of compound with the steroid nucleus and a five members heterocyclic ring with nitrogen). In contrast pubscinine showed one methyl at 1.28 while the doublet is missing a three proton singlet was observed at 2.28 due to a vinylic methyl indicated a double bond in the 18, 20 – epimino ring of the conanine series of alkaloids. In anaesthetized rats, the holamide and pubscinine caused a fall in blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals atropine completely abolished the hypotensive response of acetycholine; whereas hypotensive effect of holamide and pubscinine were not modified by atropine. Similarly acetylcholine produced contractile effect in guinea-pig ileum, which was antagonized by atropine, however both (holamide and pubscinine) failed to produced any stimulant response on guinea-pig ileum. These data indicate that the steroidal alkaloids i.e. Holamide and Pubscinine from Holarrhena pubescens mediated hypotensive response through a mechanism different to that of acetycholine.

Studying the effect on isolated goat tracheal chain preparation and on Capillary permeability in mice (n=5).
Results:
Methanol fraction of ethanol extract of Solanum xanthocarpum flowers (MFSXEE) able to show a clear rightward shift in histamine–response curve in dose dependent manner than benzene and ethyl acetate fraction. Drug shown to have significant antagonistic effect (P<0.05) on histamine induced (1.6μg/ml) contraction at a dose of 2, 4, 10 mg/ ml (70.12±1.269, 56.09±1.928 and 48.17±0.787 respectively). This indicates the relaxant effect exerted by depression of histamine H1 receptor may be due to presence of flavonoids, phytosterols or saponins in polar methanol fraction. As well treatment group with benzene, ethyl acetate and methanol fractions at a dose of (25, 50, 100 mg/kg i.p) shows value of significance (P<0.05) with methanol fraction (MFSXEE) at highest dose of 100 mg/ kg i.p. (313.25±15.80) as compared to control group (618.80±16.38) which was sensitized and challenged with bovine albumin and Freund’s adjuvant 0.05 ml /kg i.p. in mice.
Conclusion:
The results obtained indicate that the fraction possesses antihistaminic and antianaphylactic properties, which may account for its use as an antiasthmatic in traditional medicine.

Manipal College of Pharmaceutical sciences, Manipal University, Manipal, India.
Sphaeranthus indicus (Asteraceae) is a medicinally important plant used as folk medicine. Several populations in northern India use this plant to control diabetes. The plant is also used for the treatment of urethral ailments, chronic skin diseases and jaundice. As very significant antioxidant activity has been observed in our laboratory with this plant, it was thought worthwhile investigating the nephroprotective activity of S.indicus. There is no report in literature of any earlier work on this activity. The ethanol extract of the entire plant material was subjected to nephroprotective screening in gentamicin induced acute renal injury in albino male wistar rats. Gentamicin induced renal injury resulted in elevated biochemical markers namely blood urea and serum creatinine followed by decreased total protein, serum albumin. The histopathological feature was acute tubular necrosis. The ethanolic extract of S. indicus at the dose level 300 mg/kg was found to normalize the changed blood urea, serum creatinine, total protein and serum albumin and bring about near to normal recovery in the kidneys, as evidenced microscopically. While investigating into the possible protective effect of Sphaeranthus indicus, it was observed that 10 days administration of the said extract in the prophylactic regimen prior to gentamicin administration (80 mg/kg, single dose, i.p), prevented the renal injury as indicated by normalized biochemical parameters and histopathological features. The findings suggest that the ethanol extract of S. indicus possesses nephroprotective activity with minimal toxicity and could offer a promising role in the treatment of acute renal injury inflicted by adverse effects of drugs like gentamicin.

The most common respiratory disorders which have been studied are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders. Conventional treatment uses drugs to either control symptoms or relieve the discomfort but can never eliminate the ailment. Vitex negundo has been ethnopharmacologically documented to be used in treating respiratory disorders. Ethanolic leaf extract of Vitex negundo (VNLE) and crude powder of Vitex negundo (VNCE) at a dose of 100mg/kg body weight were evaluated for antiasthmatic activity in ovalbumin induced asthma in wistar albino rats. The total WBC count present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was higher in control animals when compared with VNLE and VNCP. Our results also suggest that the production of nitrate was significantly reduced by VNLE and VNCP. VNLE and VNCP significantly decreased (P<0.001) the serum IgG and tissue malonyldialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels and brought the values to normal. So by concluding all the above factors suggested that Vitex negundo leaf or aerial parts can be evaluated for treating clinical asthmatic disorder.

Introduction:
In Indian traditional medicine, the bark of Holoptelea integrifolia (family: Urticaceae) is used to treat intestinal tumors and paste of the bark is externally applied to treat the inflammation of lymph glands. Therefore the present study was undertaken to investigate the possible antitumor and antioxidant activity of Holoptelia integrifolia stem bark extract.
Methods:
In vitro antioxidant activity of alcoholic extract of Holoptelea integrifolia was tested in three well established methods. In vitro cytotoxicity in Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma [EAC] and Dalton’s Ascites Lymphoma was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion method and MTT bioassay was used to determine in vitro cytotoxicity in human cancer lines [HeLa and MCF-7]. The EAC and DLA inoculated mice were used to assess cytotoxicity in liquid and solid tumor respectively. In EAC model, mean survival time [MST], hematological parameters, endogenous antioxidant enzymes were assessed. However, in solid tumor only tumor volume and weight were recorded.
Results:
Extract showed significant in vitro antioxidant activity in the tested methods. Extract also caused significant in vitro cytotoxicity in EAC, DLA, MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines. In liquid tumor, extract at 100mg/kg (i.p) was found most effective by increasing the MST, maintained normal hematological parameters and endogenous antioxidant enzymes. In solid tumor, significant reduction in tumor volume and weight was observed in animals treated with extract at the same dose.
Conclusion:
Extract showed significant in vitro antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. In in vivo study the extract at 100mg/kg was effective in reversing all the parameters in EAC and DLA inoculated mice.

In this study, we investigated the protective effect of 80% methanol extracts from various kiwi fruits on tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced cytotoxicity in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Kiwi extracts significantly reduced t-BHP-induced oxidative injury in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, based on the tests of cell cytotoxicity, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In addition, the extracts reduced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP protein. Moreover, kiwi extracts reduced the levels of 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, superoxide radicals and lipid peroxidation. The results suggest that kiwi extracts have potential protective effect against oxidative damage induced in HepG2 cells. The results could be beneficial for liver diseases where it is known that oxidative stress plays a crucial role.

Introduction:
Abroma augusta has been used traditionally for the treatment of sores. The wound healing profile of alcoholic extract of Abroma augusta and its effect on dexamethasone suppressed wound healing was evaluated in Wistar rats.
Methods:
An alcoholic extract of Abroma augusta was prepared. Three models were used - incision, excision and dead space wound models. Four groups of animals were used for each model. They were administered 2% gum acacia, A.augusta, dexamethasone and A.augusta with dexamethasone respectively. The parameters studied included breaking strength of incision wound, epithelization and wound contraction rate in the excision wound model, breaking strength, dry weight and hydroxyproline content of granulation tissue in dead space wound model.
Results:
The breaking strength of incision wound of A.augusta treated group was significantly increased (P<0.000) while that of dexamethasone treated animals was significantly decreased (P<0.000) as compared to control. Co-administration of dexamethasone and A.augusta significantly reversed the dexamethasone suppressed wound healing in incision wound model (P<0.001). Animals treated with dexamethasone and A.augusta showed significant reduction in the period of epithelization as compared to rats treated with dexamethasone alone (P<0.011). Co-administration of dexamethasone and A.augusta significantly (P<0.004) increased the breaking strength of granulation tissue in the dead space wound model as compared to dexamethasone treated group.
Conclusion:
The alcoholic extract of Abroma augusta was found to increase the wound breaking strength and reverse dexamethasone suppressed wound healing.

Manipal College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal, Karnataka, India.
Introduction:
In traditional medicine the root of Schrebera swietenioides Roxb. was used for diabetes in the form of paste. Therefore the present study was undertaken to explore possible antidiabetic activity.
Methods:
The roots of the plant were extracted with absolute alcohol by soxhlet extraction and fractionated into dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA) and butanol (BUT) fractions. Aqueous extract was prepared by maceration. Diabetes was induced in rats by low dose STZ following high- fat diet. The antidiabetic effect of extract was evaluated by parameters like blood glucose (FBS), body weight, lipid profile (serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, HDL-C), protein catabolism (total protein, creatinine). In vitro anti diabetic activity was evaluated by inhibition of non enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin method and Advanced Glycation End products inhibition assay (AGE inhibition).
Results:
In inhibition of haemoglobin glycation assay, 1mg/ml concentration of aqueous (MAC), ethyl acetate (EA), butanol (BUT), dichloromethane (DCM) showed percentage inhibition as: 74.3%, 78.3%, 58%, 75% respectively. Ethyl acetate fraction was found potent for haemoglobin glycation inhibition. Aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions showed AGE inhibition properties. In vivo results suggested that both alcoholic and aqueous fractions reduced FBS (fasting blood sugar) in diabetic rats significantly (P< 0.05). Neither fraction had any lipid lowering properties.
Conclusion:
In vitro results suggest that extracts of Schrebera swietenioides Roxb. have good AGE inhibition and haemoglobin glycation inhibiton activity. In vivo results suggest that alcoholic and aqueous extracts have moderate antidiabetic activity. The plant did not exhibit any hypolipidaemic activity.

Introduction:
Anximin is a polyherbal formulation and its scientific validation is lacking. The objective of present study was to evaluate the putative nootropic activity of Anximin through validated animal models of learning and memory viz. transfer latency (TL) on elevated plus maze, passive avoidance (PA) and scopolamine induced amnesia. To elucidate the mechanism of action, a receptor binding study was also performed using rat’s hippocampus.
Methods:
Wistar rats (200 ± 20 g) were used for these experiments. Anximin was administered at two dose levels (20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) once daily for 7 consecutive days as suspension in 0.3 % carboxy methyl cellulose. Piracetam (100 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as standard. Behavioural experiments were performed 1 hr after last drug administration on day 7.
Results and Conclusion:
Anximin (40 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) shortened the TL on day 1, 2 and 9. Anximin (20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated the amnestic deficits induced by scopolamine. Similarly in PA, only the higher dose of Anximin (40 mg/kg) produced a significant (P < 0.05) increase in step through latencies; along with a significant (P < 0.05) reversal of scopolamine induced amnesia of PA at both the dose levels. Results of receptor binding study indicated a significant (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively) increase in 3[H] QNB binding to muscarinic receptors in hippocampus with both the doses of Anximin. These findings indicate a possible nootropic action of Anximin, attributed to its action on muscarinic receptors.

PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.
Background:
There is documented evidence of use of Terminalia chebula for various ailments in the Ayurvedic literature. The extract has shown to possess glucose lowering activity and improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present study was carried out to study the dose response relationship of this extract in a rat model of metabolic syndrome.
Methods:
Six groups of rats were fed high fructose diet (HFD) for a period of 20 days to induce metabolic syndrome. Three doses of fruit extract of Terminalia chebula 50, 100 and 150mg/kg were administered orally and pioglitazone 2.7mg/kg was used as positive control. Blood samples were collected at day 0, 20 and 40 from the tail vein. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using tail cuff method and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was done on the day of blood collection.
Results:
Administration of HFD for twenty days significantly increased fasting blood glucose (FBG), SBP, and area under curve of OGTT. On the day forty the FBG in the 50, 100 and 150mg/kg group was 97.33±5.82 (NS), 86.83±5.08 (p=0.038) and 85.67±6.74 (p=0.15) respectively. There was no significant difference in the SBP in the three doses of the extract at day forty.
Conclusions:
these results show that the fruit extract of Terminalia chebula exerts significant and dose dependent glucose lowering effect in rat model of metabolic syndrome.

Plantain banana (Musa sapientum var. paradisiaca, MS) has been shown to possess peptic ulcer protective activity. The present work with MS was undertaken with the premise that the drug promoting ulcer healing could have effect on wound healing also. Wound healing activity of MS was studied in terms of (i) percent wound contraction, epithelization period and scar area; (ii) wound breaking strength and (iii) on granulation tissue antioxidant status (estimation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH), free radical (lipid peroxidation, an indicator of tissue damage) and connective tissue formation and maturation (hexuronic acid, hydroxyproline and hexosamine levels) in excision, incision and dead space wound models respectively using standard procedures. The rats were given oral graded doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) of aqueous (MSW) and methanolic (MSE) extracts of MS for a period of 10 to 21 days depending upon the type of study. Both MSW and MSE (100 mg/kg) showed optimal effect on wound contraction and epithelization in excision wound when administered for 21 days. Both MSW/MSE (100 mg/kg for 10 days) increased wound breaking strength and levels of hydroxyproline, hexuronic acid, hexosamine, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione in the granulation tissue and decreased percentage of wound area, scar area and lipid peroxidation when compared with the control group. The result of the present study thus, does indicate that plantain banana favoured wound healing which could be due to its antioxidant effect and on various wound healing biochemical parameters promoting the process of early keratinisation and healing.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by persistent and relapsing fatigue, often accompanied by numerous symptoms involving various body systems. The etiology of CFS remains unclear, but a number of studies have shown that oxidative stress and inflammation may be involved in its pathogenesis. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of sesamol, a natural phenolic compound, in a mouse model of immunologically induced fatigue, wherein purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as Brucella abortus (BA) antigen were used as immunogens. Animals were subjected to forced swimming test session of 6 minutes on 1st, 7th, 14th, 19th and 21st day; a significant increase in immobility time on 19th day represented the CFS in mice. Biochemical analysis revealed that the chronic swim test significantly increased lipid peroxidation levels and decreased glutathione levels in mouse whole-brain homogenate. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were also markedly increased with LPS or BA challenge. Concurrent treatment with sesamol oil resulted in the significant reduction in the immobility time and there was significant attenuation of oxidative stress as well as TNF-α level. These preliminary findings suggest the pivotal role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathophysiology of CFS and that sesamol could be used as potential agent in the management of CFS.

Traditionally, Punica granatum is used for the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery and ulcerations. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the ameliorative role of Punica granatum L. in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced ulcerative colitis in mice. Ulcerative colitis was induced by administering 2% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. Methanolic extract of Punica granatum L. was administered (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg p.o.) daily for 7 days i.e., starting from the day of colitis induction. Sulphasalazine (100 mg/kg p.o.) was used as standard drug. The extent and severity of ulceration was analyzed macroscopically and histopathologically. Biochemical analyses of myeloperoxidase (MPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), and tissue lipid peroxides (TBARS) was done for exploring the possible mechanism of actions of Punica granatum. Administration of DSS resulted in induction of severe ulcerative colitis in mice in the form of bloody diarrhea, colonic ulcerations, severe intestinal inflammation and extensive mucosal damage as assessed macroscopically and histopathologically. Biochemically, there was significant rise in tissue MPO, TBARS and reduction in GSH levels. Treatment with Punica granatum L. (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg p.o) significantly attenuated DSS induced bloody diarrhea, colonic ulcerations, intestinal inflammation and mucosal damage and also normalized biochemical alterations comparable to that of standard drug sulphasalazine. It may be concluded that Punica granatum ameliorates dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis in mice possibly through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions.

Strychnos nux-vomica Linn. (Loganiaceae) is used traditionally for the treatment of rheumatism and other inflammatory conditions. Antilipid peroxidative property of S. nuxvomica has been reported. It also possesses significant metal chelation property. The present study was undertaken to screen the relationship between antiinflammatory and antioxidant activity of S. nuxvomica seed extract. The anti-inflammatory activity of S nuxvomica extract was studied on acute and chronic phases of inflammation using carrageenan induced paw edema and the cotton pellet granuloma test, respectively. The efforts has been made to explain the mechanism of action by studying antioxidant property on enzymic and nonenzymic models of lipid peroxidation accompanied by measuring reduced glutathione level under normal and toxic condition. In order to evaluate antihepatotoxic activity of S. nuxvomica extract, level of serum transaminases (SGOT and SGPT) was measured. Extract (50–200 mgkg−1 b.w., p.o.), when tested against carrageenan induced paw oedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma, exhibited dose and time dependent significant inhibition on both the models of inflammation. Enzymic and nonenzymic models of lipid peroxidation were induced by Fe3+-ADP (1.6 mM-62 μM) and FeSO4 (0.5mM) respectively. The extract inhibited both the models of lipid peroxidation in a dose dependent manner. ED50 was found to be 149μg/ml and 85μg/ml on FeSO4 and Fe3+-ADP models respectively. It significantly inhibited aerobic and FeSO4 induced depletion of GSH in time and dose dependent manner. Oral treatment of drug up to 300 mgkg−1 b.w. for 30 days did not show any rise in serum transaminases. Results indicate that the ethanol extract of Strychnos nux-vomica possess potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant property with no detectable adverse effect.

Inflammation is one of the underlying mechanism in several chronic disease conditions like coronary artery disease, asthma, Alzheimer’s, arthritis and some cancers. In the present study the formulation chosen is a classical polyherbal one containing ingredients of plant and mineral origin. The study involved the pharmacognostical and pharmacological validation of the formulation. The total ash, acid insoluble and water soluble ash were determined to be 39.86%, 12.89%, 33.65%respectively. The pharmacological validation involved acute models like carragenan, 5-HT and histamine induced rat paw edema. In the carragenan induced rat paw edema model, the 125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg showed significant activity (P<0.001) at the end of fifth and fourth hour respectively. In histamine induced edema, significant activity (P<0.001) was produced with 125 mg/kg at the third hour, with 250 mg/kg at the second hour. Similar, significant results were obtained with 5-HT induced edema. Prolonged effects of the formulation was studied using cotton pellet granuloma and Freund’s adjuvant induced arthritis model. The efficacy of the formulation in the cotton pellet granuloma model was comparable to that of the positive control (P<0.001). Significant effects was also produced in Freund’s adjuvant induced arthritic model and brought the arthritic condition to near normal. The formulation at 0.1, 0.5 and 5 mg/ml exhibited significant membrane-stabilizing activity (P< 0.05) and significant mast –cell stabilizing activity (P< 0.001) at 10 and 100 μg/ml. Thus, it can be concluded that this preparation showed significant anti-inflammatory activity.

Curcumin has been ethnopharmacologically documented for its use in respiratory and inflammatory ailments, and asthma is fundamentally a respiratory disorder involving mediators of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of curcumin on bio-molecular parameters involved in asthma in rats. Asthma was induced in rats by sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA) except the normal (i.e. saline treated) group. Except the normal and the sensitized control (i.e. only OVA treated) groups the remaining three groups were treated with standard drug, curcumin (100 mg/kg) and (200 mg/kg) respectively. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue homogenate were obtained following sacrifice after 60 days of treatment and nitrate, malonyldialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, and percentage of intact and granulated mast cells were determined. On treatment with OVA; nitrate (303.66±1.87), MDA (39.25±0.95), MPO (22.6±0.68) levels were elevated, whereas percentage of intact mast cells (13.5±2.3) was decreased in comparison to normal levels. The curcumin- II (i.e. curcumin, 100 mg/kg treated) group reverted values of different parameters closer to normal (i.e. saline treated) group values as compared to the values of curcumin-I (i.e. curcumin, 200 mg/kg treated) group but the standard treatment was most significant in normalizing values. Curcumin modestly restored altered bio-molecular parameters in asthma. But, the exact molecular mechanism by which curcumin reduces the levels of malonyldialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) is still not resolved. So, it needs further pharmacological investigation and clinical trial study of curcumin in order to cultivate a potential restorative agent for the treatment of clinical asthma.

The present study was to investigate the effect of curcumin in Wistar rats in 5/6 nephrectomized rat model. The curcumin was administered at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg orally for 60 days. After 60 days parameters such as body weight, blood pressure, haemoglobin, cholesterol, triglycerides were estimated. The kidneys from all the groups were subjected to histopathological evaluation. Treatment with curcumin 200 mg/ kg showed significant reduction of body weight, cholesterol and triglycerides levels as compared to nephrectomized control. A significant decrease in blood pressure and increased haemoglobin were observed at 200mg/kg curcumin. Histological study of kidney tissue showed no congestion of interstitium, tubular capillaries and glomerular tuft of capillaries without focal haemorrhage. Curcumin ameliorated the parameters by normalizing the elevated levels in experimental rats. Thus the efficacy of curcumin of curing or alleviating CRF is a potential herbal, medicine.

Gastric ulcer is a serious gastrointestinal disease which occurs due to excessive acid secretion in the stomach. Natural drugs mostly augment the defensive factors and may be slow in activity but are reliable and safe. The present study was undertaken to study the antioxidant and cytoprotective activity of the Ayurvedic formulation (AYF-1) in aspirin induced gastric mucosal damage in rats. The ayurvedic formulation (AYF-1) was evaluated at two dose levels (350mg/kg and 700mg/kg)orally. The parameters observed include ulcer index, mucin content, non-sulphhydryl(NP-SH), catalase(CAT), lipid peroxidase(LPO) and superoxide dismutase(SOD). The results indicate that the formulation at both dose levels(350mg/kg and 700mg/kg) produced significant reduction in the ulcer index but at 350mg/kg dose level, it was significant than the positive control in decreasing ulcer index (P<0.05) and at 700mg/kg dose level was equipotent to positive control. There was significant increase in the mucin content (P<0.01) and at 700mg/kg dose level is equipotent to positive control. There was significant increasing non-protein sulfahydryl(NP-SH) (P<0.01) but at 700mg/kg dose level was found to be equipotent to positive control. The antioxidant effect of formulation at both dose levels was capable of producing significant decrease (P<0.01) in catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase(SOD) and a significant decrease in lipid peroxide (LPO). It may be said that the formulation may have increased mucin activity and antioxidant property which is direct indication of gastric mucosal protection. Thus it can be concluded that this formulation (AYF-1) has antisecretory activity as well as gastroprotective activity. This synergistic activity in the formulation may be due to presence of multiple herbs. Hence this formulation can be used as antiulcer agent.

The widely popular antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is a potent induced of neural tube defects in human and mouse embryos. Accumulating evidence suggests that its teratogenicity is associated with the potential of causing embryonic generation of free radicals and increased oxidative stress. On the other hand, Spirulina (Sp), is a blue-green alga whose pharmacological properties have been attributed to a great extent to its antioxidant potential. Accordingly, the present study was performed to investigate the influence of Sp on the teratogenicity of VPA in ICR mice and the possible mechanism of action. VPA in the form of sodium valproate was administered intraperitoneally to mice on gestation day (GD) 8 at a dose of 600 mg/kg. Sp was given orally at 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg daily from GD0 through GD18 (at which time the animals were sacrificed). Upon analysis the most common finding in fetuses after VPA exposition was exencephaly. The incidence of this and other malformations was significantly decreased in mice receiving Sp. Moreover, compared to the animals treated orly with VPA, in Sp supplemented mice, embryonic lipid peroxidation proved to be decreased, while the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutation peroxidase were found to be increased. In conclusion, these results illustrate the protective action of Sp through its antioxidant activity in relation to VPA-induced teratogenicity.

Chakradhara Rao US, Shewade D G, Adithan C
Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Pondicherry, India.
Aim:
To investigate the relationship between proguanil metabolic ratio (proguanil/cycloguanil) and CYP2C19 genotype in a South Indian population.
Methods:
Fifty eight South Indians (18-55 years, 42 males, 8 females) were genotyped for CYP2C19 (*2 and *3 alleles) by PCR-RFLP method. The 1.8 kb 5’ flanking region of CYP2C19 was also sequenced, and Subjects were phenotyped for proguanil oxidation by collecting 5ml of blood 4.5 h after taking 200mg of proguanil HCl. Proguanil (PG) and cycloguanil (CG) concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Metabolic ratios (PG/CG) of different genotypes were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-test.
Results:
Of the subjects genotyped, 16 were CYP2C19 *1/*1, 26 were CYP2C19 *1/*2, 6 were CYP2C19 *2/*2, and 2 were CYP2C19*1/*3. The mean PG/ CG ratio (4.726) was lower in the homozygous wild type (*1/*1) subjects compared with that in heterozygous individuals (*1/*2; mean PG/CG = 9.629; P= 0.031) and individuals with homozygous mutant alleles (*2/*2; mean PG/CG= 9.914; p=0.040). There is no significant difference seen in mean PG/CG ratio between homozygous mutant subjects and heterozygous subjects with *2 allele. The promoter region polymorphisms of CYP2C19 shall have influenced the conversion of PG to CG by altering the enzyme transcription.
Conclusion:
CYP2C19 enzyme role in cycloguanil formation in vivo was confirmed by the CYP2C19 gene-dose effect. However, there was substantial overlap of PG/CG ratio in subjects of different CYP2C19 genotypes, suggesting the influence of other variations in the promoter region or contribution of other enzymes to the formation of cycloguanil.

Candidiasis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Earlier reports reveal the antifungal activity (in vitro) of Ocimum sanctum. The present investigations evaluated the anticandidal activity of O.Sanctum. Hydro alcoholic extract of O.sanctum (HEOS) was obtained by cold maceration. The reports of phytochemical investigations found 0.75% of phenolic compounds and 2.5% of flavonoids in HEOS. In vitro investigations of HEOS at the dose range from 1000 to 15.625μg/ml were found to be effective against various fungal strains. Experimental systemic candidiasis was induced in mice by administering through tail vein (0.1ml of 106 cells/ml of culture suspension of C.albicans). The animals were immunocompromised with cyclophosphamide (i.p). Oral administration of HEOS 200 and 400mg/kg body weight for 16 consecutive days showed highest mortality (40%) in untreated mice compared with treated. On day 16 animals were sacrificed and colony forming units (CFU) in various organs were recorded. A highly significant (P<0.01) decrease in CFU was found in HEOS treated mice compared to untreated in both normal and immunocompromised conditions. Histopathology of various organs (liver, kidney, intestine and lungs) exhibited similar results. There was no change in body weights of drug treated mice and a significant increase in total leukocyte count and lymphocytes compared to immunocompromised mice. It indicates hydroalcoholic extract of O.sanctum possess significant anticandidal activity in both normal and immunocompromised mice at tested dose levels and it could be due to bioactive principles like flavonoids and phenolic compounds distributed in HEOS.

Candidiasis is often observed as causal agent of oral and vaginal infections in immunocompromised individuals. Sweet basil species belong to the Ocimum genus and Lamiaceae family has immunomodulatory, antimicrobial and antifungal activity. The present study investigated the anticandidal activity of Ocimum basilicum in normal and immunocompromised mice under gut colonization. Hydroalcoholic extract of Ocimum basilicum (HEOB) was obtained by cold maceration. The quantitative analysis report of HPLC study indicated presence of quercetin (6.22μg/ mg), rosamarnic acid (1.2gμ4/mg), rutin (0.88μg/mg) and eugenol (0.04μg/mg). Experimental systemic candidiasis under gut colonization was induced by administering clindamicin and gentamicin to all the groups for whole duration of experiment and infected by C.albicans (i.v) on the eleventh day. The animals were immunocompromised by i.p injection of cyclophosphamide on day 13 (300mg/kg/bwt) and 15 (150mg/kg/bwt). 200 and 400 mg/kg/ bwt of HEOB administered orally once daily for 24 consecutive days and mortality was observed. High percentage of mortality (40%) was recorded in non treated groups compared with treated. Maximum colonization evidenced in fecal samples and in various organs (liver, kidney, intestine and lungs) of untreated mice. However, a significant (P<0.001) reduction of colony forming units in fecal samples and organs were recorded in HEOB treated mice. Histopathology of various organs exhibited the similar findings. This study concludes that O.basilicum possess significant anticandidal activity in both normal and immunocompromised mice under gut colonization at tested dose levels and it could be due to its bioactive principles like quercetin, rutin, rosmarnic acid and eugenol distributed in HOEB.

K B Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Gandhinagar-382023, India.
The study was designed to investigate the effect of Tephrosia purpurea roots against experimental bronchial asthma models. The ethyl acetate extract was studied in experimental models of asthma like: Mast Cell degranulation by compound 48/80, Histamine induced bronchospasm, Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and Bronchoalveolar lavage study. Dexamethasone (5mg/kg) was used as a reference standard. A significant protection of rat mesenteric mast cells from disruption caused by compound 48/80 was offered by Ethyl acetate extract (100, 250 and 500 μg/ml). The extract also offered significant protection against mast cell disruption caused by antigen. In the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model, pretreatment with ethyl acetate extract significantly reduced the amount of dye leakage, compared to control, at the site of heterogenous antibody injection. Ethyl acetate extract at the doses of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg significantly delayed the onset of convulsions in guinea pigs due to acute bronchospasm induced by histamine aerosols. As compared with unsensitized animals, significant increase in eosinophil and basophil count was observed in untreated- sensitized animals challenged with egg albumin. Ethyl acetate extract (500 mg/ kg) did not produce any significant difference in the count of all the types of WBC detected in the bronchial fluid of sensitized animals compared with untreated sensitized animals. It can be concluded from the study that Ethyl acetate Extract of Tephrosia purpurea roots possesses significant protection against bronchoconstriction and anaphylaxis. Stabilization of mast cells and inhibition of immediate hypersensitivity reactions appear to be involved in its mode of action.

Ramya E, Veeresh PV, Prabhakar KR, Unnikrishnan MK
Manipal College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal – 576 104. Karnataka.
Introduction:
The bark, root and fruits of Ficus racemosa have been claimed to possess antidiabetic activity in traditional ayurvedic system. Thus, the present investigation was carried out to explore possible antidiabetic activity.
Methods:
Powdered bark of Ficus racemosa was extracted with 95% ethanol (Soxhlet) to obtain FRE (ethanolic extract) followed by water extraction to obtain FRW. Type 2 diabetes like condition was induced by a combination of high - fat diet (2 weeks) and single dose of streptozotocin (25mg/kg, i.p) in male wistar rats. Rats with fasting blood glucose levels >200mg/dl after 7 days of STZ were randomized into groups and treated with FRE in graded doses for 15 days. Pioglitazone was used as positive control. After completion of the study, blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance, lipid profiles, serum insulin, enzymatic and non enzymatic liver antioxidant levels were estimated.
Results:
Treatment with FRE (200 and 400mg/kg) reduced blood glucose, serum insulin, lipid levels and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) levels and improved glucose tolerance, suggesting improvement in fat fed/ STZ induced insulin resistance. FRE supplementation decreased oxidative stress by improving endogenous antioxidants. FRE inhibited PTP- 1B with IC50 12.1mcg/ml, alpha-amylase with IC50 1.87mcg/ml and partially inhibited alpha-glucosidase. FRE, at 200mcg/ml showed 42.5% inhibition of DPP IV and at 10mcg/ml showed 82.6% binding to PPAR-gamma. FRE exhibited concentration dependent stimulation of glucose uptake by skeletal muscles (hemidiaphragm).
Conclusion:
Results suggest that ethanolic extract of Ficus racemosa inhibits fat fed/ STZ induced insulin resistance, lipid abnormalities and oxidative stress.

The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of ethanolic extract of Embelia ribes Burm on methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress in rats. Methionine (1 g/kg, per day for 30 days) administration to vehicle control rats produced a significant (P<0.01) increase in homocysteine and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in serum and lipid peroxides (LPO) levels in brain homogenates with concomitant decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels in brain homogenates, as compared to vehicle control rats. Administration of ethanolic Embelia ribes extract (100 and 200 mg/Kg per day for 30 days) to methionine treated hyperhomocysteinemic rats produced significant (P<0.01) decrease in homocysteine and LDH levels in serum. In addition, a significant (P<0.01) decrease in LPO levels and increase in GSH levels was observed in brain homogenates. The results were comparable to that of folic acid, a standard antihyperhomocysteinemic drug. The results of our study, for the first time, provide clear evidence that ethanolic Embelia ribes extract treatment possesses antihyperhomocysteinemic and antioxidant effect against methionine-induced hyperhomocysteinemia and oxidative stress in rat brain.

Introduction:
The leaves of Polycorpaea corymbosa (Family: Caryophyllaceae) are used in Indian traditional medicine for treatment of jaundice. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenolics in the plant. This inspired us to study its antioxidant properties.
Methods:
Aqueous alcoholic (70%) extract obtained by cold maceration of leaves was fractionated into petroleum ether (PCPE), butanol (PCB), ethyl acetate (PCEA) and water (PCWF) fractions. The antioxidant potency of different fractions were evaluated using well established in vitro methods, such as DPPH radical scavenging, Beta Carotene Linoleic Acid Module System (B-CLAMS), Hydroxyl radical (·OH) scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation. Also Total Phenolic Content (TPC) of different fractions was determined.
Results:
Among the different fractions PEA showed highly potent antioxidant activity which is comparable to that of standards. Different standards like Ascorbic acid (ASC), BHT, Mannitol and Silymarin were used in different methods. IC50 values of PEA and standards were found to be 1.38±0.62 and 2.00±0.35 microgram/ml in DPPH radical scavenging activity, 32.5±3.42 and 92.5±4.67 microgram/ml in B-CLAMS method, 5.95±1.39 and 3.25±0.46 microgram/ml in.  OH radical scavenging activity and 13.0±1.28 and 5.9±0.16 microgram/ml in anti-lipid peroxidation assay. Further TPC of PCPE, PCB, PCEA and PCWF were found equivalent to 27.56±3.41, 93.58±2.79, 216.01±5.59 and 32.59±2.79 mg of gallic acid respectively.
Conclusion:
The fraction containing high TPC (PCEA) showed highest antioxidant activity and the fraction containing least TPC (PCWF) showed least antioxidant activity. So it was concluded that total phenolics are responsible for antioxidant activity and ethyl acetate fraction was found to be a potent antioxidant.

Introduction:
Azima tetracantha traditionally used as Antiinflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial also used for arthritic and toothache. This study is to evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of Azima tetracantha ethanolic extract (AZEE) in albino wistar rats.
Method:
Acute anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by Carragenan induced paw edema method using diclofenac as standard. Anti-arthritis activity was evaluated by Freund’s Complete Adjuvant (FCA) induced arthritis. Wistar rats of both sexes weighing about 200-250gm divided into 5 groups of 6 each. AZEE 250-500mg was administred for 12days using dexamethasone as standard. The degree of inflammation was measured by Screw guage on 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 15, 18 and 21days. On 21st day blood samples were collected from all groups for evaluation of Rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein.
Results:
AZEE 250-500mg/kg suppresses the Carragenan induced paw edema significantly at 3 to 4hrs (P<0.05, P<0.01). It’s a “BIPHASIC” response; AZEE 250/500mg significantly suppress paw edema in FCA induced rats (P<0.05, P>0.01). The odema in non-injected paw also suppressed by AZEE during 11th and 16th day. The body weight also improved with AZEE treated group compared with FCA group (P<0.01). Rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein levels are decreased compared with FCA group (P<0.001).
Conclusion:
From the above findings we can conclude that AZEE has anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory activity and it’s confirms the traditional claims. Thus needs further studies to prove the exact mechanism of action.

RandD Centre, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India.
Rumipro, an herbal animal feed supplement for enhancing ruminal functions, was evaluated for its acute oral toxicity by administering as a single oral dose to female albino Wistar rats. Rumipro™ was administered orally in a sequential manner to five female rats at the limit dose level of 5000 mg/kg body weight. On the day of dosing, all the animals were observed for mortality and clinical signs for first 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h after dosing and thereafter twice daily for mortality and once a day for clinical signs, for 14 days. The body weight of rats was recorded and weekly body weight gain was calculated. After the observation period of 14 days, all surviving animals were sacrificed and subjected to complete necropsy. The Rumipro™ treated rats did not show any adverse clinical signs immediately following dosing and during the observation period of 14 days. Treatment with Rumipro™ did not reveal any major adverse effect on the body weight gain, except for three treated animals showing reduced body weight gain during the second week of 14 day observation period as compared to first week. Overall, the percent body weight gain during the complete 14 day observation period was found to be normal in all the treated animals. On necropsy, no major gross pathological changes were observed in any of the treated rats. Based on the findings of the present study, Rumipro™ was found to be safe after oral administration as a single dose to female albino Wistar rats up to 5000 mg/kg body weight.

Introduction:
The seeds of Psoralea corylifolia are indicated for treatment of diabetes in Ayurvedic system of medicine. Hence, it is proposed to evaluate antidiabetic activity of methanolic extract of Psoralea corylifolia seeds in alloxan-induced hyperglycemic rats.
Materials and Methods:
The methanolic extract of Psoralea corylifolia seeds (PCSE) was subjected to phytochemical screening and acute toxicity study. Hyperglycemia was induced in albino Wistar rats by single intravenous administration of alloxan monohydrate (65 mg/kg). Graded doses of PCSE (100, 200, 400 and 800mg/kg) suspended in carboxy methyl cellulose were administered orally to normal and diabetic rats, and to glucose loaded normal rats for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Fasting serum glucose levels were assessed on different time intervals up to 3 h on first day and later on 3rd and 7th day of PCSE treatment. Metformin (500 mg/kg, orally) was used as standard antidiabetic agent.
Results:
PCSE was found to be safe up to 2000 mg/kg, orally (LD50>2000 mg/kg). PCSE treatment caused a significant dose- and time- dependant reduction in serum glucose levels in diabetic rats but not in normal rats. Similar effect was observed with metformin. In OGTT, PCSE suppressed elevated serum glucose levels in normal rats as did metformin.
Conclusion:
PCSE possesses antidiabetic effect. This effect of PCSE may be attributed at least in part to increased glucose metabolism as like other antihyperglycemic plant extracts.

Principal K.M.Kundnani College of Pharmacy., Mumbai, India.
Introduction:
Despite scientific advances in our understanding of hepatotoxicity, and leads provided by traditional system of medicine, we do not yet have any effective entities to cure liver derangement, more importantly those which are caused by a variety of drugs. Boerhaavia diffusa has an established hepatoprotective activity, so such a plant will be easier to evaluate for the potentiating effect if any by piperine.
Materials and Methods:
Dried roots of Boerhaavia diffusa were extracted with 70% ethanol using Soxhlet apparatus. Hepatoprotective activity and subsequent evaluation for potentiation by piperine were carried out by administrating the ethanolic extract p.o. to albino wistar rats as per OECD-423 guidelines. The activity of Boerhaavia diffusa was assessed at two dose levels viz. 150mg/kg and 300 mg/kg. Piperine was used at two doses 10mg and 20mg. Two models were used to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of Boerhaavia diffusa- (i) CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity and (ii) Rifampicin-Isoniazid induced hepatotoxicity. The biochemical parameters estimated for both models were the serum lysosomal enzymes SGOT, SGPT and ALP. Silymarin was used as a reference standard.
Results:
Boerhaavia diffusa showed a significant reduction in levels of the enzymes- SGOT, SGPT, ALP, which were elevated in the toxicant control groups thus showing good hepatoprotective activity. The evaluation of possible potentiation with piperine resulted in a dose dependent potentiation of the activity of Boerhaavia diffusa.
Conclusion:
The present study clearly demonstrates that Boerhaavia diffusa has good hepatoprotective activity in both animal models and its bioactivity is further enhanced in presence of piperine.

Introduction:
Barringtonia racemosa has been reported to possess interesting biological potentials such as anti-tumor, anti-asthamatic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, cytotoxic and anti-bacterial. There is a need to isolate the active components of this plant and screen them for their druggability.
Methods:
Isolation of triterpenoid: The targeted triterpenoid was isolated from Barringtonia racemosa by cold maceration of the powdered fruits of this plant in petroleum ether followed by extraction with methanol. The methanolic extract was fractionated with ethylacetate and was subjected to separation on a silica gel column with varying compositions of ethylacetate and chloroform. The isolation was monitored by TLC by comparing the isolated fractions with the Bartogenic acid as a marker.
Characterization:
The isolated triterpenoid was characterized for its chemical structure through HPTLC, IR, LC-MS and NMR analysis.
Biological activity:
The isolated compound was screened for its biological potentials through following assays;
Paw edema induced by Carrageenan, Histamine and serotonin in rats.
Granuloma induced by cotton pellet implantation in mice
Oxazolone induced ear edema in mice
Arthritis induced by Freund’s Complete Adjuvant in rats
Results and conclusion: The triterpenoid compound isolated by us matched with Bartogenic acid and was found to exert potent antiinflammatory and antiarthritic activity in the animal models. These activities were comparable with the standard drugs used in these study models. It is proposed that the Bartogenic acid is a major constituent responsible for biological potentials of Barringtonia racemosa.

Department of Pharmaceutics, Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.
Introduction:
Livosyp is a polyherbal formulation containing herbs which are known for their hepatoprotective properties in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. In this study, hepatoprotective activity of Livosyp was investigated.
Methods:
Hepatoprotective activity of Livosyp (at 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, p.o.) was investigated in rats through validated models by inducing hepatotoxicity with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4): liquid paraffin (1:1) (2 ml/kg, i.p.) and paracetamol (250 mg/kg, p.o.). The degree of protection was measured by using biochemical parameters like serum transaminases (AST and ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
Results:
The single oral dose of paracetamol and CCl4 produced significantly elevated levels of serum AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin activities. In addition, an increased MDA concentration and decreased catalase and SOD were observed in the hepatic tissues. Livosyp has been shown to lower the elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Livosyp also significantly prevented the elevation of hepatic malondialdehyde formation in the liver of paracetamol and CCl4 intoxicated rats in a dose dependent manner. The decreased activities of catalase and SOD were also restored towards normalization by Livosyp administration. The results were confirmed histopathologically and compared with silymarin (100 mg/kg, p.o.), a standard hepatoprotective agent.
Conclusion:
The lower dose of Livosyp (100 mg/kg) did not produce significant hepatoprotective effect. However, 200 and 300 mg/kg doses of Livosyp have shown significant hepatoprotective activity compared to control while effect of 300 mg/kg dose of Livosyp was comparable qualitatively to silymarin.

Acharya and B.M.Reddy College of Pharmacy, Bangalore-90, India.
Objective:
For scientific validation of polyherbal formulation RD/M.ph.AA-01 evaluated for antinociceptive effect on animals in two different nociceptive induced models and also tested to reveal its mechanism of action.
Methods:
The effect was tested in wistar albino rats by tail immersion method (55±2°C) and acetic acid writhing test in swiss albino mice (20-30 gm) model.
Results:
The antinociceptive effect of RD/Mph-AA01 at the dose of 54 mg/200g.p.o. of rat was not significant but 81 mg/200g.p.o of rat was very significant (P<0.01) in tail immersion model. The percentage increase in reaction time after administration RD/ Mph.AA-01 (81mg/200g) was found to be 64.81, 78.14, 101.38, 67.12 and 27.31 at 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, 180 min and 240 min respectively. The peak antinociceptive effect was observed after 120 min of administration. The antinociceptive effect of RD/Mph. AA-01(81mg/200mg) was completely and significantly (P<0.01) abolished with prior administration of naloxone (2 mg/kg.i.p.).The prior administration of caffeine (16 mg/kg.i.p.) decreased maximum of 55.2% of antinociceptive effect of RD/Ph-AA01 (81mg/200mg) but stastically not significant. The antinociceptive effect of RD/Mph. AA-01 was significant (P<0.01) in writhing test. The percentage inhibition of writhes was 77.71 and 85.7 with RD/Mph.AA-01 at the dose of 7.8mg/20g and 11.7 mg/20g (p.o) respectively. The antinociceptive effect of RD/Mph.AA-01 (11.7 mg/20g) was completely and significantly (P<0.01) abolished with prior administration of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondosetron (0.5mg/ kg.i.p).
Conclusion:
RD/Mph.AA-01 has antinociceptive effect. Opioid, adenosine A1, A2 and 5-HT3 receptors are involved in its antinociceptive effect and inhibition of cytokine production might also account for its effect.

Husain GM, Singh PN, Kumar V
Pharmacology Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutics, Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221 005, India.
Introduction:
Ethnobotanical knowledge played a particularly important role in historical diabetes therapies, with over 1200 species of medicinal plants recognized throughout the world for their ability to treat diabetic indications. Hypericum perforatum contains a variety of biologically active constituents including flavonoids like quercetin which have proved antidaibetic potential. Keeping this background in mind it seems realistic to evaluate Indian Hypericum perfortatum (IHp) for the control of diabetes.
Methods:
Charles foster rats of either sex (~180 g) were used in the present study. Hypoglycemic activity of the standardized extract of IHp (100 and 200 mg/kg) was observed on alloxan induced (120 mg/kg, i.p.) diabetic rats. IHp extract was orally administered as suspension in 0.3 % carboxymethylcellulose for 14 days. Glibenclamide (10 mg/kg/ day, p.o.) was used as standard. Blood samples were collected at 0, 7th and 14th day (1 hour after last dose) from orbital sinus and blood glucose was estimated by commercially available kit. Statistical analyses were performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett Multiple Comparisons Test.
Results and Conclusion:
IHp led to significant fall (P<0.01) in elevated blood glucose level. Moreover, IHp treatment also reverses the weight loss associated with alloxan treatment. The mechanism by which this extract lowers blood glucose is under investigation. The observed blood glucose lowering effect suggests that IHp extract possess active phytochemical principles with hypoglycemic potential.

1Sikkim Manipal Institute of Medical Sciences; 2Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Karnataka, India.
Introduction:
Wound is the breach in the normal tissue continuum, resulting in variety of cellular and molecular scquelae. It can occur as a result of physical, chemical, thermal, electrical, radiational, surgical insult to tissue. Though the number of drugs ranging from the simple analgesic to complex and expensive chemotherapeutic agent administered for wound healing, a large number of world population are inaccessible to such drugs. A large section of population realized on the traditional medicine.
Methods:
During the present investigation, the plant K. galanga, which is widely used medicine in ayurvedic system of medicine, was taken for wound healing properties in Wistar Rat. Three type of wound model (incision, excision and dead space were employed to address all event of the wound healing process.
Results:
The study revealed that the rhizome of K. galanga facilitated epithelialization and reversed the dexamethasone suppressed healing, enhanced wound contraction, increased dry weight of the granulated tissue but did not alter the breaking strength of incision and dead space wound and hydroxyproline content.
Conclusion:
This study shows that the alcoholic extract of rhizomes of K. galanga mainly reverses the dexamethasone suppressed wound healing. This effect can be clinically made useful when healing has been adversely affected especially by drugs like antineoplastics, steroids, NSAIDS in perisurgical period and also to promote healing of leg ulcers, extensive surface burns, healing of donar area in skin graft surgery etc. These suggestions need well designed further clinical evaluation.

S.K. Patel College of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mehsana, India.
Introduction:
Free radicals are implicated for more than 80 diseases including diabetes mellitus, arthritis, cancer, liver diseases, ageing, conditions in which oxidative stress is prominent. In Indian system of medicine Achyranthes aspera is an important medicinal plant and its leaf, seed paste or root juice has been used in various ailments and as health tonic.
Methods:
To understand the mechanisms of pharmacological actions, the in-vitro antioxidant activity of alcoholic and aqueous extracts of leaf, root and seeds of Achyranthes aspera (ALLA, ALRA, ALSA, AQLA, AQRA and AQSA) was investigated for activity of DPPH free radicals, superoxide anion radicals and nitric oxide radicals scavenging assay spectrophotometrically. Ascorbic acid was taken as reference. Total phenolic contents in all extracts were determined by Folin Ciocalteu reagent.
Result:
The highest free radial scavenging activity was found with AQSA. IC50 values of AQSA was found 112.19 ± 2.21, 137.73 ± 2.58, 148.94 ± 3.95 mcg ml-1 in DPPH free radical, superoxide anion radical and nitric oxide radical assay respectively. The antioxidant activity of ALLA, AQLA was also found statistically significant. The total phenolic contents of AQSA, ALSA and AQSA were found 488.21, 386.54 and 413.28 respectively.
Conclusion:
From the results, we infer that antioxidant property of AQSA, ALSA and AQLA may be due to the presence of total phaenolic contents in extracts. These results clearly indicate that Achyranthes aspera is effective against free radical mediated diseases.

1Shri B. M. Shah College of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Modasa, India; 2L.M.College of Pharmacy, Ahmedabad, India.
In the present study, we investigated the effects of aqueous extract of Mucuna pruriens on gentamicin (100 mg kg-1 per day for six days) induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats. GEN-induced nephrotoxicity was evidenced by marked increase in serum urea and creatinine levels and urine volume and decrease in urinary sodium levels and creatinine clearance. M. pruriens extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg in addition to gentamicin caused dose dependant decrease in serum creatinine and urea levels and an increase in creatinine clearance. There was a significant increase in the urinary sodium levels by M. pruriens extract at a dose of 400 mg/kg but not at the dose of 200 mg/ kg when compared with GEN control rats. Treatment with M. pruriens extract at a dose of 400 mg mg/kg further increased the urine volume as compared to GEN control rats. However, further increase in urine volume by M. pruriens extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg was not significant. Renal oxidative stress was determined by renal lipid peroxides levels, glutathione (GSH) levels and by enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). GEN caused significant increase in lipid peroxide levels and significant decrease in GSH levels and SOD and CAT activity. M. pruriens extract significantly and dose-dependently reduced lipid peroxidation and enhanced GSH levels and SOD and CAT activities. Our data suggest that M. pruriens extract has protective potential against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats.

The role of oxidative stress and ROS generation has been proved in the pathogenesis of liver damage. ROS initiate auto oxidation of cellular membrane lipids can lead to cellular necrosis thus they are well known to be cytotoxic and have been implicated in the etiology of hepatotoxicity and possibly represent the hepatotoxic principle of alcohol and various drugs. In this present study, we have assessed acute oral toxicity of aqueous-alcoholic extract of fruits of Pedalium murex on female Swiss albino mice by AOT 425 guideline. Hepatoprotective activity of aqueous-alcoholic extract of fruits of Pedalium murex (200, 400 mg/kg) was carried out using alcohol (40% ethanol) and isoniazide induced liver damage in wistar albino female rats. In same models, we have measured free radical scavenger enzymes (SOD, Catalase) level. Aqueousalcoholic extract of fruits of Pedalium murex did not show any mortality up to 5000 mg/kg. Significant hepatoprotective activity at 400 mg/kg dose of aqueous-alcoholic extract was observed in alcohol and isoniazide induced liver damage. All the elevated liver biochemical parameters (SGPT, SGOT, TB, TG and TC) in alcohol and isoniazide intoxicated rats decreased significantly near to normal level by aqueous-alcoholic extract of fruits of Pedalium murex. Photomicrograph of liver sections also has shown hepatoprotective activity. SOD and Glutathione level was significantly increased and Lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced with 400 mg/kg dose of aqueous-alcoholic extract of fruits of Pedalium murex. Flavonoids and tannins present in aqueousalcoholic extract may responsible for hepatoprotective action by scavenging free radicals.

The leaves of Moringa oleifera Lam (Moringaceae) have anti-diabetic, anti-tumor and used for the treatment of cardio vascular and liver diseases by traditional healers in India. The several published reports support the same. The present study investigated the lipid lowering effect of the leaves of plant Moringa oleifera in poloxamer- 407 (1g/kg/b.wt) and high fat diet induced hyperlipidemic rats. The experimental animals were divided into five groups of male Wistar rats each. The results indicate that oral administration of hydro alcoholic extract of Moringa oleifera (HEMO) at two different dose level (100 and 200 mg/kg/b.wt) showed significant (P<0.001) reduction in elevated levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins and similarly significant (P<0.001) increase in high density lipoproteins level in both poloxamer-407 and high fat diet induced hyperlipidemic rats. Atherogenic index was significantly reduced in the Moringa oleifera treated groups at tested dose levels. Histopathology reports of liver and aorta evidence the similar finding. The quantitative analysis of HEMO by using LC-MS indicated the presence of 0.09% β-sitosterol. It suggests that β-sitosterol is a bioactive phyto principle in the leaves of Moringa oleifera, may be responsible for its lipid lowering effect and it can be prescribed as food supplement for coronary artery disease patients along with their regular lipid lowering therapy.

Introduction:
These days in the developed as well as developing countries, herbal medicines are in great demand because of their wide biological activities, higher safety margin and lesser costs than the synthetic drugs. Cichorium intybus Linn.(Kashni) has been advocated in traditional system of medicine for the treatment of liver disorders. In the present study, extract of Kasni was evaluated for its prophylactic activity against acute hepatocellular damage induced in albino mice.
Materials and Methods:
Ethanolic extract of Kashni was administered at three dose levels (50, 100 and 200mg/100g/ day) for five days to albino mice. Hepatic damage was induced by acetaminophen (500mg/kg, single dose). Serum ALT levels were estimated biochemically and liver sections were subjected to histopathological studies.
Result:
Significant rise (***P<0.001) was observed in serum ALT levels in mice after administration of acetaminophen. Extract of Kashni, when administered in different doses prophylactically for five days before administration of acetaminophen, produced a dose dependent fall in the enzyme levels, the decrease being significant (P<0.05and P<0.001) with 100 and 200mg/100g doses, respectively. Histopathological studies revealed marked regenerative activity in the livers at the three doses of the extract.
Conclusion:
It is concluded that Cichorium intybus has significant prophylactic antihepatotoxic activity as it lowers the ALT levels in mice in which hepatotocellular damage was induced by acetaminophen and increases the regenerative activity of liver cells.

University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India.
Introduction:
Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna), an Indian Medicinal Plant, has been known for the treatment of angina and other cardiac ailments. This study investigates the effect of T. arjuna in animal models of nociception.
Methods:
The antinociceptive activity was determined by tail flick latency test and formalin –induced pain response in mice. T.arjuna was administered orally in doses of 400 and 800mg/kg, p.o 1hr before the nociceptive stimulus. In a separate series of experiments, mice were pretreated with morphine for three days in increasing doses (10, 15, 20mg/kg, i.p.), and the antinociceptive responses to morphine (5mg/kg, i.p.) and T. arjuna (800mg/kg, p.o.) were observed in morphine tolerant animals.
Results:
T. arjuna (400mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the duration of licks and bites in both phases of formalin-induced pain response. Tail flick latency test showed significant increase at higher dose of T.arjuna (800mg/kg, p.o.).These effects were antagonised by pre-treatment with naloxone..In morphine tolerant mice, cross tolerance was observed with T.arjuna (800mg/kg, p.o.) administration.
Conclusion:
The effect appears to be mediated by opoidergic mechanism as the antinociceptive effect of T.arjuna was antagonised by naloxone and there was cross tolerance to T.arjuna, in morphine tolerant mice. Thus T. arjuna can be said to possess antinociceptive potential.

Traditional Medicine (TM) is widely followed throughout the world especially in Asian and African countries. In Nepal apart from the ethnic folk medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and Tibetan medicine have rich heritage of over many centuries and major population is still relying on them. These systems use crude products of plants, animals and minerals as medication. In the present work, we have studied the traditional systems of medicines practiced in the western Nepal according to the crude drugs used and their formulations. For this firstly using the Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey method, we studied the status and popularity of the traditional medicines in comparison to the modern medicine in the selected villages of our study area which lie in the temperate and sub-alpine region of western Nepal. Then the short listed crude drugs which included mainly the Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (MAPs) were collected, identified and preserved. Alongside we documented the indigenous knowledge obtained from the locals including the traditional medical practitioners (Baidyas, Amchis, Lamas Dhamis and Jhankris) and the tribal elders regarding the use of the crude drugs. More than hundred crude drugs and over fifty specific formulations were documented. We believe that the study would help in the scientific exploration of the traditional knowledge. Dissemination of thus achieved knowledge, discussion on the conservation, appropriate use and the possibility of the discovery of potential new drugs from the crude drugs studied can also be achieved and indicated from this work.

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of insulin and its combination with resveratrol or curcumin on TGF-beta levels in experimental model of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ in rats. After 4 weeks of STZ injection, rats were divided into seven groups: the control rats, diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with insulin (10 IU/kg/s.c) or resveratrol (20mg/kg/p.o.) or curcumin (60mg/kg/p.o.) per se and the combination of resveratrol or curcumin with insulin, from week four uptil week eight. At the termination of the experiments, the renal function tests, oxidative stress markers malonaldehyde and glutathione levels and the anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured in kidney homogenate. STZ-injected rats showed significant increases in blood glucose, polyuria, proteinuria and a decrease in body weight compared with age-matched control rats. After 8 weeks, diabetic rats exhibited renal dysfunction along with a marked increase in oxidative stress, as determined by lipid peroxidation and activities of key antioxidant enzymes. Diabetic animals also exhibited a significant increase in TGF-beta levels. Chronic treatment with insulin and its combination with resveratrol and curcumin significantly attenuated renal dysfunction and oxidative stress in diabetic rats. There was a significant inhibition of TGF-beta release when these drugs were given in combination as compared to their effects per se. These results indicate an anti-oxidative mechanism of resveratrol and curcumin and point towards the beneficial effect of these combinations for their renoprotective action.

The kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) is well known for its anti-oxidant ingredient in it. In this study, we investigated the anti-oxidant effects of kiwi extracts on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced liver injury in BALB/c mice. Radical scavenging effects of 80% methanol extracts of three kinds of kiwi, Halla-Gold, Zesi-sweet, and Zespri, were observed using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction method. In addition, inhibititory activity of extracts for lipid peroxidation was examined using thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay. For animal study, antioxidant potential of kiwi extracts were examined in BALB/c mice by inducing liver injury with carbon tetrachloride. Intraperitoneal administration of CCl4 resulted in significantly elevated plasma levels of alanine aminotrans ferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in control group. However, when mice were pretreated with the kiwi extracts, ALT and AST levels in plasma were decreased. In the liver, kiwi extracts had strong antioxidative activity in the MDA production and in the glutathione level. Moreover, anti-oxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) and glutathione reductase were restored in kiwi extracts treatment groups. Histopathological features were restored in kiwi extracts treated groups compared with those of CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity group.
On the basis of the results obtained it can be concluded that the kiwi showed a certain protective effect through not only the antioxidant, but also the activities in CCl4-intoxicated mice.

Introduction:
Alterations in various biochemical constituents like glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL and adiponectin in blood of diabetic patients signifies the development of insulin resistance. Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin abundantly found in red grapes, tomatoes and peanuts is beneficial in lipid metabolism and increases insulin secretion. In view of this, present study was designed to investigate the effect of chronic administration of resveratrol on biochemical changes associated with insulin resistance.
Methods:
Insulin resistance was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by exposure to high fructose diet for 21 days followed by food deprivation for 24 hrs. Animals received the resveratrol (15 μg/kg, i.p.) daily for 21 days. Blood samples were collected on 22nd day by retro-orbital route and analyzed for glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL and adiponectin blood levels using the respective estimation kits.
Results:
Resveratrol treated rats showed a significant decrease in the blood glucose and triglycerides levels while it increased the HDL and adiponectin levels as compared to the fructose fed group. It also significantly reduced the body weight in high fructose fed rats compared to control rats.
Conclusion:
The present study demonstrates that increase in adiponectin levels by resveratrol treatment increases insulin sensitivity. At the same time, increased glucose and triglyceride levels which contribute to insulin resistance were also decreased significantly. In conclusion, the present study indicates resveratrol administration or consumption of resveratrol rich food may offer a better therapeutic approach for the treatment of insulin resistance.

Neuropharmacology Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi-29, India.
Background:
Cough is the most common symptom of respiratory diseases. When cough becomes serious, opioids are effective, but they have side effects like sedation, constipation, some addiction liability and also compromise the respiratory function. Therefore, there is need to have effective anti-tussive agent which do not have respiratory suppressant activity. The present study was carried out to evaluate anti-tussive activity of combination of herbal drugs in sulphur dioxide (SO2) induced cough model in mice.
Materials and Methods:
The experiments were performed on mice of either sex, weighing 25-35g. The mice screened for number of cough bouts after exposure to SO 2 in a dessicator and those showing 60+10 cough bouts in five minutes served as normal control. Mice were randomly divided in to 7 experimental groups (n=6). Group 1 as normal control, group 2 were given distilled water, group 3 as positive control received codeine sulphate (10mg/kg, p.o.) and group 4, 5, 6, 7 received coded herbal drugs I, II, III. IV respectively at a dose of 0.3ml/ mice, orally, using feeding canula and 20 minutes latter were exposed to sulphur dioxide again for 45 sec. The mice were then placed in an observation chamber for counting of cough bouts by two independent observers. Readings are mean of these two observations and from this percent inhibition in number of cough bouts was calculated.
