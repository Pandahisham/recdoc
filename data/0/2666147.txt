The purpose of this paper is to review the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of penetrating bladder injuries suffered by civilians in the Iraqi war zone.  Materials and Methods.  All civilian trauma cases received alive at Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital from January 2005 to August 2006 were reviewed for the presence of bladder injury. Results. 533 cases of penetrating abdominal trauma were identified, of which 177 (33%) involved the genitourinary (GU) system and 64 (12%) involved the bladder. Most (70%) were young males, and most (55%) had grade IV injuries. Associated injuries occurred in 63/64 (98%) of patients. 3 patients had missed bladder injuries, and all of these had complications related to their missed injury. Bladder-related complications occurred in 11% of cases, and mortality in 13%, all due to extravesical injuries.  Conclusions. Penetrating bladder injury among civilians in Baghdad war zone resulted in 64 cases in 18 months. The initial detection rate is very high (98%), and after primary repair, lasting complications are rare. Morbidities from missed injuries were severe hematuria and vesicorectal fistula. However, (3%) of vesicorectal fistulae healed spontaneously with prolonged bladder drainage. Associated injuries are the rule in penetrating bladder injury patients, and must be diligently investigated and treated.

The rate of wartime bladder injuries hasstayed remarkably constant, at 15%–20%, over thelast 60 years between World War II and the modern conflicts in the Balkans andthe Gulf (1991) [1–3]. However, in the 21st century,near-universal use of body armor seems to have decreased the incidence of allgenitourinary (GU)injuries in US soldiers to a very low percent 2% [4]. Civilians without body armorstill have high rates of abdominal GU injuries and are though more susceptiblethan military personnel to bladder injuries. We have endeavored to describe oursignificant experience with 64 wartime bladder injuries among a civilianpopulation in a warthat torn Iraqduring the years 2005-2006.
In peacetime, research and writingscompleted by civilian surgeons often educate the military surgeons as to the best practices. Inwartime, the large numbers of  the wounded allow military surgeons to advise civilianpractitioners on improvements in the trauma field. It is in this spirit that wereport these data, in order to improve peacetime and wartime understanding ofthe best care of penetrating bladder injuries which were obtained in peacetime.
From January 2005to August 2006, all abdominal trauma cases received alive in the EmergencyDepartment at Al-Yarmouk Hospital, which is one of the primary sites in Baghdad  for acutemanagement of civilian trauma, were reviewed for penetrating bladder injury.
 Injuries were staged using the AmericanAssociation for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury severity scale [5].  The mechanism of injury aswell as the number and severity of associated injuries were noted.  
All patients were managed in theEmergency Department with resuscitation, evaluation of bladder injury whenFoley catheter was installed diagnosing hematuria. Sometimes those patientshave frank wound(s) in the suprapubic areawhile others diagnosed duringabdominal exploration and if time and clinical condition permitted, imagingstudies were done as X-ray of pelvis occasionally cystogram. Urgent surgicalexploration was performed in most cases since we were dealing with multiorgan-injuredtrauma victim patients with life-threatening concomitant injuries.
When bladder injury was encountered orlooked for during laparotomy (if expected according to injury type andabdominal wound site), the principle was to repair the bladder with properdrainage. Through midline exploratory cystostomy, bladder walls, distalureters, and bladder neck were all explored, avoiding as possible to interferewith any pelvic hematoma. Ureters were assessed by retrograde passage ofureteric catheters, in case of facing difficulties; exploration was done with repair orreimplantation according to thesite of ureteric injury. Bladder injury site(s) was closed after limiteddebridement of any devitalized tissue with two layers of absorbable suturematerial. Difficult sites at bladder neck or trigone were managed in some caseswith one-layer suturing from within.
Inrectal involvement cases, debridement and selective separation of the organwalls were performed, to be sutured separately with interposition of omentum orany other available viable tissue if possible. We always tried to avoid overlappingsuture lines, and together with colostomy, proper drainage of the area wasdone. All other injurieswere dealt with accordingly. Transurethral Foley 2 way catheter of size 18–22 Fr was theroutine way of postoperative drainage. Suprapubic cystostomy catheter was addedin severely injured bladder where the repair was thought to be incomplete. Catheters were kept for 10–14 days accordingto injury assessment, and in some cases cystography preceded the removalespecially for those with multiple bladder injuries and difficult bladder neck and/ortrigone closure. Broadspectrum antibiotic cover was used to all patients starting from the Emergency Department.  There was limited use of anticholinergic medications since in the majorityof cases there was concomitant bowel injury.
SPSS version 11.5(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA) was used for data entry andanalysis. Chi-squaretest of association was used whenever applicable. P value of less or equal to .05 wasconsidered significant.
533 cases ofpenetrating abdominal trauma were identified, including 482 (89%) males and 51 (11%)females. Ages ranged from 4 to 60 years (median age 28) (Figure 1). 177 (33%) injuriesinvolved the GU system and 64 (12%) involved the bladder. These 64patients represented 36% of thepatients with GU injury.  
All penetrating bladder injurieswere due to bullets from pistols, rifles, and/or machine guns (78%), or shellsfrom explosive devices (22%). No knife wounds were seen. 55% of the injurieswere grade IV or higher (Figure 2) with equal involvement of the dome (38%) andlateral wall (36%) (Figure 3). Concomitant injuries occurred in all but 1 ofthe injured bladder patients (Figure 4).
Of the 64 bladder-injuredpatients, the bladder injury was identified and repairedsurgically duringabdominal exploration in 60 (94%). Supravesical drainage was needed only in severecases. Four cases (6%) were treated conservatively. Of these 4 patients, 3had bladder injuries that were missed during surgical exploration. These 3were grade III extraperitoneal injuries. The only case that was managedconservatively bychoice was a grade 1 injury proved by cystography andassociated with lower limb injury.
Of the 64 bladder-injuredpatients, 49 (77%) suffered no significant morbidity.  8/64 (13%) died within 24 hours of injury,usually due to severe bleeding and grave-associated injuries, rather than fromthe bladder injury itself. Major vascular injuries were found in 5 (63%) of thepatients who died.
Seriouscomplications occurred in 7 of 64 (11%) cases (Figure 5). Of these 7 cases,3 had severe hematuria causing drainage problems and requiring bloodtransfusions; 2 had vesicorectal fistulae which healed with conservativemanagement; 2 had urethral strictures, from concomitant urethral trauma. Of the3 cases of missed bladder injury, 2 had severe hematuria and one had avesicorectal fistula.  
Mortality in this bladder-injuredpopulation was significantly associated with concomitant vascular (P = .0002)and chest (P = .003) injuries. Increased complications were related tothose cases where injuries were missed compared to operatively repaired cases (P = .0001).
Civil violence in Iraq  has reached epidemic levels duringthe last 4 years, and increasing numbers of urological injuries are being seenamong unprotected civilians. In this study, urologic injuries occurred in 33%(n  =  177) of 533 penetrating abdominal injury patients, a high incidence thatmight be expected when dealing with civilians not wearing body armor. Of thesepatients with urologic injury, 36% had bladder injury, representing 12% of theentire population of patients with abdominal penetrating injury.
The incidence of GU tract injuries reportedin civilians is generally lower or comparable to that seen here. Civilianpenetrating injuries to the bladder occurred in 11% of 155 victims withpenetrating abdominal wounds seen in one US study [6], while during unrest in Belfastover a 10-year period, only 76 of such injuries were reported [7]. Some civilian series reportbladder injuries in less than 5% of gunshot victims [6, 8].
Older series describing wartime bladderinjury rates are also comparable to that seen in our civilian population here. InVietnam and Croatia, bladder injuries occurred in 15% of those with GU injury [4, 8] and among 92 reported abdominal wounds in the Korean conflict; the bladder wasinvolved in 11% of cases [8]. Bladder injury cases inKuwait during the first Gulf War (1991) were 11% of  all GU injuries among Iraqi wounded and 17%among US wounded [9, 10]. However, in modern conflictsin which body armor is universally used, the rate of bladder injuries is wellbelow 2% [4].
The majority of the affected victims inour study were males (89%), reflecting the same male predominance in civilianpenetrating abdominal injuries series (reported to be between 81% and 87%) [6, 10, 11].
In our study, 78% of the cases were causedby high velocity bullets, with only 22% from shells and explosives. Among USsoldiers in the Iraq war, just the opposite was found, with 83% of the GUinjuries due to fragmentation injuries and mines [9, 12].
In our series, all penetrating bladdercases were associated with injuries to other organs, which coincide with resultreported widely in literature [4–6, 8–11, 13]. Bullets caused injury to a greater number of intra-abdominal organs compared toexplosive fragment wounds (2.05 versus 1.56 organs per patient), which alsocoincided with what has been reported in literature [14].
Bladder injuriescommonly co-occur with colon/rectal injuries. In one series, bladder injuries occurredin 13% of penetrating rectal injuries [15],and in another, 1/3 of patients with extraperitoneal rectosigmoid gunshotwounds had bladder involvement [10]. In our series, the colon wasinjured in 33% and the rectum injured in 22% of the bladder trauma cases. Ingeneral, they were successfully managed, as no significant increase in mortalitywas found. In this study and others, small and large bowels were also commonly injured, withrates reaching 34% and 33% for small and large bowels, respectively [6, 8, 9]. Urethral injury was found in 3% of the cases.
Major vascular injuries accompanied 9% ofour bladder cases. It was found to be statistically a significant cause of death in 63% of thedead cases. This factor represents the major impact on mortality rates indifferent studies [6, 16].
We had ureteric involvement in 4 (6%)cases, while it is usually found in 4%–6% of all urologicalinjuries [9]. Three of our cases werediscovered during surgery and treated with immediate reimplantation, while thefourth one was missed, and reimplantation was done successfully later.
Our surgical technique reflects what is routinely done in many studies [5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17],except that we used only suprapubic drainage in more severe and massive bladderinjuries, and no damage control principles were required. Complicationsoccurred in 7 out of the 64 bladder injuries (11%), representing 5% of thesurgically repaired cases, and appeared lower than rates described elsewherewhich can range as high as 33% [6, 9].  Complications occurred in all 4 missed andconservatively treated injuries. Of the 3 cases of missed bladder injury, 2 hadsevere hematuria and one had a vesicorectal fistula while the only case ofconservative management was accompanied by severe hematuria. Higher complication rates in cases treated conservatively have been describedpreviously [5]. The complication ofhematuria and rectal fistula healed spontaneously, and this coincides withother studies [5, 6, 9, 10].
One of the vesicorectal fistulaeresulted from partial dehiscence of repair of concomitant bladder and rectalinjuries which was evident clinically and radiographically at end of the first postoperative week,while the other one resulted from missed bladder and rectal injuries diagnosedat the fifth postoperative day by the same way. Healing of vesicorectal fistula was achieved byprolonged bladder drainage by transurethral catheterization formore than2 weeks (up to 1 month) depending on the size of the fistula, nothing bymouth, IV fluid;  antibiotic cover and follow up cystography.
We did not see inour study chronic complications like bladder neck stenosis, erectiledysfunction, and overactive bladder symptoms such as what have been described elsewhere and caninvolve between 5% and 21% of cases [5].
Mortality rate after isolated bladderinjury has plummeted over the last century. Mortality rates dropped from 35% in the 1930s [11] to 16% during 1940s [6], then to 10% in the Korean War [8], reaching 1.3% in civilianabdominal injuries in the sixties [6]. However, mortality rate in bladderinjuries patients with other associated severe injuries can still reach highlevels between 12% and 22% [5, 18]. This reflects the severityof the associated injuries rather than the bladder injury itself. Most of thismortality is due to vascular injury, and death rates are reportedly much higherin those with longer evacuation times, reflecting the risk of exsanguinationsafter these types of injury [4, 7–9, 16, 18].
In our study, mortality rate was 13%, deathoccurred in all cases within 24 hours of injury, and major vascular injurieswere found in 63% of these victims. Both vascular and associated chest injurieswere statistically associated with higher mortality rate in our series. The gradeof bladder injury was not found statistically related to mortality rate,reflecting the fact thatdeath is related to other organs injured rather than the bladder itself. Bullets were responsible for 75% of injuries, indicating the higher incidenceof major vascular injuries with bullet wounds (20% versus 9%) which ultimatelyended with greater mortality rates (7% versus 2%) [14].
The incidence of urologicalinjury is high in unprotected civilian victims of wartime injuries in modern Baghdad. The majority of penetratingbladder injuries were associated with concomitant organ injury, and severeblood loss and death were not uncommon. Management of bladder or indeed any GUinjury should emphasize investigation for concomitant injury.
Complications aregenerally uncommon, and most often resolve spontaneously.  Even some severe complications such asvesicorectal fistula heal with prolonged urinary drainage. Missed injuries havea higher complication rate, so it is important to accurately screen for bladderinjuries in a penetrating trauma population. Suprapubic tubes are occasionallyrequired after primary bladder repair of severe and massive bladderinjury. Wartime series such as this can help toadvise civilian trauma surgeons as to the best practices through the vast experiencewhen dealing with such multiorgan-injuredpatients especially in the unique challenges of Iraq's situation in which thereis deficiency of experienced trauma surgeons, and a lot of the difficult workis dealt with by junior residents, in addition to deficiency in equipments. Yet, one can only salute the great job which is done every day, by unknownsoldiers; those are the Iraqi doctors and medical personals on the line of firein Baghdad  hospitals.
