Notes about morphological features of the Western Hemisphere subtribe Ardistomina, and revision of genusSemiardistomis Kult (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Scaritinae, Clivinini)

Academic editor: Terry Erwin
Comparisons of structural features (principally mouthparts, elytral-abdominal locking mechanism, and female genitalia) of the ardistomine genera (Aspidoglossa Putzeys, Ardistomis Putzeys, and Semiardistomis Kult) with those features of members of the subtribe Clivinina (Clivina Latreille, Oxydrepanus Putzeys, Schizogenius Putzeys,Ancus Putzeys, Nyctosyles Putzeys, and Obadius Burmeister) confirm the taxonomic validity of the subtribe Ardistomina. Based on morphological features, the ardistomine genera are postulated to be related as follows: [Aspidoglossa [Ardistomis + Semiardistomis]]. Knowledge of this subtribe is further extended by taxonomic treatment of the genus Semiardistomis Kult. Of the 30 valid names of Semiardistomis previously recognized, four were proposed as variety names, and are listed as junior synonyms: Ardistomis labialis picipes Bates, 1881, Ardistomis labialis nanus Bates, 1881, and Ardistomis labialis dilatatus Bates, 1881; and Ardistomis pallipes caerulea Putzeys, 1846. Eight names, treated as specific epithets, are junior synonyms, as follows: Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) balthasari Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis glabratus (Putzeys, 1866); Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) emdeni Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis deletus (Putzeys, 1846); Ardistomis aenea Putzeys, 1866, Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) brittoni Kult, 1950, and Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) marani Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis flavipes (Dejean, 1831); Ardistomis tuspanensis Putzeys, 1846 = Semiardistomis labialis (Chaudoir, 1837); Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) vlastae Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis subglabra (van Emden, 1949); and Ardistomis striga Putzeys, 1866 = Semiardistomis pallipes (Dejean, 1831). Two new species described are Semiardistomis exspectatussp. n.(type locality PERU, Madre de Dios, Rio Manu, 11°56'47" S, 071°17'00" W), and Semiardistomis majorsp. n. (type locality PERU, Loreto, Rio Samiria, 05°12'S, 75°20'W). The 20 species of Semiardistomis are arranged intwo species–groups here proposed: the puncticollis group, including 12 species; and labialis group, including eight species. The species recognized are keyed, described or redescribed, and notes are provided about their Geographical distribution, habitat and activity. Distribution maps show known geographical ranges, from which are inferred patterns of speciation from a center of radiation in northern South America of both lineages.
La comparación de las características estructurales (principalmente partes bucales, mecanismo de cierre élitro- abdominal y genitalia femenina) de los géneros ardistominos (Aspidoglossa Putzeys, Ardistomis Putzeys, y Semiardistomis Kult) con sus similares de miembros de la subtribu Clivinina (Clivina Latreille, Oxydrepanus Putzeys, Schizogenius Putzeys, Ancus Putzeys, Nyctosyles Putzeys, y Obadius Burmeister) confirma la validez taxonómica de la subtribu Ardistomina. Basado en características morfológicas, se postula una relación entre los géneros ardistominos de forma: [Aspidoglossa [Ardistomis + Semiardistomis]]. El tratado taxonómico del género Semiardistomis Kult extiende el conocimiento de esta subtribu. De los 30 nombres válidos previamente reconocidos, cuatro estaban propuestos como variedades, y se tratan como sinónimos: Ardistomis labialis picipes Bates, 1881, Ardistomis labialis nanus Bates, 1881, y Ardistomis labialis dilatatus Bates, 1881; y Ardistomis pallipes caerulea Putzeys, 1846. Ocho nombres usados como epítetos específicos resultan los siguientes sinónimos: Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) balthasari Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis glabratus (Putzeys, 1866); Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) emdeni Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis deletus (Putzeys, 1846); Ardistomis aenea Putzeys, 1866, Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) brittoni Kult, 1950, y Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) marani Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis flavipes (Dejean, 1831); Ardistomis tuspanensis Putzeys, 1846 = Semiardistomis labialis (Chaudoir, 1837); Ardistomis (Semiardistomis) vlastae Kult, 1950 = Semiardistomis subglabra (van Emden, 1949); y Ardistomis striga Putzeys, 1866 = Semiardistomis pallipes (Dejean, 1831). Las dos especies nuevas descritas son Semiardistomis exspectatussp. n. (localidad tipo PERU, Madre de Dios, Rio Manu, 11°56'47" S, 071°17'00" W), y Semiardistomis majorsp. n. (localidad tipo PERU, Loreto, Rio Samiria, 05°12'S, 75°20'W). Las 20 especies de Semiardistomis se distribuyen en dos grupos de especies aquí establecidos: el grupo puncticollis con 12 especies y el grupo labialis con 8. Las especies reconocidas son incluidas en una clave de identificación, se describen o redescriben, y se dan notas a cerca de su distribución, hábitat y actividad. Los mapas de distribución muestran los rangos geográficos conocidos, de los cuales se infieren patrones de especiación a partir de un centro de radiación en el Norte de Suramérica para ambos linajes.

N’ayant vu qu’un seul individu, j’ignore si ces différences sont constantes et si l’insecte ne constitue pas une variété de l’A. pallipes.
(Putzeys, 1846: 646)
Between these extremes, however, there is, either in the same or other localities, every grade of variation
(Bates, 1881: 35)
The species of this group are very difficult to determine without preparing a key; they form some slightly different subspecies in some localities.
(Kult, 1950: 317)
Although the major part of this paper treats the species of Semiardistomis, a more general background is provided by a preliminary treatment of the subtribe Ardistomina and comparison with other taxa of the tribe Clivinini, principally the nominotypical subtribe Clivinina. Many scaritid genera were included in the Ardistomina, but Bousquet (2006) restricted the subtribe to the genera Ardistomis, Semiardistomis and Aspidoglossa Putzeys; additional evidence presented in this work supports recognition of the group.
The quotations above provide an idea of past taxonomic difficulties regarding members Semiardistomis. Interpretations made using non-diagnostic characters from short series of specimens have led to a taxonomic system, mostly useless, in order to identify and correlate beetles of this genus. The first arrangement of the group was made by Putzeys (1866) who recognized common characters to designate his “deuxieme groupe” of genus Ardistomis Putzeys. Despite that, he placed the North American species of Semiardistomis Kult in a separate group; this structure started recognition of the group as a different entity from its generic origin.
Kult (1950) corroborated Putzeys’ taxonomic structure, naming the “deuxieme groupe” as subgenus Semiardistomis, which was divided into 8 groups, and the “troisieme groupe” as subgenus Ardistomiellus. Kult’s structure was built using characters that proved to be superficial, so species with different origin were placed in the same group. This new scheme resulted also in inclusion of some species of the genus Ardistomis in Semiardistomis, a mistake followed by subsequent authors until Valdes (2009) made the necessary corrections.
Whitehead [in Reichardt (1977)] suggested treating Semiardistomis as a distinct genus, but no formal action was taken until Nichols (1988b) did so. The last published list of species names of Semiardistomis was compiled by Lorenz (2005).

Dissections of adults were made using standard techniques. The genitalia were preserved in glycerin in a microvial, pinned beneath the specimen from which they were removed. Mouthparts were glued on small cards pinned beneath the specimens. Observations were made using a stereobinocular microscope and a compound microscope. All line drawings were made from digital microphotographs using Corel Draw 13X.
The following measurements were made using an ocular micrometer: head length (HL): linear distance from apical margin of clypeus to posterior margin of right eye; length of pronotum (PL): linear distance from anterior to posterior margin along the midline; pronotal width (PW): greatest linear transverse distance; elytral length (EL): linear distance from basal ridge to apex along the suture; elytral width (EW): greatest linear transverse distance across both elytra. The standardized body length (SBL) is the sum of the lengths of head, pronotum and elytra. Body ratios (PW/EW, PW/PL, PL/EL and EW/EL) are given for each species. Mandible proportion is interpreted from ratio of the length of the transverse line at outer molar point (width) and length of the perpendicular distance from that line to apical edge (length).
Most terms used for structural features are found in previous works on Carabidae: Allen and Ball (1980) for adult microsculpture; Acorn and Ball (1991) for adult mandibles; Liebherr and Will (1998) for female genitalia.
Within the Clivinini. the subtribe Ardistomina is characterized as follows: Elytron latero-distally (Fig. 22) with a plica (ep) and an adjacent abdominal (segment VII) pleural projection (app) that together form an elytral-abdominal locking mechanism; ovipositor (Figs 27–30) with an asetose quadranguloid laterotergite, and unsegmented gonocoxa bearing at apex few long setae.
This subtribe includes Aspidoglossa Putzeys, Semiardistomis Kult, and Ardistomis Putzeys.
Mandibles, labium, and female genitalia (source of many diagnostic features within the tribe Clivinini) were compared within the ardistomines and between that subtribe and selected members of the nominotypic Clivinina. The latter taxon was represented by Western Hemisphere members of six exemplar genera: Clivina Latreille, Oxydrepanus Putzeys, Schizogenius Putzeys, Ancus Putzeys, Nyctosyles Putzeys, and Obadius Burmeister. Also, mandibles of Dyschiriodes Jeannel (subtribe Dyschiriina) were included.
Mandibles: Compared to those of Dyschiriina (Figs 12A–12D), the mandibles of the clivinines (Figs 9A–9D to 11A–11D) and ardistomines (Figs 6A–6D to 8A–8D) are relatively straight.
For dentition, Dyschiriodes exhibits the least number of occlusal teeth. The clivinine genera Clivina (Figs 9A–9D)and Oxydrepanus (Figs 10A–10D), and the ardistomine genera Aspidoglossa (Figs 8A–8D) and Ardistomis (Figs 7A–7D)have a full complement of occlusal teeth, Semiardistomis (Figs 6A–6D) and Schizogenius (Figs 11A–11D) lack the premolar tooth.
In values for L/W (a measure of relative length), the mandibles of clivinines, dyschiriines, and the ardistomine Aspidoglossa are relatively short (L/W 1.44–1.68), whereas the mandibles of the ardistomine genera Semiardistomis (L/W 1.86) and Ardistomis (L/W 2.25) are relatively long, with a slender terebra.
Labium: In form, the mentum (m) is markedly to slightly transverse (L/W 0.43–0.56) among the clivinine genera (Figs 17A–21A); among the ardistomine genera (Figs 13A–16A) the mentum is slightly transverse to slightly elongate (L/W 0.57–0.95), a morphocline being Aspidoglossa—Semiardistomis—Ardistomis.
In the Ardistomina, the apex of the lateral lobes (ll) is extended distally beyond the apex of the mental tooth (mt). This feature is varied among the clivinines: lateral lobes not extended beyond the apex of the mental tooth (Clivina, Oxydrepanus, and Nyctosyles, Figs 17A, 18A, 21A), to slightly extended beyond that line (Schizogenius and Ancus, Figs 19A, 20A).
The paraglossae (pg) are elongate, extended distinctly beyond the apex of the glossal sclerite (gs) in most genera of Ardistomina and Clivinina. In the ardistomine Ardistomis (Fig. 15B) and clivinine Nyctosyles (Fig. 21B) the paraglossae are much shorter than the glossal sclerite.
The glossal sclerite (gs) varies appreciably in both subtribes, being very large and rotund in Semiardistomis (Figs 13B, 14B4), broad with a broad apex in Nyctosyles (Fig. 21), and narrower and shorter in the remaining ardistomines and clivinines.
The glossal sclerite in the genus Semiardistomis has an extra pair of preapical setae (Figs 13B, 14B, pas). All other ardistomine and clivinine genera have a single pair of glossal setae (as).
Labial palpomere 3 (lp3) is elongate and fusiform in the Ardistomina (Figs 13A–16A). This sclerite varies in the clivinines: fusiform in Clivina (Fig. 17A), and variously widened in the remaining clivinine exemplar genera (Figs 18A–21A).
Female genitalia: The ovipositor sclerites come in two types, either ardistomine (Figs 27–30) or clivinine (Figs 31A–36A). For clivinine genera Clivina, Nyctosyles and Obadius, the gonocoxa is segmented, each segment designated as a gonocoxite (gc1, gc2). Gonocoxite 2 is more or less falcate. In ardistomine females, in contrast, the gonocoxa (gc) is unsegmented, and slightly curved or essentially straight. The laterotergites (lt) of clivinines are more or less triangular, whereas those of ardistomines are rectanguloid. Further, the laterotergites and gonocoxites of clivinines are setose along their margins, but the apex of gonocoxite 2 is glabrous. In contrast, for ardistomines, the ovipositor sclerites are essentially glabrous, but the apex of the gonocoxa bears a few setae. An unsegmented gonocoxa with reduced number of setae is also seen in Dyschiriina (Fedorenko, 1996). Within the ardistomines, the gonocoxae of Aspidoglossa and Ardistomis are moderately broad (Figs 29, 30), but those of Semiardistomis (Figs 27, 28) are slender, virtually rod-like.
Within the Clivinina, the reproductive tract (Figs 31A–36A) is strikingly varied, but the range of variation is about as extensive as, and similar to, that of the Ardistomina, and thus uninformative from a diagnostic perspective at subtribal level. Within each subtribe, the genera are clearly distinguishable from one another. Here, I treat only the ardistomine genera.
In Aspidoglossa females (Fig. 30), the spermathecal duct (spd) is narrow, elongate, with few loose coils proximally; the spermathecal gland (spgd) is relatively short. The female tract of Ardistomis (Fig. 29) is narrow, relatively short; the spermatheca (sp) is moderately long and markedly expanded distally. For Semiardistomis females (Figs 27, 28) the reproductive tracts of the two species-groups are sufficiently different from one another to require separate descriptions. They also differ markedly from the reproductive tracts of Aspidoglossa and Ardistomis. For details, see species-group treatments, below.
The members of the Ardistomina are hygrophilous or mesophilous, living in riparian situations, lowland swamp forests, or wet montane tropical forest.
As indicated above, of the three ardistomine genera, Aspidoglossa is most similar to members of subtribe Clivinina in mandibular and mental proportions and is more remote from Ardistomis and Semiardistomis in structure of the female reproductive tract than the latter two genera are from each other. In turn, Ardistomis and Semiardistomis share elongate mandibles and mentum. Based on these observations, I conclude that relationships of these three genera may be summarized using brackets as follows: [Aspidoglossa [Ardistomis + Semiardistomis]]
This subtribe is a Western Hemisphere indigenous group. Its range extends in South America east of the Andes mountain range from central Argentina northward through Colombia, Middle America, and the West Indies to temperate North America, principally east of the Mississippi drainage basin.

Cuticular sculpture: The absence of a submarginal band of microsculpture on the proepisternum has been used to differentiate Semiardistomis from Ardistomis but the character state is not diagnostic since the band has been lost in at least two lineages of Ardistomis (Valdes, 2009).
The microsculpture on the elytral disc has a diagnostic value, the absence of microsculpture being the apotypic state.
Vestiture: Hirsuteness is a common phenomenon in this genus. In the two species groups, this apotypic character state appears, its origin independently developed. In the puncticollis group, three species have hirsute structures: Semiardistomis puncticollis from southern U.S.A. (supraorbital area of the head capsule, pronotal disc, elytral disc, profemur and abdominal sternum VII), Semiardistomis pilosellus (Kult) from southern South America (elytral disc and profemur) and Semiardistomis subglabra (van Emden) from South America (profemur). In the labialis group, two species have hirsute structures: Semiardistomis viridis from southern U.S.A. (pronotal disc and elytral disc) and Semiardistomis propinquus (Putzeys) from Mexico (elytral disc),
Elytra: In this genus, I regard the state of having the striae complete and impunctate as plesiotypic, being present in both species groups.
Hind wings: Macropterous except Semiardistomis laevistriatus brachypterous. Nichols (1988a) also reported that Semiardistomis puncticollis is brachypterous.
Legs: Protarsomeres in males so slightly dilated that this feature is useless for sex recognition.
Male genitalia: Phallic structure enhances definition of the two species groups of Semiardistomis. See details, provided in the species-group diagnoses. The differences in the phallic structures are too small to separate the species within each group, a situation also known in other clivinine genera, such as Schizogenius Putzeys (see Whitehead 1972).
The first instar of Semiardistomis was described by Bousquet (2006). It was compared with Ardistomis larva by Valdes (2007) who pointed out two notable synapotypic features: absence of the coronal suture and a segmented maxillary palpomere 4.
Based primarily on male and female genitalic features, the species of Semiardistomis are arranged in two species-groups designated as the puncticollis and labialis group, respectively.
Of the 20 known species of Semiardistomis only those occurring in U.S.A. (Semiardistomis viridis (Say) and Semiardistomis puncticollis (Dejean)) are represented by large series of specimens in collections (Nichols 1988a; Bousquet 2006). The species inhabiting Central and South America and the West Indies are represented in collections by few specimens which give only an incomplete picture of the ranges of the species.
Members of this genus are difficult to identify in part because of a shortage of useful external features, and in part because the male and female genitalia, so useful in distinguishing between species groups, are not useful within each group. Moreover, some of the characters traditionally used to separate the species have been found in large samples to vary extensively. Some samples are a mixture of combinations from extreme patterns considered as different species; being impossible to demonstrate if those populations are hybrids or simply polymorphs, while in other putative species, allopatric populations exhibit no evident differences. In the labialis group in southern South America, the species limits are especially difficult to assess probably because the group is young and composed of species with a great power of dispersal. Without direct evidence of the state of gene flow between known populations, it is almost impossible to testify in favor of the reproductive isolation of each species described or in other cases to designate subspecies. I will follow a criterion with a practical value, so maybe for some species, taxonomic determination will denote unintentionally a combination of extreme characters shared by more than one biological species.

Variation of measurements (mm) and ratios for Semiardistomis glabratus identified in collections as Semiardistomis balthasari (n= 11) are: HL = 0,67–0,78–0,86; PL 1,12–1,32–1,44; PW 1,34–1,49–1,63; EL 3,33–3,66–3,87; EW 2,08–2,36–2,56; SBL 5,15–5,76–6,11; PW/EW 0,63; PW/PL 1,13; PL/EL 0,36; EW/EL 0,65.
Kult (1950) separated Semiardistomis balthasari from Semiardistomis glabratus on the basis of two character states: differences in body size and length of elytral striae. Measurements show moderate variation in size between the populations studied (see above) but the ratios show no variations in body proportions. After studying different populations across South America, I found that the length of the elytral striae varies between populations from specimens with striae 4, 5 and 6 extended to the second dorsal puncture in interval 3 (Fig. 42) to specimens with striae 4 and 5 almost extended only to the first dorsal pore in interval 3, and stria 6 almost obliterated (Fig. 43). The pattern of variation is clinal from north to south.
Data from labels suggest that the species lives along standing water bodies and swamps.
(Fig. 57). Widespread in South America, east of the Andes mountain range, from northern Brazil, north of the Equator, to Uruguay, south of the Tropic of Capricorn.

This group is defined by the following: mentum with median carina (Fig. 14C) not extended distad, beyond anterior margin of mental tooth; mental pit organs (Fig. 14A) opened through oval orifices in basal part of mentum; male genitalia with a slender phallus (Fig. 25A) with clearly delineated basal bulb (bp) and basal sclerite (bs) of the endophallus thin and slightly sclerotized (Fig. 25B); female reproductive tract (Fig. 28; cf. Fig. 27) with spermatheca duct (spd) relatively long, wide, bent in its distal portion, spermatheca very narrow, elongate, markedly convoluted in a series of tight twists. The species–group name is based on that of Semiardistomis labialis, the type species of Semiardistomis, being this group nominotypical.
As in the puncticollis group, the mental carina shows a reduction pattern northward with this prolongation markedly reduced in Semiardistomis viridis.

Kult (1950) separated Semiardistomis emdeni from Semiardistomis deletus based on differences in body proportions. My measurements indicate that the differences noted are not significant. In fact, it is difficult in this species–group to distinguish any forms based on body proportions since measurements for all species overlap. Diagnostic combination for this species is expressed in an extreme sense, so intermediate forms are found between this point and Semiardistomis flavipes or Semiardistomis semipunctatus.

Species Semiardistomis brittoni and Semiardistomis marani measurements are a subset of that of Semiardistomis flavipes specimens studied. Variation in this species is found in the microsculpture on the elytral disc which varies from being distinct on the entire surface to being present only marginally, in the extent of the elytral striae, and the size of the punctures. Such variation is seen even within populations from the same locality.

Bates (1881) pointed the high variability of labialis populations in Central America. The polymorphic condition of characters, such as body measurements and punctuation of elytra striae, have arose different designations that includes Bates’ varieties and Semiardistomis tuspanensis (Putzeys). Body sizes show little variation between geographic regions and since for each measured sample group, distance between extremes measurements is high, this character is useless to identify forms proposed. About elytra disc punctured striae, forms varies in low grades without following any clear geographic pattern having striae punctures weekly to strongly produced and striae almost disappeared (except stria number one) to moderately impressed.
(Fig. 59). The known range of this species extends in Middle America from central Costa Rica northward to northwestern Mexico (slightly north of the Tropic of Cancer).
Most label data indicate “attracted to lights”. Tenerals were collected in November.

Variation of measurements (mm) and ratios for Semiardistomis propinquus from Mexico (n=6) are: HL = 0,60–0,62–0,63; PL 1,03–1,14–1,25; PW 1,03–1,23–1,30; EL 3,31–3,47–3,63; EW 1,88–2,01–2,13; SBL 5,04–5,23–5,44; PW/EW 0,61; PW/PL 1,08; PL/EL 0,33; EW/EL 0,58.
Despite the presence of setiferous punctures (other than the usual three in interval 3) and the proportionally larger elytra, this species is markedly similar to Semiardistomis labialis and is possibly simply a hirsute form of that species. Similar variation has been documented for other Carabidae, including Agonum decorum (Say) (Liebherr 1983).
(Fig. 59). records indicate that this species is restricted to mountains in southern Mexico.
Label data indicate that exemplars of this species have been collected during the night at margins of a small pond.
This species probably constitutes a morph of Semiardistomis labialis (Chaudoir). If this is shown to be so, the name Semiardistomis propinquus will become a junior synonym of the name Semiardistomis labialis.

Habitat of Semiardistomis viridis (Say) at Grassy Waters Preserve, West Palm Beach, Florida, USA
The distribution of the species of the puncticollis group is inadequately known because most of the species have been rarely collected (except for Semiardistomis puncticollis and Semiardistomis laevistriatus). Nonetheless, some patterns can be inferred. The plesiotypic state for some characters seems to be concentrated in the northern portion of South America, with putatively apotypic character states distributed peripherally in a radial fashion. This pattern is similar for the labialis species–group. Since both groups show a similar pattern, I postulate a possible center of origin for the genus and then radiation of descendant lineages from, Northern South America.
The northern radiant of the puncticollis species-group reached temperate southern North America through what is now Middle America (Central America + Mexico). That lineage became extinct, except for its northern descendant, Semiardistomis puncticollis. An eastern lineage colonized the West Indian Lesser Antilles, evidence being the extant Semiardistomis laevistriatus, which became a forest-inhabiting brachypterous humicole, confined now to the Island of Guadeloupe (Basse Terre). Incidentally, Guadeloupe houses other clivinines: Ardistomis atripennis Putzeys (macropterous) and Ardistomis guadeloupensis Kult (brachypterous); and two species of the genus Oxydrepanus.
Southward, the distributional record is too incomplete to infer patterns. Notably are localities with many sympatric species, evidencing high power of dispersal in this southern assemblage, being Loreto and Madre de Dios in Peru the localities with highest number of sympatric species.
The labialis species–group seems to follow a similar zoogeographic structure. Northward from the putative center of radiation (Fig. 59), Semiardistomis viridis is the most derivative form. It is broadly sympatric with Semiardistomis puncticollis, and like that species may be the oldest survivor of an interruption of the ranges of the Central American lineages. But here, contrary to puncticollis species–group, a second event arose in Semiardistomis labialis and related forms in Central America, from which source originated the stock that gave rise to the West Indian Greater Antillean Semiardistomis cyaneolimbatus. That stock may have reached the islands by overseas dispersal, or by means of a now foundered land bridge. More recently, the West Indian Bahamas was invaded by Semiardistomis viridis, no doubt by overseas dispersal.
Southward (Fig. 58) in South America, , the structurally derivative forms of the labialis species– group do not show defined patterns of speciation possibly for several reasons, including the following. First, as far as I can determine, interspecific differentiation is ruled just by some variations in the elytra surface and those variations have shown to be unstable inside localities samples checked. Second, contrary to puncticollis species–group, sympatric “species” share every grade of intermediate forms evidencing a continuous flux between populations. Probably gene flow has not been interrupted southward and we just see the result of the polymorphic condition of only one species derivate from a northern ancestor.
In both species–groups some morphological characteristics, like reduction of the prolongation of the median carina of the mentum and hirsutism, have arisen northward from center of radiation following analog ways, suggesting two different paths of evolution to those states under similar evolutionary pressures.

This revision has added an important part in understanding of the structure of subtribe Ardistomina. At this point the road is clear to complete revisions for the rest of Ardistomine genera, which are under construction and will help with new elements to a better comprehension of inter generic relationships. Some questions have to be solved inside the genus originated in part by poor representation in collections of material from many areas mainly from South America. For sure, new samples and DNA studies will contribute to solve unclear specific status. In species–group labialis we have most of problems due to polymorphic condition of most species. In Central America Semiardistomis propinquus must be evaluated using consistent genetic data to determinate whether or not it is an isolated species from Semiardistomis labialis. In South America we just will be able to corroborate denominations of species Semiardistomis pallipes, Semiardistomis flavipes, Semiardistomis deletus and Semiardistomis semipunctatus when gaps in distributional records will filled with new material mainly from Amazonian and Central Brazil and meridional half of Argentina; only them, we will have data enough to picture how different characters with taxonomic value behave in relation with geographic position.
