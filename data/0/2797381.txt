Technical Reviews


A technical review is a balanced review and analysis of the literature on a scientific or medical topic related to diabetes. The technical review provides a scientific rationale for a position statement and undergoes critical peer review before submission to the Professional Practice Committee for approval. Effective January 2010, technical reports are replaced with systematic reviews, for which a priori search and inclusion/exclusion criteria are developed and published. Listed below are recent technical reviews.
