MELANOMA (SARCOMA) OF THE EYE IN A SYPHILITIC RABBIT

 A melanotic tumor developed in a defective eye of a syphilitic rabbit following repeated genital inoculations with Treponema pallidum. The appearance of the tumor coincided with the development of a syphilitic lesion in the same eye, suggesting a relation between the occurrence of the two lesions.
