Late presentation of primary headacheassociated with sexual activity: is non-invasiveangiography worthwhile?

The place of angiographyin late presentation of headacheassociated with sexual activity hasnot been defined, unlike the situationwith acute presentations. In acohort of patients fulfilling diagnosticcriteria for primaryheadache associated with sexualactivity and presenting late (atleast three weeks after headacheonset), those undergoing non-invasiveangiography showed noabnormalities. It is suggested thatnon-invasive angiography is notroutinely indicated in late presentationsof headache associated withsexual activity.
