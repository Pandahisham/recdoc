TOXEMIA OF PREGNANCY IN THE RABBIT 

 The clinical manifestations and pathology of a disorder associated with pregnancy in the rabbit have been described. The disorder bears a close analogy to toxemia of pregnancy in man and offers an experimental approach to the problems associated with that condition. The evidence at hand indicates that the disorder is of endogenous origin and arises from a disturbance of functions concerned in reproductive processes.
