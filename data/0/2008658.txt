Kaposi's Sarcoma in Uganda: Geographic and Ethnic Distribution

Over the quinquennium 1964-68 the crude annual incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in Uganda per million of the population was 7·9 overall, 14·6 for males and 1·1 for females. Statistical analysis indicates that the disease is most prevalent in highland areas to the west and among the indigenous Bantu tribes. There was no correlation with the distribution of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower leg, and Kaposi's sarcoma was not seen in an Indian or European during the period under review.
