We report the case of a 66-year-old man presenting with a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma at the left elbow 16 years afterthe extravasation of adriamycin given for a malignant ifbrous histiocytoma of the tibia.We suggest that this sarcoma originatedin a multistep way over many years, out of the chronic inflammatory tissue that developed due to a non-specific cellulardamage at the nuclear level, interfering with normal cell replication necessary for normal healing tissue healing. As a result,the non-healed chronic inflammatory tissue transformed over several years into a preneoplastic mesenchymal tumour andlater into a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma.
