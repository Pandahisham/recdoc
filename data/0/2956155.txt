GANSER'S SYNDROME : A REPORT OF TWO UNUSUAL PRESENTATIONS

Ganser's syndrome is a rare and controversial entity in psychiatric nosology. We report two cases ofGS, one developing in a 12-year-old boy, which had their onset during an episode of mania. After recovery from Ganser's syndrome, these cases were followed-up for two and five years, respectively. Interestingly both these patients evolved into bipolar disorder with one patient showing recurrence of Ganser symptoms with each subsequent episode. The importance of following-up and relevance of affective symptoms in GS is discussed.
