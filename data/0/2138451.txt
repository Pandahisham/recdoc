STUDIES ON THE PATHOGENESIS OF FEVER 

 Small quantities of highly purified granulocytic pyrogen have been separated from contaminating proteins by disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The biologically active material thus isolated was shown to be electrophoretically homogeneous at pH 9 and pH 3.8. Earlier work on the chemical properties of the pyrogen molecule has been extended to include: (a) estimation of its molecular weight by gel filtration; (b) demonstration of free sulfhydryl groups essential for its biological activity; and (c) evidence that it is not inactivated by exhaustive extraction with ethanolether or n-heptane.
