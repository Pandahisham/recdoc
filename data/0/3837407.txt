Definition and review of the lancangjiang species group of the termitophilous genus Orthogonius Macleay, 1825 (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Orthogoniini)

Academic editor: Terry Erwin
The lancanjiang species group of the termitophilous ground beetle genus Orthogonius Macleay, 1825, is defined and reviewed. This group is characterized by the black and rather elongate body, dense punctation on head and elytra, long and slender appendages, thin fore tibiae, and elytral interval 3 without a subapical setiferous pore. To date, the lancanjiang species group is composed of four species and one subspecies, including three new species and one new subspecies which are described in the present paper: O. macrophthalmussp. n. (northern Vietnam), O. euthyphallussp. n. (southern Vietnam), O. euthyphallus bolavenensisssp. n. (southern Laos) and O. carinatussp. n. (northern Laos). A distribution map and a key to all species of this group are also provided.

Many species of the termitophilous carabid genus Orthogonius Macleay, 1825 have been discovered and recorded since the beginning of this century. This dominant genus of the tribe Orthogoniini is composed of over 200 species and majority of them are distributed in the Oriental Region (Tian and Deuve 2000, 2001, 2003a, b, c, 2004, 2005, 2006a, b, 2007a, b, 2008, 2010; Lorenz 2005; Abhitha et al. 2009; Tian et al. 2012; Tian and Kirschenhofer 2013).
In order to provide information for zoogeographical pattern and phylogeny analysis on the Oriental Orthogoniini, taxonomical treatments on the supra-specific groups of Orthogonius are desperately necessary. As a part of the series work, the lancangjiang species group is dealt with in the present paper.
Orthogonius lancangjiang Tian & Deuve, 2006 was described based on a unique male specimen, from the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. It represents a peculiar lineage in Orthogonius by having several character states, viz. elongate body and slender appendages, dense punctation on head and elytra, the subapical setiferous pore wanted on interval 3 of elytra, and the male genitalia more or less straight and blunt at apex.
All materials used for study were dry and mounted specimens. Dissections, drawings, and observations were made using a binocular Leica MZ75 dissecting microscope. Dissected genital pieces, including the median lobe and parameres of the aedeagus, were glued on small paper cards and then pinned under the specimen from which they were removed. Digital pictures were originally taken with a Canon EOS 40D camera, and then treated by means of CombineZP and Photoshop software. The geographical distribution map was made using Mapinfo Professional 8.5 SCP software.

Members of the lancangjiang species group share the following combination of character states: body black and somewhat elongate, appendages slender (Figs 2–9); head and elytra densely punctate; fore tibia thin, outer angle obtuse or disappeared; labrum broadly rounded at front; palps stout, ligula bisetose, each of mentum and submentum bisetose, palpiger asetose; antennae long and slender, extending over basal 2/5 of elytra; pronotum more or less quadrate although both front and hind angles rounded; expanded lateral margins well marked, and slightly reflexed; interval 3 with only fore and middle setiferous pores, the subapical one absent (in the original description of Orthogonius lancangjiang Tian & Deuve, 2006, the so-called three pores on interval 3 is actually including a marginal umbilicate pore located near apex of interval 3); elytra well bordered at base; intervals 4–7 normal or partly carinate; elytra broadly truncate, with outer apical angle rounded and inner angle denticulate; middle tibiae not inflate in male, but more slender than in female, and distinctly curved behind middle; prosternal process weakly bordered at apex; middle coxae smooth and glabrous, asetose in the median portion; hind tibiae with apical spurs long, thin and sharp; all tarsal claws distinctly pectinate; hind tarsomere 4 emarginate at apical margin; male genital organ exposed; median lobe of aedeagus quite long, nearly straight on ventral margin, except subapex slightly convex, apex blunt, apical lamella short, tip of apex broadly rounded.
Sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism is easily recognized in the lancangjiang species group. Although males and females are more or less similar in appearance, they are different on the following aspects: (1) fore tarsomeres 1–3 in male with two rows of spongy setae along median portion (Fig. 10), but lacking in female (Fig. 11); (2) male genitalia (at least apex of the median lobe of aedeagus) more or less exposed; (3) middle tibiae slender and strongly curved inwards in male, while stout and not curved in female; (4) in Orthogonius carinatus sp. n. (perhaps also Orthogonius macrophthalmus sp. n. in which male is still unknown), elytral intervals 4–6 normal in male, but sub-carinate at bases in female; (5) ventrite VII deeply concave in apical margin in male, while complete in female; (6) antennae slender and a little longer in male than in female; and (7) pronotum finely punctate in male, impunctate in female.
Geographical distribution of the lancangjiang species group. In total, four species and one subspecies have been recorded in this group. In addition to Orthogonius lancangjiang, three species and one subspecies are new to science and described here. The distribution area of the lancangjiang species group is limited to Laos and Vietnam according to present data (Fig. 1). It is still uncertain whether or not the Mekong River serves as a distributional boundary in west.

Figs 1, 5
Large sized, elytra broader and more ovate; head stout, as long as wide, covered with dense intricate wrinkles mixed with punctures; eyes very large and strongly prominent; labrum round at front; pronotum wide and distinctly transverse; whole lateral expanded margins distinctly reflexed; elytra carinate only on basal 1/3 of interval 7, intervals 4–6 normal; elytral apex distinctly denticulate.
Length: 16.0 mm; width: 6.5 mm. Habitus as in Fig. 5.
Head, pronotum and elytra black, antennomeres 1–4, clypeus, mandibles dark brown, palps, tarsi, and rest of antennae red brown.
Macrosculpture: Head densely wrinkled, punctures dense on frons and sparser on vertex and neck; pronotum glabrous and smooth, impunctate; elytra finely punctate on all intervals; underside smooth and glabrous.
Microsculpture: Engraved meshes densely isodiametric on elytra, somewhat transverse on head and pronotum.
Head stout, as long as wide,eyes very large, strongly prominent, frons and vertex convex, frontal impressions not well defined, wide, covered with punctures and wrinkles, not extending over level of middle eyes or anterior supraorbital pores; clypeus bisetose, base rugose; labrum sexsetose, front broadly convex; mandibles rather short, widened at base, median tooth distinct; ligula slightly dilated, bisetose at apex; maxillary palps rather stout, subcylindrical, maxillary palpomere 3 distinctly longer than 4, both glabrous, except for palpomere 3 with two setae at apex; labial palpomeres stout, palpomere 3 expanded, less twice as long as wide; palpomere 2 cylindrical, as long as palpomere 3, bisetose on inner margin, and with two or three additional setae at subapex and apex; palpiger asetose, mentum and submentum each with one pair of long setae; mentum without median tooth. Antennae long, beyond basal 1/3 of elytra; pubescent from basal 1/3 of antennomere 4, antennomere 3 as long as 4.
Pronotum strongly transverse, PW/PL=1.71, disc moderately convex; sides evenly rounded, widest at about middle, both basal and fore margins beaded, lateral expanded margins well defined and smooth, narrowest near fore angle, then gradually widened towards base, moderately reflexed throughout; fore and hind angles rounded; both fore and hind transversal impressions marked, basal foveae small; median line clear.
Elytra broadly ovate, EL/EW=1.50, moderately convex, basal border complete; sides slightly dilated at middle, hardly parallel-sided; striae deep, intervals distinctly convex, intervals subequal in width in middle; apex broadly and roundly truncate, outer angle rounded, inner angle nearly rectangular, denticulate; carinate on 2/3 of intervals 7 from base, other intervals normal; interval 3 with only the basal and middle setiferous pores, subapical pore absent.
Prosternal process faintly bordered at apex.
Legs slender; middle and hind coxae glabrous in median portion; fore tibia slightly dilated at apex, outer angle obtuse, apex slightly and obliquely truncate, outer margin not deeply sinuate, subserrate; middle and hind tibiae hardly dilated at apex; hind tibia with apical spurs long and sharp; hind femur slightly expanded medially, with two long setae posteriorly; hind tarsomeres 1 and 3 much longer than 2 and 4, respectively, length ratio of hind tarsomeres 1–4 as 4.3: 2.6: 1.6: 1.0; tarsomere 4 asymmetrically an deeply emarginate at apex, lobe about 1/3 as long as length; claws moderately pectinate.
Male. Unknown.
This new species is close to Orthogonius carinatus sp. n., but differs in having larger and strongly prominent eyes; wider and distinctly transverse pronotum (narrower and slightly transverse in Orthogonius carinatus sp. n.); short and broader elytra (slender in Orthogonius carinatus sp. n.), and only interval 7 in female carinate (bases of intervals 4–6 as well as interval 7 carinate in Orthogonius carinatus sp. n.).
Holotype: female, labeled: “I.R.Sc.N.B / Vietnam: Pia-Oac Mt., 22.36N/ 105.53E; pine forest (light trap), 03–VIII–2010; I.G.31.668, leg. J. Constant & P. Limbourg”, in IRSNB.
The name of the new species refers to its large and markedly prominent eyes.
