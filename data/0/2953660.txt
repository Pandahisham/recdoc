RECURRENCE OF PUERPERAL PSYCHOSIS IN BOTH PRE AND POST-PARTUM PERIODS: A CASE REPORT

A case of recurrent pre and postpartum psychosis is described. Pre-partum psychosis was more severe in intensity when compared with postpartum psychosis and, if untreated, it may have continued as postpartum psychosis. Presence of bipolar affective illness in the family, ongoing stressor and unplanned pregnancy may be the risk factors for developing pregnancy- related psychosis. This case report also adds weight to the proposition that puerperal psychosis might occur in late pregnancy also.
