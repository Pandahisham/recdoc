The risk of poor vaccine immunogenicity and more severe influenza disease in                        HIV necessitate strategies to improve vaccine efficacy.
A randomized, multi-centered, controlled, vaccine trial with three parallel                        groups was conducted at 12 CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network sites. Three                        dosing strategies were used in HIV infected adults (18 to 60 years): two                        standard doses over 28 days, two double doses over 28 days and a single                        standard dose of influenza vaccine, administered prior to the 2008 influenza                        season. A trivalent killed split non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine                        (Fluviral™) was used. Serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity                        for the three influenza strains in the vaccine was measured to assess                        immunogenicity.
297 of 298 participants received at least one injection. Baseline CD4 (median                        470 cells/µL) and HIV RNA (76% of patients with viral load                        <50 copies/mL) were similar between groups. 89% were on HAART. The                        overall immunogenicity of influenza vaccine across time points and the three                        influenza strains assessed was poor (Range HAI                        ≥40 = 31–58%). Double dose plus double                        dose booster slightly increased the proportion achieving HAI titre doubling                        from baseline for A/Brisbane and B/Florida at weeks 4, 8 and 20 compared to                        standard vaccine dose. Increased immunogenicity with increased antigen dose                        and booster dosing was most apparent in participants with unsuppressed HIV                        RNA at baseline. None of 8 serious adverse events were thought to be                        immunization-related.
Even with increased antigen dose and booster dosing, non-adjuvanted influenza                        vaccine immunogenicity is poor in HIV infected individuals. Alternative                        influenza vaccines are required in this hyporesponsive population.

HIV infection is associated with deficiencies in both humoral and cell-mediated                immunity, which can alter the course of common infections and influence vaccine                    immunogenicity.[1],[2], [3], [4], [5] While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)                partially restores these deficiencies, HIV-infected persons remain at increased risk                for morbidity from infectious diseases, especially if the ability to generate                antigen-specific responses remains impaired.[6]
HIV infection predisposes individuals to increased susceptibility to influenza,                prolonged viral replication and shedding, longer duration of influenza symptoms and                higher influenza-related mortality.[3], [7], [8], [9] The risk for influenza-related death is estimated to be                9.4–14.6 per 10,000 in persons with AIDS, compared with 0.09–0.10 per                10,000 among healthy adults aged 25 to 54 years and 6.4–7.0 per 10,000 among                the elderly.[10] In                another study, the risk for cardiopulmonary hospitalizations among women with HIV                infection was higher during influenza seasons.[11]
Controlled trials of single dose inactivated influenza vaccine in HIV-infected adults                conducted both in the pre- and post-HAART eras have demonstrated safety but                suboptimal antibody response.[2], [3][12], [13] The likelihood of achieving seroprotective antibodies is                particularly poor in those with advanced HIV disease.[7], [14], [15] Vaccine immunogenicity is                better in HIV seropositive persons with minimal or no AIDS-related symptoms and high                CD4 counts.[14],                    [15], [16], [17],[18] However, even                in antiretroviral treated HIV patients with high influenza vaccination rates,                protection from influenza disease is deficient.[19] Although the use of booster                dosing and increased vaccine antigen dose have been assessed in the past, the                results are conflicting, based on pre-HAART populations and limited by small sample                    size.[14],                    [20]
Definitive studies of alternative influenza vaccination strategies in this population                are required. To this end, we evaluated the efficacy of increased vaccine antigen                dose and the administration of a vaccine booster dose in a representative HIV study                population.
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as                supporting information; see Checklist S1, Flowchart S1, and Protocol S1.
A randomized, multi-centered, controlled, vaccine study with three parallel                    groups was conducted. HIV-infected volunteers, in otherwise stable health, aged                    18 to 60 years, were recruited at twelve Canadian Institutes of Health Research                    Canadian HIV Clinical Trials Network sites located across Canada (see                    Acknowledgements for list of contributing sites). Enrolment began following                    research ethics approval obtained at each individual site. Informed, written                    consent was obtained from each participant. Exclusion criteria included: receipt                    or anticipated requirement of blood products, vaccine, or immunoglobulin                    preparation within one month of study vaccine administration until completion of                    study, use of immunosuppressive therapy or immune modulators, dialysis,                    autoimmune disease, alcohol consumption ≥4 drinks per day, history of cancer                    with the exception of cutaneous cancers including Kaposi Sarcoma, basal cell                    carcinoma and non-invasive HPV-related malignancy, known or suspected                    hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines, including chicken eggs                    or egg products and Thimerosol, history of immediate hypersensitivity reaction                    and/or reaction resulting in neurological symptoms to a previous dose of any                    influenza vaccine, or presentation with or any recent history (within 24 hours)                    of any febrile illness (>38°C) or symptoms of significant local or                    systemic infection. There were no exclusion criteria for antiretroviral use, HIV                    viral load or CD4 T lymphocyte count.
The vaccine used was the 2008 seasonal trivalent killed split non-adjuvanted                    influenza vaccine (Fluviral™, GSK, Laval, Canada) containing                    A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006.                    Subjects recruited at each site were centrally randomized by the Canadian HIV                    Trials Network to one of three groups. Participants and all study staff were                    blinded to allocation, except for the individual who prepared the vaccine who                    had no direct contact with study participants. Group 1 received one adult dose                    of influenza vaccine (0.5 mL or 15 µg HA) between October 1st and November                    15th 2008, followed by a booster influenza vaccine administered 28 days later.                    Group 2 received one double dose of influenza vaccine (1.0 mL or 30 µg HA)                    during the same interval, followed by a booster double dose of vaccine                    administered 28 days later. Group 3 received a single adult dose (0.5 mL or 15                    µg HA) of influenza vaccine. Placebo injections were not utilized in this                    study. Randomization was stratified by CD4 T lymphocyte count (<200                    cells/µL versus ≥200 cells/µL).
Blood samples were centrifuged and the sera from each were aliquoted into vials                    (minimum 2.0 ml/vial) for frozen storage at −80°C. Once all study                    specimens were collected, three sets of aliquots of each serum sample were                    transported frozen to the laboratory (GB) for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)                    titre evaluation. HAI titres were measured according to WHO standard                        protocol.[21]                    Briefly, non-specific inhibitors were removed from serum by overnight treatment                    with receptor destroying enzyme (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan). Physiologic saline                    solution was then added to achieve a 1∶10 dilution, followed by incubation                    with packed guinea pig red blood cells (GRBC) (Lampire Biological Laboratories                    Inc., Pipersville, PA) at 4°C for 60 min to remove non-specific agglutinins.                    Treated serum was serially diluted in 25 µl of PBS and then mixed with an                    equal volume of PBS containing 4 hemagglutinin units of A/Brisbane/59/2007                    (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) or B/Florida/4/2006 viruses. After 30 min of                    incubation at room temperature, 50 µl of 1% GRBC solution was added                    to the mixture and incubated for 45–60 min before evaluation of                    hemagglutination. The HAI titer was recorded as the reciprocal of the last                    dilution that inhibited hemagglutination.
All subjects developing febrile respiratory syndromes during the 20-week period                    following initial influenza vaccination were asked to report to clinic for                    assessment. A respiratory illness symptom diary was also provided to capture                    events. Respiratory infections were defined as a temperature >38.0°C                    associated with any one or more of the following clinical symptoms:                    feverishness/chills; cough; tachypnea/dyspnea; wheezing/stridor; rhinorrhea;                    sore throat; myalgias. An in-house real-time multiplex reverse-transcriptase PCR                    assay was utilized to identify influenza in those who presented while                        symptomatic.[22]
All subjects were observed at the site clinic for 15 minutes following each study                    vaccination to monitor for anaphylactic reactions, as well as for any other                    local and/or systemic reactions, to the vaccine. Subjects were then provided                    with, and instructed how to use, a thermometer, a transparent ruler and a diary                    to continue to monitor for any local and/or systemic reactions to the vaccine                    for 7 days following the study vaccination. Subjects were asked to record their                    temperature (°C), any redness or swelling at or near the injection site                    (mm), the severity of symptoms: pain (at or near the injection site), malaise,                    headache, fatigue (none, mild, moderate, severe), and any other adverse events.                    They were also asked to contact the clinic if they were experiencing a fever. A                    new diary was provided at each study visit to record any events that occurred                    during the time before the next visit.
The primary objective was to compare the immunogenicity of each of the two novel                    vaccination strategies with the traditional strategy of a single standard dose                    for each of the three influenza strains. The proportion of subjects achieving                    doubling of HAI titre from baseline at week 8 was selected as the primary                    outcome given the anticipated potential for diminished immunogenicity in this                    vaccine hyporesponsive population. Sample size calculations for this study were                    based on the comparison of two independent proportions using a two-tailed α                    of 0.05 and a (1-β) of 0.90. The control rate of doubling of titres was                    estimated to be 50%, and it was hypothesized that the modified doses of                    vaccine would improve the proportion of those doubling titre levels to                    75%, an improvement of 25%.
As recommended by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) [23], the                    proportion achieving seroconversion (quadrupling of HAI titre from baseline) and                    seroprotection (HAI titre ≥40 and ≥80 in those with baseline HAI titres                    ≤10) were assessed and compared by randomized group at weeks 4, 8, and 20.                    These benchmarks are associated with high level protection from clinical illness                    resulting from influenza infection. Seroconversion proportions over 40%                    and seroprotection titres ≥40 in 70% of recipients are standard                    targets required for approval of seasonal influenza vaccines. Geometric mean                    titres (GMT) at these time points and geometric mean ratios (GMR) with baseline                    were calculated and compared between groups. As per protocol, two pair wise                    comparisons were conducted for each outcome: 1) single dose plus booster versus                    single dose only, and 2) double dose plus booster versus single dose only.                    Proportions were compared using chi-square tests and GMT by t-tests. Missing                    values were imputed for week 8 outcomes only as follows: if an outcome, e.g.                    doubling of titres from baseline, was positive at weeks 4 and 20, it was                    considered to be positive at week 8 as well. Otherwise, missing responses were                    considered to be negative outcomes.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the effects of key                    potential predictors of immunogenicity outcomes. For each outcome, all variables                    with p-values <0.15 in individual models controlling for treatment group were                    entered into multivariable regression models.
Secondary outcomes included self-reported influenza-like illness and                    PCR-confirmed influenza A and B identified from nasopharyngeal swab. The                    original plan was to compare proportions between groups as for the titre                    outcomes, but since the number of events was unexpectedly small, simple                    descriptions were used instead. All analyses were done using SAS (Statistical                    Analysis Software), Version 9.1.3.
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups (Table 1). The mean age was                    47 (SD 8.5) years. The majority were male and on HAART with HIV RNA levels below                    detection (<50 copies/mL). The baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte count was 470                    cells/µL. Despite a high proportion having been vaccinated the previous                    year (84%), most participants (A/Brisbane: 67%, A/Uruguay:                    72%, B/Florida: 56%) had HAI titres ≤ 10 at baseline.
Two hundred and ninety-eight participants were randomized, 297 received the first                    vaccination at baseline, and 281 returned for the follow-up visit 28 days                    (+/− 8 days) later. HAI titre measurements were unavailable for                    6% of patients at week 4 and 9% at weeks 8 and 20. The                    distribution of missing values was balanced across treatment groups. For those                    missing week 8 titre values, a positive primary outcome was imputed for 4 of 25                    patients missing A/Brisbane strain data, 2 of 16 patients missing A/Uruguay                    strain results, and 6 of 29 patients without B/Florida strain titres.
Overall vaccine immunogenicity was poor, even by less stringent doubling of                        titre criteria (Figure                        1, panel A, B, C). CPMP seroconversion criteria (i.e. quadrupling of                        titres in >40% of recipients) was met only in double dose and                        double dose booster recipients for A/Uruguay (Figure 2, panel A, B). Seroprotection                        (i.e. HAI titres ≥40 in >70% of recipients) was not achieved                        with any of the three strategies evaluated (Figure 3, panel A, B). GMT criteria (i.e.                        ≥2.5-fold increase in GMT from baseline) was only met for A/Uruguay at                        week 8 (standard dose plus booster: 2.6, double dose plus booster: 2.9,                        standard dose: 2.4).
The proportion of vaccine recipients with doubling of HAI titres are                                described at week 4 (i.e. 4 weeks following the initial                                vaccination), week 8 (i.e. 8 weeks following the initial vaccination                                and 4 weeks following the booster dose in groups 1 and 2), and week                                20. The HAI titre response is described for each of the three                                antigens included in the administered vaccine (A/H3N2/Uruguay,                                A/H1N1/Brisbane, B/Florida). Group 1 (single dose followed by single                                dose booster at week 4), Group 2 (double dose followed by double                                dose booster at week 4) and Group 3 (single dose without booster at                                week 4) are depicted.
The proportion of vaccine recipients with a quadrupling of HAI titres                                are described at week 4 (i.e. 4 weeks following the initial                                vaccination), week 8 (i.e. 8 weeks following the initial vaccination                                and 4 weeks following the booster dose in groups 1 and 2), and week                                20. The HAI titre response is described for each of the three                                antigens included in the administered vaccine (A/H3N2/Uruguay,                                A/H1N1/Brisbane, B/Florida). Group 1 (single dose followed by single                                dose booster at week 4), Group 2 (double dose followed by double                                dose booster at week 4) and Group 3 (single dose without booster at                                week 4) are depicted.
The proportion of vaccine recipients with baseline HAI titres ≤10                                achieving seroprotection (titres ≥40) are described at week 4                                (i.e. 4 weeks following the initial vaccination), week 8 (i.e. 8                                weeks following the initial vaccination and 4 weeks following the                                booster dose in groups 1 and 2), and week 20. The HAI titre response                                is described for each of the three antigens included in the                                administered vaccine (A/H3N2/Uruguay, A/H1N1/Brisbane, B/Florida).                                Group 1 (single dose followed by single dose booster at week 4),                                Group 2 (double dose followed by double dose booster at week 4) and                                Group 3 (single dose without booster at week 4) are depicted.
The effect of booster dosing was evaluated at weeks 8 (4 weeks post booster)                        and 20 (16 weeks post booster). The overall HAI titres achieved were                        disappointing. However, some evidence of benefit with booster dosing was                        detected. The administration of a double dose plus double dose booster                        increased the proportion of those achieving a doubling of HAI titres from                        baseline at week 8 for A/Brisbane (61% vs 44%,                        p = 0.02) and B/Florida (50% vs 35%,                        p = 0.03) (Figure 1, panel B) and at week 20 (47% vs 31%,                        p = 0.02) for A/Brisbane (Figure 1, panel C) compared to recipients                        of a single standard vaccine dose. Administration of a standard dose plus                        booster dose increased the proportion of those achieving a doubling in HAI                        titres from baseline for B/Florida at week 8 (50% vs 35%,                        p = 0.04) (Figure 1, panel B) and week 20 (38% vs 23%,                        p = 0.03) (Figure 1, panel C) compared to recipients of a standard dose of                        vaccine. The direction of effect for A/Brisbane was similar but not                        statistically significant at weeks 8 and 20 (Figure 1, panels B, C). Booster dosing                        did not improve HAI titre doubling for A/Uruguay.
Administration of a double dose plus double dose booster increased the                        proportion of those achieving seroconversion (4-fold increase in HAI from                        baseline) for A/Brisbane at weeks 8 (37% vs 20%,                        p = 0.01) (Figure 2, panel B) and 20 (26% vs 15%,                        p = 0.05) (Figure 2, panel C) compared to recipients of a standard vaccine                        dose. Similar trends were noted for the other two antigens. A standard dose                        booster did not increase the proportion of those achieving seroconversion at                        weeks 8 or 20 compared to a single standard dose of vaccine without booster                            (Figure 2, panels B,                        C).
Seroprotection was assessed in those with baseline HAI titres ≤10 (Figure 3). Although still                        low overall, the double dose plus booster strategy consistently demonstrated                        trends toward improved seroprotection at weeks 8 (Figure 3, panel B) and 20 (Figure 3, panel C) for all                        three antigens compared to a single standard dose. This was also observed                        for high seroprotective HAI titres (≥80) at week 8 for A/Uruguay                        (27% vs 11%, p = 0.02). A standard dose                        followed by a standard dose booster did not consistently improve these                        endpoint measures.
GMT and GMR were compared at weeks 8 and 20 to evaluate the effect of booster                        dosing (data not shown). Although the direction of effect consistently                        favored booster versus non-booster dosing strategies for the A/Brisbane and                        A/Uruguay strains, this was not statistically or clinically significant. The                        same was true for double dose versus standard dose booster recipients. GMT                        and GMR declined significantly irrespective of dosing strategy by week                        20.
Given the study design, the effect of an increased dose of vaccine (30                        µg of each antigen) could be assessed and compared to standard dose                        (15 µg of each antigen) at week 4. Although not statistically                        significant, a trend toward increased HAI titre doubling was noted with                        A/Brisbane and B/Florida (Figure 1, panels A, B, C). Seroconversion rates for A/Brisbane                        at week 4 (Figure 2,                        panel A) were increased significantly and similar trends were noted for the                        other antigens. Week 4 seroprotection (HAI titre ≥40) was assessed in                        those with baseline HAI titres ≤10 (Figure 3, panel A). A trend favoring                        increased antigen dose was noted for A/Brisbane and B/Florida but not                        A/Uruguay (Figure 3,                        panel A). GMT titres were higher, although not statistically significant, at                        week 4 in double dose recipients (A/Brisbane: 32.9; A/Uruguay: 47.3;                        B/Florida: 32.0) compared to single (combined data from Groups 1 and 3 for                        A/Brisbane: 26.5; A/Uruguay: 38.8; B/Florida: 29.9)                        (p = 0.12, 0.22, 0.61, respectively).
As planned a priori, the possible differential treatment                        effect for patients without HIV viral suppression was explored by means of a                        sub-group analysis, examining the differences in HAI titre doubling for the                        72 patients with non-suppressed HIV viral load in comparison to the 226 with                        viral load suppression (Figure                            4). Among HIV RNA non-suppressed patients, double dose vaccine                        appeared to improve HAI titre doubling at week 4 and booster dosing improved                        this measure at weeks 8 and 20 for each antigen, although the differences                        were not statistically significant. Similar trends were noted for                        seroprotection and seroconversion (data not shown). This trend was not                        apparent in those with HIV RNA suppression.
The proportion of vaccine recipients achieving HAI doubling at week                                4, 8 and 20 is described as a function of whether HIV RNA was below                                the lower limit of detection at baseline (<50 copies/mL)                                (n = 226) or above this level                                (n = 72). Each of the three antigens included                                in the administered vaccine (A/H3N2/Uruguay, A/H1N1/Brisbane,                                B/Florida) is considered. Group 1 (single dose followed by single                                dose booster at week 4), Group 2 (double dose followed by double                                dose booster at week 4) and Group 3 (single dose without booster at                                week 4) are depicted.
Exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate for factors predictive of                        vaccine immunogenicity. Multivariable logistical regression was controlled                        for baseline variables related to HIV therapy, HIV viral load, CD4 count,                        age, sex, weight, tobacco use, viral hepatitis co-infection, history of                        prior influenza vaccination, and lack of baseline influenza seroprotection                        (HAI titres ≤10). Note that adjustment for important prognostic factors                        had a minimal effect on estimates of treatment magnitude. At week 8, double                        dose plus booster recipients (in comparison with single standard dose                        recipients) were more likely to achieve HAI doubling for A/Brisbane                        [OR = 2.4 (1.3–4.4), p<0.01] and                        B/Florida [1.9 (1.0–3.5), p = 0.04] and                        seroconversion for A/Brisbane [2.2 (1.1–4.3),                        p = 0.03] as well as week 20 seroconversion for                        A/Uruguay [2.2 (1.1–4.7), p = 0.03] and                        A/Brisbane [2.1 (1.0–4.4), p = 0.05].                        Baseline HAI titre >1∶10 was highly predictive of seroprotection                        (both HAI titres ≥40 and ≥80) at weeks 8 and 20 (all antigens),                        doubling of titres at week 8 (all antigens), and doubling of titres at week                        20 (A/Uruguay and B/Florida).
Although several other isolated trends were noted with individual antigens or                        at specific time points, no other consistent immunogenicity predictors were                        identified. CD4 count was not found to predict immunogenicity when                        controlled for by baseline HIV RNA level and the other above-mentioned                        variables.
Only 28 subjects reported flu-like symptoms during the period of evaluation;                    these were evenly distributed across the three groups. Six PCR-confirmed cases                    of influenza were documented (A/Brisbane = 2; A/not                    subtyped = 2, B/not subtyped = 2). All                    recovered without complication.
Vaccinations were well tolerated without increased local reactogenicity as a                    consequence of increased antigen dose or booster dosing. None of the 8 serious                    adverse events reported were immunization-related. No HIV-related serious                    adverse events or HIV-related opportunistic infections were reported.
This randomized clinical trial evaluated two potential means of achieving improved                immunogenicity in HIV seropositive individuals: the administration a booster vaccine                dose and the use of increased antigen dose.[20] Current Centers for Disease                Control and Prevention guidelines do not recommend either practice.[24] However, the                studies on which these recommendations are based were conducted in the pre-HAART                era, evaluated small sample sizes, were not randomized and did not assess clinical                    outcomes.[18],                    [25], [26] We evaluated HIV                patients representative of most clinical settings in the developed world.                Unfortunately, no clear, uniform and clinically significant benefit was identified                with either immunization strategy.
The use of a booster dose in our analysis, either with standard dose or double dose,                slightly improved immunogenicity with two of the three antigens evaluated compared                to a single, standard dose of vaccine. This was most clearly evident in those                without HIV RNA suppression at baseline (Figure 4). However, immunogenicity was                suboptimal, irrespective of dosing strategy. Our work suggests that booster dosing                with conventional influenza vaccine will not address the issue of poor                immunogenicity in this vaccine hyporesponsive population. Although compelling, we do                not believe that our results are robust enough to recommend booster dosing in those                without HIV RNA suppression.
There is little literature evaluating the efficacy of increased influenza vaccine                antigen dose in HIV infected patients. In a sentinel work, Kroon et                    al evaluated the effect of double dose immunization in a cohort of HIV                infected patients and concluded that this strategy was ineffective in augmenting                antibody response.[14] However, the comparison arm was not randomized, the                sample size was small, and the study was conducted in the pre-HAART period. As such,                the majority of participants were profoundly immune compromised. Therefore, the                results may not be applicable to current HIV populations in the developed world. The                majority of our study population was on antiretroviral therapy with virological                suppression and CD4 counts well over 200 cells/µL. Despite a small increase in                immunogenicity with administration of a double dose, our analysis is consistent with                the findings of Kroon et al. Although higher antigen doses could be                assessed, widespread use of an increased antigen dose would create vaccine supply                issues. Therefore, the feasibility of this strategy is questionable, even if                demonstrated to be effective.
Overall, the rates of HAI protection achieved by these strategies, assessed by                various CPMP benchmarks of success [23], were disappointingly low in proportion and relatively                short-lived. Even with a lower benchmark of immunogenicity (i.e. two fold increase                in HAI titres), clear benefit was not detected. This speaks to the overall poor                immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in those with HIV infection. Our work suggests                that although increased antigen dosing may slightly increase immunogenicity four                weeks after immunization when utilizing conventional vaccines, this increase is                minimal. This finding is consistent with a recently published pandemic HIN1 study of                adult immune competent individuals in which the use of increased vaccine dose did                not improve measures of vaccine efficacy.[27] Other strategies, including                the use of vaccine adjuvants, should be evaluated in an effort to achieve more                substantive and long-lived success without the need for increased antigen dose.[28], [29]
Several limitations are acknowledged. The small sample size likely influenced our                ability to fully evaluate the influence of several key variables on the primary                outcome measure. However, this was the largest randomized controlled trial of                influenza vaccine immunogenicity in HIV patients ever conducted. Because of the                relatively low incidence of influenza in Canada during the 2008–2009 season,                insufficient cases were detected to allow for evaluation of the influences of                booster dosing or increased vaccine dose on burden of influenza infection. We did                not collect data on HIV RNA levels or CD4 T lymphocyte counts during the course of                the study. However, it was our judgment that the safety of trivalent split                non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine in the HIV population was already                    well-established.[2], [3], [12], [13] CPMP criteria for immunogenicity have not been validated                in those living with HIV. However, it seemed reasonable to consider these well                accepted criteria for evaluating immunogenicity in addition to the utilization of a                lower HAI criteria (i.e. doubling of HAI titres).
Our work has demonstrated the safety of two alternate influenza vaccine strategies in                a HIV population including increased antigen dose and the use of booster dosing.                Although this study demonstrated a slight benefit with increased antigen dose                followed by booster dosing in achieving and maintaining seroprotective HAI titres in                this immune compromised population, the gain was minimal, inconsistent, and the                overall immunogenicity was poor. Other vaccine strategies, including the use of                adjuvants, are currently under evaluation.
