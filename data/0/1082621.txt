Illness and amputation in the eighteenth century: the case of Sir James Lowther (1673-1755)

Sir james Lowther of Whitehaven (1673-1755) suffered from gout, and eventually had his right leg amputated in 1750. He also experienced other serious illnesses. Surviving correspondence between Lowther, in London, and his Whitehaven steward, contain graphic accounts of his health, particularly the serious illness and amputation of 1750. From these letters, and a document surviving in the British Museum describing an attack of erysipelis in 1742, a short, documentary account of Lowther's medical history has been compiled. If for no other reason, he deserves to be remembered for surviving an amputation without anaesthetic, at the age of seventy-seven.
