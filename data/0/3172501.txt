ATTEMPTED SUICIDES IN MADRAS

This study pertains to eighty six suicide attempters. The findings indicated that in both sexes the peak age group was 15 - 20 years, followed by 21 - 25 years. Organophosphorous compounds were found to have been used by a large number of attempters. 23.25% of our sample had contemplated on this act even prior to this episode. Alcohol was found to be an important factor behind 10.46% of cases. The scores on Eysenck Personality Questionnaire indicated that extraversion was predominantly found in our cases of attempted suicides whereas most of them scored very low on P scale.
