Carotenoderma


A young juice vendor presented with yellowish discoloration of his palms and soles of acute onset. He did not have any other finding suggestive of systemic cause for this peculiar type of discoloration [Figure 1]. He regularly drank about 5 glasses of juice, mostly carrot juice per day.
The picture shows the patient's palms and soles and the normal left palm at the centre is that of the author to compare the difference in colour
Carotenoderma: b-Carotene is the natural provitamin of vitamin A (retinol). A high intake of food containing carotene, especially carrots, causes ′carotenemia′ (increased carotene in plasma) and may induce ‘carotenoderma’ due to excess carotenes in the sweat. The condition is characterized by orange discoloration of the stratum corneum, especially on palms, soles and in areas where sebaceous glands predominate. The condition is harmless and subsides gradually when the dietary habits are regulated. It may occur in pregnancy as a ‘pica’.[1]
