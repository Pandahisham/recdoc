LITHIUM NEUROTOXICITY AT ‘THERAPEUTIC’ LEVELS A CASE REPORT

A case of a young manic patient who developed severe neurotoxicity when on lithium alone has been presented. Investigations did not reveal presence of any infection, electrolyte imbalance or rise in lithium level.
The possibility of lithium producing neurotoxicity at therapeutic levels for as yet unknown reasons is pointed out. It is suggested that this element of risk be considered when starting lithium for therapy or prophylaxis of affective disorders.
