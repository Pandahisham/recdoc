I agree with the comments that Dr Holub has made. The LAVM technique is an addition to our armamentarium to aide in the laparoscopic treatment of fibroids. As noted in the article, we evaluate the culde-sac and identify those patients with adequate culde-sacs that allow us to deliver the uterus into the vagina.
Secondly, we have not had any difficulty in removing myomas that are on the anterior surface of the uterus, and indeed, in 1 patient we removed the myomas that were identified laparoscopically. This technique is especially indicated when multiple small submucosal myomas are present.
In addition, we attempt to map myomas using a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that gives us excellent insight into the exact number and location of the myomas, and in our experience, is far better than the usual abdominal and intravaginal ultrasound.
As far as the interpretation of postsurgery urinary retention, I believe that it is a reflex spasm secondary to the retroversion of the uterus. In all cases this urine retention was self-correcting. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in all patients.
In summary, I believe that the laparoscopic assisted vaginal myomectomy is a technique that is appropriate for women who have a number of uterine myomas, especially deep intramural myomas with at least 1 large sentinel myoma. The sentinel myoma is removed laparoscopically; the culpotomy is then performed; the uterus is delivered into the vaginal area through culpotomy and the remainder of the myomas are removed.
Utilizing this technique, a precise 2 and 3 layer suturing can be carried out.
Thank you for your kind comments and your insightful evaluation.
Sincerely,
