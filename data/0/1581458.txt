Background. The incidence of unilateral twin ectopicpregnancy is a rare condition. Several factors increase the riskof ectopic pregnancy, the most important of which is pelvicinflammatory disease, followed by operative trauma, congenitalanomalies, tumors, and adhesions resulting in anatomicallydistorted fallopian tubes. We present a case of a woman with ahistory of four confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs)including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,herpes simplex virus 2, and Treponema pallidum. The caseillustrates the potential impact of sexually transmittedinfections (STIs) on the risk of a twin ectopic pregnancy.Case. A 24-year-old primigravida, presented with anunknown last menstrual period, lower abdominal pain, wateryvaginal discharge, and vaginal spotting. During thishospitalization, serum β-HCG testing was 263 mIU/mL andtransvaginal ultrasonographic examination suggested a nonviableunilateral twin ectopic pregnancy. At exploratory laparotomy, a10 cm mass involving the right fallopian tube and ovary wasexcised. Pathological evaluation of the specimen identified amonochorionic, diamnionic twin ectopic pregnancywithin the fallopian tube. Conclusions Patients with ahistory of multiple (STIs) are known to be at risk for thedevelopment of chronic pelvic infection and postinflammatoryscarring. The resulting distortion of the normal tubal anatomyleads to an increased risk of an uncommon presentation of ectopicpregnancy.

Patients with a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are at increased risk for the development ofectopic pregnancies because of postinflammatory fallopian tubescarring and deformity. Unilateral twin ectopic pregnancy is arare condition, first described in 1891 by De Ott [1]. Livetwin ectopic pregnancies are thought to occur at a frequency of1/125 000 [2]. Unilateral twin ectopic gestation is thoughtto occur in approximately 1 in 200 ectopic gestations [3].One would therefore calculate a frequency of 1 in 20 000 pregnancies with a 1% ectopic rate in the United States.Simultaneous bilateral tubal pregnancy is the rarest form ofdouble-ovum twin pregnancy.
A 24-year-old primigravida with an unknown last menstrualperiod presented to the emergency room with a 3-monthhistory of lower abdominal and lower back pain that radiatedinto her right thigh. The pain occurred two to threetimes daily, lasting 5 minutes with each episode and worseningduring the few days prior to presentation. During thethree previous months the patient described irregular vaginal bleeding and watery vaginal discharge. She was evaluated two months previously at another hospital and was diagnosed ashaving a “cyst.” She was discharged with a narcotic prescriptionthat she noted had improved her pain, but did not relieve it.
Her medical history revealed no prior surgeries or anyhistory of assisted reproduction. Coitarche began at 14 yearsof age and she noted a minimum of 15 previous sexual partners.Hospital medical records listed positive toxicologyscreen results for illegal drugs on multiple emergency roomvisits. During the previous 6 years, culture and serology resultsdocumented four prior separate infections with Chlamydiatrachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex virus2, and Treponema pallidum, respectively. The patient reportedthat she completed treatment for all four infections. Currenttesting for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae by DNAprobe was negative for both species. Serum testing for rapidplasma reagin (RPR) was also negative. The patient did notdemonstrate any clinical sequelae of herpes simplex virusand thus testing for this STI was not performed on the currentadmission.
On physical exam, the patient was afebrile, and her vitalsigns were stable. Abdominal palpation elicited tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Pelvic examination revealed bloodin the vagina, a closed cervical os, uterine tenderness, and apalpable right adnexal mass. Rectovaginal exam concurredwith the pelvic exam and stool guaiac testing for occult bloodwas negative.
Diagnostic testing showed a quantitative serum β-HCGtiter of 263 mIU/mL, a hematocrit of 38%, and a serum progesteronelevel of 2.2 ng/mL. Additionally, ultrasonographicexamination displayed a 10 × 10 × 8 cm right adnexal masscontaining a nonviable twin pregnancy with each fetalcrown-rump length corresponding to a gestational age of 9.3weeks. A separating linear echo was seen in the mass betweenthe two fetuses (Figure 1).
An exploratory laparotomy revealed a hemoperitoneumcontaining 300 mL and a 10 cm right-sided pelvic mass incorporatingthe right fallopian tube and ovary. Small intestineand the appendix were adherent by fibrous adhesions tothe mass. The contralateral ovary and fallopian tube had numerousadhesions distorting their normal anatomy. A rightsalpingoophorectomy, an appendectomy, and an extensivelysis of adhesions were performed. The patient's postoperativecourse was uncomplicated.
Pathological evaluation of the surgical specimen showeda twin pregnancy within the fallopian tube (Figure 2). Duringmore detailed histopathologic examination, the findingof a dividing membrane established the pregnancy to bemonochorionic diamnionic, and measurement of the twinfetuses estimated their gestational age at 7 weeks.
Several factors are thought to increase the risk for ectopicpregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease is associated with thegreatest increase in risk, but other associated factors includeoperative trauma, congenital anomalies, tumors, adhesions,and advancing maternal age [4].
Arey in 1923 suggested that anything that interferes withthe passage of the ovum through the tube increases the riskof an abnormal placental implantation site [5]. Additionally,studies suggest a delay in ovum transport and in implantationalso increase the risk of monozygotic twinning [6].Minor trauma to the blastocyst during assisted reproductive technology may also lead to an increased incidence ofmonozygotic twinning [7]. Correspondingly, the majority of twin ectopic pregnancies have been monozygotic. As of 1990,95% of twin ectopic pregnancies were reported as monozygotic[8].
Despite these potential sources for ectopic twin gestation,the reported incidence is low. Goker in 2001 reported onlythe one hundred and first case of unilateral twin ectopic pregnancy,and the sixth to be diagnosed preoperatively [8]. Thecurrent case is the eighth in the literature to be diagnosedpreoperatively. One reason for the low incidence may stemfrom the fact that fetal wastage in monozygotic twins is high and malformations are common [9].
In the current case, the patient's prior STIs may have hada direct causal link to her ectopic twin gestation. Currentstudies show that C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae interfere with the function of the ciliated cells of the tubal mucosa,thereby slowing ovum transport and increasing the risk fortubal implantation. Gérard reported that 7 of 10 tubes withectopic pregnancies were found to have C trachomatis [10].In addition to these findings, it has been demonstrated withlaparoscopy that one episode of PID resulted in a 12.8% incidenceof bilateral tubal occlusion, two episodes with a 35%incidence, and three episodes with a 75% incidence of bilateraltubal occlusion.
This case illustrates one of the long-term consequences ofSTIs with respect to reproductive function. Patients with a history of multiple STIs are known to be at risk for development of chronic pelvic infection and its associated fallopiantube scarring. The tubal anatomy distortion that ensues potentiallyincreases the risk for a presentation of ectopic pregnancythat is considered uncommon.
