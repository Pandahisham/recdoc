Sodium penta­fluoro­phenyl­borate

The crystal structure of the title compound, Na[(C6F5)BH3], is composed of discrete anions and cations. The sodium cations are surrounded by four anions with three short Na⋯B [2.848 (8), 2.842 (7) and 2.868 (8) Å] and two short Na⋯F contacts [2.348 (5) and 2.392 (5) Å], forming a three-dimensional network. The anion is the first structural example of a pentafluorophenyl ring carrying a BH3 group.
