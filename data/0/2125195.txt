THE EXCRETION OF NITROGEN IN FEVER

 The rise of temperature following typhoid vaccination is accompanied by a marked increase in the output of total nitrogen, creatinin, and especially of uric acid. The reaction to tuberculin is slower, but is also accompanied by an increased output of nitrogenous substances, that is, however, less uniform and generally less pronounced. In a case of malaria there was a tendency for the rise of temperature to be accompanied by an increased output of total nitrogen and less uniformly of creatinin; on two days on which the fever was preceded by rigor the output of uric acid was increased.
