We present a case of acute appendicitis from mobile cecum presenting with left upper quadrant abdominal pain.

A 58-year-old male with history of hypertension presented with constant left upper quadrant (LUQ) pain for 3 days. He denied fevers, chills, had no anorexia or association with eating, and no changes in bowel or bladder function. He was nontoxic appearing with normal vital signs. Abdomen was soft with tenderness to palpation in LUQ with normal bowel sounds. There were no masses, guarding, or other areas of tenderness. Remainder of the examination was normal. White blood count was 10,600/mm3 with 74.9% neutrophils with otherwise normal indices. Serum chemistry, urinalysis, and liver function tests, including lipase, were all in normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 217 mg/L (reference range: 0â€“7 mg/L). A computerized tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast was obtained.
The CT demonstrated a mobilized mesocecum in the left upper quadrant with a large, inflamed thick-walled appendix consistent with acute appendicitis. He underwent a laparotomy. The colon and cecum were found in the left upper quadrant with an inflamed, enlarged appendix. No malrotation or other congenital abnormalities were seen. Histology demonstrated a gangrenous appendix. He tolerated surgery well and was discharged home two days later.
Left-sided acute appendicitis is predominantly seen with congenital anomalies, e.g., situs inversus totalis and midgut malrotation.1 The majority of these present with left lower quadrant pain.1 The patient presented had LUQ pain due to a hypermobile colon. Though not specific, an elevated CRP has been suggested as a marker of acute appendicitis.2 The elevated CRP and clinical concern led to obtaining the CT.
