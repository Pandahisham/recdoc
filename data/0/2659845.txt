We present the case of a 52-year-old female with recurrent symptomatic ascending colon diverticulitis who ultimately underwent elective laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. The following is a case report and literature review pertaining to right colonic diverticular disease.

A 52-year-old female presented to the emergency departmentcomplaining of several years of right-sided abdominal pain which had recentlybecome more acute and frequent. On presentation, she described right upperquadrant pain radiating to the right middle and lower quadrants. The pain wasassociated with nausea and decreased appetite, but she did not identify anyexasperating events. She denied fevers,chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or change in bowel function. In thepreceding year, she had experienced multiple self-limited attacks of rightupper quadrant abdominal pain. Thesesymptoms prompted a workup which demonstrated cholelithiasis, and she underwentlaparoscopic cholecystectomy. Initially her pain remitted, but returned severalmonths later. Her past history was significant for gastroesophageal refluxdisease, appendectomy ten years prior, cesarean section, abdominoplasty andright oophorectomy secondary to ovarian torsion.
On exam, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Her abdominal exam was remarkable for moderate right upper, middle, and lowerquadrant tenderness to palpation without guarding or rebound tenderness. Herbowel sounds were normoactive, and no hernias were appreciated. The remainder ofher physical exam was unremarkable. Her leukocyte count was normal at 9.7 × 103/mm3,as were the remainder of her laboratory values.
A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed anddemonstrated multiple ascending colon diverticula with pericolonic strandingand colonic wall thickening (Figures 1 and 2), consistent with right colonicdiverticulitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital, placed on bowel rest,and started on intravenous antibiotic therapy. During the course of herhospitalization, her symptoms gradually resolved and she was discharged home onhospital day three. The patient was followed as an outpatient, at which timeshe elected for resection of the affected colon.
Six-weeks following her hospitalization, an uncomplicatedlaparoscopic right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse anastomosis was performed. Her postoperative course was unremarkable, and she was discharged onpostoperative day four tolerating a regular diet. Specimen pathology revealedmultiple ascending colonic diverticula. Currently, she remains asymptomaticwith no recurrence of right-sided abdominal pain.
Diverticula are mucosalherniations that protrude through openings created by the vasa recta in thecolon wall. In western countries, right-sideddiverticulosis affects approximately 5% of the population and accounts for 1.5%of patients presenting with diverticulitis. Disease prevalence is significantlyhigher in Asian countries where right-sided diverticulosis accounts for 20% ofpatients with diverticular disease and 75% of cases of diverticulitis [1]. Thisdiscrepancy is assumed secondary to dietary and genetic factors. In comparisonwith patients of left-sided diverticular disease, patients with right colonic diverticulardisease are younger at presentation, mean of 35 to 45 years of age, with equalgender distribution [2].
Right-sideddiverticula may be solitary or numerous and can be found in the appendix, cecum,or throughout the ascending colon. Whenright-sided diverticula are solitary, they are usually congenital and true diverticula;when multiple, they are typically acquired and false diverticula. For acquireddiverticula, increased intraluminal pressure and abnormal ascending colon motilityplay an important role in disease pathogenesis [3]. Patient presentation rangesfrom asymptomatic disease incidentally found on imaging study togastrointestinal bleed or inflammatory process. Approximately 3% to 15% ofpatients with colonic diverticulosis will present with a gastrointestinalbleed. Bleeding frequently occurs at the neck of the diverticulum from the vasarecti. Though the majority of diverticular GI bleeds stop spontaneously, studieshave demonstrated a significant recurrence rate quoted at 10% by 1 year and 50%by 10 years. Right-sided diverticula are responsible for greater than 50% of diverticularGI bleeds [4, 5].
When an inflammatoryprocess occurs, right-sided diverticulitis often mimics appendicitis. Significant clinical findings suggestive ofright-sided diverticulitis versus appendicitis include a low incidence of nausea,emesis, and anorexia accompanying the abdominal pain as well as variable pointof maximum tenderness to palpation on abdominal exam [6]. Other etiologies whichright-sided diverticulitis may mimic include cholecystitis, gastritis, andpeptic ulcer disease [7]. Prior to routine use of radiographic imaging, the majorityof patients were diagnosed at time of laparotomy. Several published series demonstrate thatcorrect preoperative clinical diagnosis occurs in 4% to16% of cases. Thereported incidence of finding diverticulitis during presumed appendectomy is quotedat 1 in 300 cases [6–8].
Diagnosticaccuracy is essential, as the mainstay of therapy for right-colonicdiverticulitis is medical rather than operative management. Historically,contrast enema was the procedure of choice for diagnosing right colonicdiverticula. Though accurate, this technique is limited to asymptomaticpatients secondary to risk of perforation during an acute disease flare. Currently, CT scan, ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have all been described as effective modalitiesto preoperatively differentiate right-sided diverticulitis from other intra-abdominalpathology.
CT scan in manyinstitutions has become the diagnostic modality of choice to delineate theetiology of right-sided abdominal pain. Findings on CT scan consistent with adiagnosis of right colon diverticulitis are similar to those appreciated withleft-sided disease. Findings include colonic wall thickening, presence of extraluminalmass, haziness and stranding of adjacent pericolic fat, and thickening of nearbyfascial planes [9–12]. Though CTscan has a documented diagnostic accuracy rate of 90% to 95%, right-sideddiverticulitis may still be radiographically mistaken for appendicitis withabscess, Crohn's disease, omental infarction, or colon cancer [9–11].
Anotherwidely used modality for assessing right-sided abdominal pain is US. US confers many advantages over CT scan as itdoes not use ionizing radiation, is readily available in almost every hospital,and is cost effective. The use of US in diagnosing right-sided diverticulitishas been heavily investigated. On US,the presence of rounded hypo- or anechoic structures that protrude fromthickened bowel wall, with or without strong echoes representing gas, feces orstone, is consistent with a diagnosis of right-colonic diverticulitis [13]. USfor right-sided diverticulitis, when performed by an experienced operator, has quoted 91.3% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity for correct diagnosis[9, 12–14].
ThoughCT and US both have a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing rightcolon diverticulitis, they have limitations. US is variable and operatordependent; several reports describe cases of right colonic diverticulitis beingmisdiagnosed as appendicitis with fecalith resulting in unnecessary operativeintervention [15]. CT scans utilize ionizing radiation which is a relativecontraindication in pregnancy and for young patients. For these reasons, MR hasalso been explored as a diagnostic option. A recent study from the Netherlands  demonstratedMR to accurately diagnose patients with right colonic diverticulitis [16]. Though availability and use of MR is limited in some hospitals, it may be avaluable alternative in select patients with contraindications to CT scan inwhom US is nondiagnostic.
Thetreatment of right-sided diverticula depends on severity of presentation andmodality of diagnosis. Asymptomatic diverticula incidentally found on imagingdo not require intervention. Diverticula presenting as a GI bleed are initiallymanaged conservatively with hemodynamic support as 75% of episodes areself-limited. If bleeding persists, endoscopic intervention should beattempted. In cases where endoscopic management fails, right hemicolectomy maybe necessary [4, 5]. Forpatients with recurrent GI bleed from right colon diverticula requiringmultiple transfusions or hospitalizations, the authors recommend considerationof elective right hemicolectomy.
Withthe exception of isolated cecal diverticulitis, no consensus currently existson optimal treatment of patients with right-sided colonic diverticulitis found incidentallyat time of operation. While some surgeons advocate no intervention, others recommendat minimum appendectomy or diverticulectomy if inflammation is minimal. Righthemicolectomy is reserved for extensive inflammation, perforation, or masssuspicious for carcinoma [17]. In cases of isolated cecal diverticulitis, resectionis strongly recommended [18].
If a preoperative diagnosis of uncomplicateddiverticulitis is made, patient management should consist of bowel rest and intravenousantibiotics. Right-sided diverticulitis differs from left-colon diverticulitisas it has a more indolent course. Several published series demonstrate long-term remission and control of disease solely with medical therapy. Komuta et al. published a study demonstrating99% of patients preoperatively diagnosed with uncomplicated right colondiverticulitis were successfully treated with bowel rest and antibiotics. Overan average of 3 years, 20% experienced a recurrent attack of uncomplicateddiverticulitis all of whom resolved with medical therapy. Of the 20% whorecurred, 15% experienced a third attack. Again, all patients who recurred a third time haduncomplicated presentations and were successfully treated without operativeintervention [19]. Another recently published study examined the management andoutcome of 113 patients with right colon diverticulitis over 10 years. Thispaper again demonstrated an uncomplicated recurrence rate of 20% [20]. Incontrast to recommendations for left-colon disease, age and frequency ofattacks should not prompt elective colon resection as recurrence requiringemergent intervention is rare [21]. Elective resection, however, should beconsidered in cases of frequent recurrence that interfere with activities ofdaily living as was the case in our patient.
An exception to continuedmedical therapy is isolated cecal diverticulitis. Cecal diverticulitis is anuncommon occurrence which is rarely preoperatively diagnosed. Surgical therapyranges from diverticulectomy with or without cecectomy to right hemicolectomy depending on the extent ofinflammation. Most surgeons advocate aggressive resection, as cecaldiverticulitis infrequently resolves with medical therapy and has a high rateof complicated recurrence [22, 23].
For patients presenting withcomplicated right colon diverticulitis, initial therapy is similar to patientswith left colon diverticulitis. Patients who present with abscess, but areotherwise hemodynamically stable, should be treated with percutaneous abscessdrainage, bowel rest, and intravenous antibiotics. Though uncommon, patientswith overt perforation or who are clinically unstable should be taken for immediateoperative intervention.
Right colon diverticulitis is arare entity in the West which is frequently mistaken for other diseasesprocesses, most commonly appendicitis. Radiographic imaging, with either CTscan or US, is essential for proper diagnosis as the mainstay of therapy ismedical rather than operative management. Though imaging has greatly decreasedunnecessary operative intervention; right colonic diverticulitis is still incidentallyencountered at time of operation and treatment should be tailored to the extent ofdisease process. In cases of incidental operative discovery where a normalappendix is found and colonic inflammation minimal, our recommendation is thatno intervention be undertaken. For cases of uncomplicated diverticulitisaccurately diagnosed prior to operative intervention, initial therapy shouldconsist of bowel rest with intravenous antibiotics, even in cases ofrecurrence. Elective resection should be considered based on patient preferenceor in cases where malignancy is suspected. Complicated diverticulitispresenting as abscess should be treated either by percutaneous abscess drainageor by operative intervention in cases of patient instability. Patients who presentwith hemodynamic instability or perforation should undergo emergent operativeintervention.
