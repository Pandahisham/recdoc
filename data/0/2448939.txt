Five cases of Alcaligenes pseudobacteraemia.

A cluster of five cases of pseudobacteraemia due to the organism Alcaligenes denitrificans occurred in three hospital medical wards over a four week period. The same organism was isolated from four of twelve commercially prepared bottles for erythrocyte sedimentation tests. The most likely explanation for the outbreak is that the ESR bottles were filled prior to inoculation of blood culture bottles. The outbreak was brought to an end by advising on correct procedure.
