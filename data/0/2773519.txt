Predicting the complicated neutropenic fever in the emergency                    department

The purpose of this study was to identify independent factors that can be                        used to predict whether febrile neutropenic patients who appear healthy at                        presentation will develop subsequent complications, using variables that are                        readily available in the emergency department (ED).
The medical records of 192 episodes in which the patients presented to the ED                        with neutropenic fever resulting from chemotherapy, with an alert mental                        state and haemodynamic stability were retrospectively reviewed. Endpoints                        examined were fever response to administered antibiotics, death or severe                        medical complications during hospitalisation.
Thirty-eight episodes of neutropenic fever with complicated outcomes were                        identified from among a total of 192 episodes. Three parameters emerged as                        independent factors for the prediction of neutropenic fever with                        complications in the multivariate regression analysis: platelet count                        (130−450 × 103                        cells/mm3) <50 000 cells/mm3, serum                        C-reactive protein (CRP, 0.1–1 mg/dl)                        >10 mg/dl and pulmonary infiltration on chest x                        ray.
Platelet count, CRP and pulmonary infiltration on chest x                        ray at presentation could be used to identify febrile neutropenic patients                        who will develop complications, and these factors may be useful in making                        treatment-related decisions in the ED.

Large studies have shown that neutropenic fever after chemotherapy causes death in            4–30% of patients and serious medical complications in 21%            of patients.1            2 However, it has been suggested that patients            with febrile neutropenia are a heterogenous group in terms of medical complications and            mortality. Recent advances in the treatment of neutropenic fever have highlighted the            value of risk stratification and recommended outpatient treatment for low-risk                patients.1            2            3            4            5            6
The degree and duration of neutropenia have been identified as key factors related to the            risk and outcome of infection.4 However, this            finding was of little use to the treating physician because these factors can only be            determined retrospectively.
Risk prediction models, including the Talcott model and the Multinational Association of            Supportive Care of Cancer risk index scoring system, were developed.1            3 However, the Talcott model requires information,            such as tumour response to chemotherapy, which is not readily available in the emergency            department (ED).1 It is possible that the            patient’s medical records may not be available in the ED because the patient            may be new to the institution. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care of            Cancer risk index scoring system includes variables that may be graded differently by            different physicians, such as tumour burden of illness.
Previous studies identified clinical or laboratory parameters that could serve as            independent predictive factors for risk assessment, including age, acute leukaemia and            white blood cell count.7            8            9 However, there is a slight limitation in that            these factors were not selected as predictive factors in the other studies for the            following reasons. First, the conclusions drawn from studies in children cannot be            applied to adults as a result of the differences in comorbidity and the dose of            chemotherapy administered. Second, the endpoints used in previous studies, such as            bacteraemia, serious bacterial infection or clinical complications, were various.
Studies were recently conducted to analyse the usefulness of serum inflammatory markers,            such as procalcitonin, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), in the assessment of the risk            of febrile neutropenia.10            11            12            13 However, these studies were primarily            concerned with determining whether these inflammatory markers can identify bacteraemia            rather than subsequent complications, and the value of the markers in predicting patient            outcomes is limited.10            11            12            13
Physicians will regard patients with neutropenic fever combined with shock at            presentation as being in a critical condition and treat them intensively. It is thus            important to avoid undertreating patients with complicated neutropenic fever, even            though they may have appeared healthy upon presentation at the ED.
However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to identify the objective            independent variables that can be easily assessed in the ED and use them to predict            which patients with febrile neutropenia and haemodynamic stability at presentation will            develop subsequent potentially serious complications.
Therefore, we sought to identify simple independent factors that can predict patients who            develop subsequent complications after chemotherapy-induced neutropenic fever.
The present study was a retrospective cohort study that was conducted using chart                    review methodology. This study was approved by our hospital’s                    institutional review board.
This study was conducted at a single academic tertiary care centre with an annual                    ED census of 40 000 patients with or without cancer per year. The hospital is a                    large urban medical centre and is designated as one of five specialised cancer                    centres in South Korea.
We used the hospital electronic medical record system to obtain the medical                    record numbers of the patients enrolled in this study. The patient selection                    criteria were as follows: patients presenting to the ED with C00–C97                    codes (malignant neoplasm) classified according to the International                    Classification of Diseases, version 10 between March 2004 and December 2007,                    neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm3, age older than 18 years and                    systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg at presentation. Fever was defined                    as an oral temperature greater than 38.3°C on a single occasion or                    greater than 38.0°C for one hour or longer during the first 24 h after                        admission.14 A total of 254 episodes                    was identified. However, six episodes presenting to the ED in an altered mental                    state were excluded. In addition, we excluded nine episodes who underwent                    radiotherapy before or during the febrile neutropenic episode, 27 episodes who                    were transferred to other hospitals or our hospital in the middle of treatment                    for neutropenic fever, 11 episodes who presented with neutropenic fever as an                    initial clinical manifestation of unevaluated underlying cancer, seven episodes                    with incomplete data and two episodes with AIDS.
Finally, 192 febrile neutropenic episodes occurring in 168 patients were                    analysed. Each febrile neutropenic episode was considered to be a new event.
The first author assessed whether the patient met the defined criteria for                    combined fever and chemotherapy-related neutropenia. The first assistant, who                    was unaware of the purpose of the study, classified each patient as with or                    without risk of complications during hospitalisation. Later, a second author,                    who was unaware of the risk classification and had previous experience with data                    abstraction from electronic medical records, collected the variables such as                    initial laboratory findings, empirically administered antibiotics and duration                    of hospitalisation. To test the accuracy of the risk assessment by the first                    assistant, a second assistant, who was not listed as an author, evaluated                    15% of the patient medical records selected by random sampling. There                    was no disagreement on the risk assignment.
Complicated neutropenic fever was defined when the fever did not resolve within 5                    days of starting treatment, in case of death, or in patients with serious                    medical complications that needed treatment and occurred during                hospitalisation.
The following data were collected: (1) variables that were readily available at                    presentation without information about the medical history of the patient and                    tested for their predictive value, such as age, sex, tumour type, laboratory                    variables and the interpretation of chest x ray by a                    radiologist; (2) other variables related to patients, such as latency to the                    development of neutropenic fever after recent chemotherapy, previous medical                    history, prophylactic administration of antibiotics or antifungal agents and                    presumed site of infection at presentation; (3) variables related to treatment                    and outcome, including empirically administered antibiotics, microbiological                    test results, duration of neutropenia and fever, complications, duration of                    hospitalisation and survival.
The patients were divided according to microbiologically defined infection with                    or without bacteraemia, clinically defined infection and unexplained fever                    according to previously published definitions.15
Baseline data on characteristics and outcomes were summarised by frequency                    tabulation or mean values. Univariate analysis of the association between each                    covariate and outcome was performed using the χ2 test.                    Continuous variables tested in the univariate analyses were categorised on the                    basis of clinical arguments according to physician’s judgement or                    previously published reports. All covariates with p values less than 0.05 were                    considered sufficient for the inclusion of a variable in multivariate stepwise                    logistic regression analysis, with a significance level of p<0.05.                    Estimated odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated for all                    significant variables. All reported p values are two-sided, and all statistical                    analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0.
A total of 154 episodes without complications and 38 episodes with serious                    complications was analysed. Table 1 shows the characteristics and demographic data of the 192                    episodes.
Clinical characteristics of the 192 episodes of febrile neutropenia
The mean age in the study group was 53 years. The mean blood pressure was 126.2                    mm Hg (SD 16.8) and the temperature at presentation was 37.9°C (SD                    1.0). Fifty-nine episodes had haematological malignancies, of which lymphoma (47                    episodes) was the most common underlying haematological malignancy, followed by                    11 cases of leukaemia and one case of multiple myeloma.
All patients were admitted and treated with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics as                    inpatients. A single antibiotic (meropenema, imipenem, cefepime or ceftazidime)                    was administered to 23 episodes. A total of 169 episodes (88.0%) was                    treated with the above-mentioned antibiotics in combination with an                    aminoglycoside. Eighty-three episodes with neutrophil counts less than 100                        cells/mm3 received haematopoietic growth factors during                    hospitalisation.
Nine (5.8%) of the episodes in the group of patients without                    complications and eight (21.1%) of the episodes in the group of                    patients with complications had a microbiological pathogen                    (p = 0.001). In addition, of the 60 episodes who                    had an unexplained fever, 57 were in the group of patients without complications                    (p = 0.001). However, there was no difference in                    the incidence of clinically defined infection between the groups with and                    without complications.
Neutropenia (2.6 days (SD 2.0) vs 3.8 days (SD 1.9),                    p = 0.001) lasted significantly longer in the                    group of patients with complications than in the group of patients without                    complications. Patients without complications were discharged 6.6 days (SD 4.1)                    after hospitalisation, whereas patients with complications were hospitalised for                    18.2 days (SD 16.8; p<0.001).
The most frequent complications were hypotension (34.2%), followed by                    respiratory failure (23.7%; table 2).
Serious medical complications developed in patients with complicated                            neutropenic fever
*Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure less                                than 90 mm Hg or the need for pressor to maintain blood pressure.                                †Respiratory failure was defined as arterial oxygen                                pressure less than 60 mm Hg while breathing room air or the need for                                mechanical ventilation. ‡Renal failure required treatment                                with fluids, dialysis or any other intervention.
These complications occurred within one to 9 days after admission. Other                    complications deemed clinically significant by the investigator included two                    cases of electrolyte disturbance and one case of hepatic failure. The fever did                    not resolve within 5 days after starting treatment in 14 episodes, and seven of                    them did not show any kind of serious medical complication. Seven                    (3.6%) of the patients died, and each of these patients had at least                    two serious medical complications.
Univariate analysis of the clinical parameters readily available in the ED was                    performed (table 3).
Univariate analysis of outcomes for patients with neutropenic fever
The normal ranges of complete blood counts are as follows: white                                blood cells (WBC) (4.8−10.8×103                                    cells/mm3), platelets                                    (130−450×103                                cells/mm3), 2–9% monocytes,                                50–75% neutrophils and                                20–40% lymphocytes of WBC. BUN, blood urea                                nitrogen.
In the multivariate analysis, platelets less than 50 000 cells/mm3,                    CRP greater than 10 mg/dl and pulmonary infiltration on chest x                    ray were determined to be independent factors for the prediction of neutropenic                    fever with complications that requires maximal attention from physicians (table 4).

The number of patients who appear healthy at presentation but will develop serious                complications and in whom independent variables can predict such an outcome in this                group is an important question for emergency medicine physicians. Therefore, we only                enrolled patients who were alert and had systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm                Hg at presentation. In addition, we observed the elevation of body temperature                during the first 24 h after presentation, in order to include patients who had taken                an antipyretic agent before presentation and did not have a body temperature greater                than 38.3°C at presentation.
In the present study, 19.8% of episodes experienced at least one serious                medical complication or episode of prolonged fever. Early predictive markers of                neutropenic febrile patients who are likely to develop serious complications are                thus needed to allow the rapid evaluation and treatment of febrile neutropenia, as                in 19.8% of the episodes in our study.
In our study, we excluded parameters that were affected by the subjective judgement                of the physician and those that were obtained retrospectively or through detailed                analysis of the patient’s medical history, even though these factors were                considered to be predictive factors in previous reports. Finally, platelet count,                CRP and pulmonary infiltration were shown to have a significant association with                outcome. The clear advantage of these significant variables is that there is no                observer variability and they can be very readily assessed on presentation.
The initial complete blood cell count had been investigated in several studies of                risk assessment. Studies in the field of paediatrics by Rackoff et                    al,7 Baorto et                    al16 and Klaassen et                    al17 proposed that the monocyte                count with a specific cutoff value was a significant factor in the development of                bacteraemia or severe bacterial infection. In a recent prospective study,12 none of the haematological parameters were                found to be independent variables for the prediction of complications in adults with                chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia. In our study, only platelets less than 50                000 cells/mm3 was predictive of a complicated neutropenic fever. It may                be possible that the platelet count acts as a surrogate marker of the host response                to inflammation and exposure to activated coagulation factors to accelerate                disseminated intravascular coagulopathy before the initiation of therapy.
The level of serum CRP was also recognised as an independent factor in the                multivariate model. CRP was sensitive for the prediction of neutropenic fever with                shock or complex infection in haematological malignancies.18 It is possible that the production of CRP is stimulated by                cytokines in response to infection or inflammation. However, CRP failed to predict                deterioration in adults with neutropenic fever subsequent to chemotherapy.11                12 These controversial consequences might                result from its late response to inflammation and a wide range of serum levels                related to the amount of tissue injury.
It is noteworthy that abnormality on chest x ray was significantly                associated with outcome, as in several previous studies.3                8 In particular, it was noted in                15–25% of all episodes of febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy                for haematological malignancies, and they could be responsible for the mortality                rates of up to 23–50%.19                20 In our study, pulmonary infiltration had a                higher odds ratio than other significant variables.
We suggest that the initial platelet count and serum CRP as well as pulmonary                infiltration could be used to identify patients with neutropenic fever who appear                well at admission but will develop complications. This may maximise the chance of                identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from rapid admission and                intensive treatment. We did not insist that the patients without predictive factors                should not be admitted. We cautiously suggested outpatient treatment in these cases                after observing the patient for 2–24 h to confirm the assessment of risk,                assess the patient’s medication tolerance and provide patient education,                if treatment guidelines in an individual institution are established.
This study has several limitations. First, this study was performed at a single                institution, which is one of five specialised cancer centres in our country.                Therefore, our findings may not be representative of all other institutions, and                they may vary according to the chemotherapy regimen. Second, the results of our                study are based on a retrospective analysis of a small population, and should                therefore be interpreted with some caution and confirmed through prospective                studies. However, there were no missing data regarding the laboratory findings that                were not influenced by reviewer bias and inconsistencies in patient medical records.                Third, there was no standard guideline for the administration of empirical                antimicrobial agents due to the retrospective nature of the study, and the                physician’s familiarity affected the choice of antimicrobial agent.                However, in our study, extended antimicrobial therapy was administered initially and                then modified based on microbiological findings and the patient’s                clinical response.21 Fourth, haematopoietic                growth factor was administered to 83 patients in our study. However, there was no                difference in the administration of haematopoietic growth factor between the two                groups, and the benefits of haematopoietic growth factor have not been definitively                    proved.22
