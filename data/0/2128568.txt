THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF ACRIDINE ON THE SPOROGONY OF A COCCIDIUM (EIMERIA STIEDÃ†)

 The development or ripening of the oocyst of the coccidium of the rabbit is prevented by acridine hydrochloride provided that the cysts are exposed to the action of the chemical before development has started. After sporoblasts are formed acridine does not prevent further development. Many other substances, some of them known to be active against certain protozoan parasites, have no influence on the ripening of the oocysts of the coccidium.
