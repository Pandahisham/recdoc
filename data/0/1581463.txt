Pyometra is the accumulation of purulent material in the uterinecavity. Its reported incidence is 0.01−0.5% in gynecologic patients; however, as far as elderly patients are concerned, its incidence is 13.6% [3]. The most common cause of pyometra is malignant diseases of genital tract and the consequences of their treatment (radiotherapy). Other causes are benign tumors like leiomyoma, endometrial polyps, senile cervicitis, cervicalocclusion after surgery, puerperal infections, and congenital cervical anomalies. Spontaneous rupture of the uterus is an extremely rare complication of pyometra. To our knowledge, only 21 cases of spontaneous perforation of pyometra have been reported inEnglish literature since 1980. This paper reports an additional case of spontaneous uterine rupture.

A 92-year-old woman with severe abdominal pain and vomiting for24-hour duration was admitted to our hospital. Her gynecologichistory was unremarkable having undergone an eventful menopause.She had no history of postmenopausal bleeding or increased vaginaldischarge. On the physical examination, her abdomen was verytender, distended, and showed muscle rigidity. Rebound tendernesswas absent. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. Her blood pressure was110/65 mmHg, pulse rate was 114 beats/min, and axillary temperaturewas 36.9°C. Laboratory studies demonstrated a white cellcount of 5100/mm3 with 92.3% neutrophilia and hemoglobin of 13 g/dL. A plain chest X-ray film showed free air under the diaphragm on both sides. The abdominal X-rayrevealed no evidence of intestinal obstruction. Computed tomography scan of abdomenreported the presence of fluid within the abdominal cavity.
Emergency explorative laparotomy was performed under the diagnosisof perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. The investigation ofthe gastrointestinal tract and gallbladder failed to reveal aperforation. The uterus was found to have two perforations,approximately 1 cm in diameter each, both in the uterinefundus, and purulent material exuding from the uterine cavity wasidentified. The uterus was soft and slightly enlarged. Bothparametriums were thickened and inflammatory changes were present.The fallopian tubes and the ovaries were normal. A total abdominalhysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed.Culture of the pus grew Escherichia coli andBacteroides fragilis. Histological examination revealedpyometra with no evidence of malignancy.
She was observed in the intensive care unit with strict management ofrespiration and circulation for postoperative three days. On thethird postoperative day, she was transferred to the gynecology unit.Under the antibiotherapy with cefepime and metronidazole, hercondition improved postoperatively. However, on the tenthpostoperative day, wound dehiscence occurred and secondary woundclosure was performed. No other complications have occurred, and asthe patient completely recovered, she was discharged on theeighteenth postoperative day.
Pyometra, or pyometrium, is defined as the accumulation of pus inthe uterine cavity resulting from interference with its naturaldrainage. It is an uncommon condition that occurs mainly inpostmenopausal women and is rare in the premenopausal age group[18]. The classic triad of symptoms in patients with pyometra consists of purulent vaginal discharge, postmenopausal bleeding,and lower abdominal pain [2]. Various malignant and benign diseases have been shown to cause pyometra[1–18].
Table 1 summarizes the 22 cases ofspontaneous uterine rupture since 1980, including our case. Allcases were postmenopausal elderly females, mostly in the seventhor eighth decade, except for 34- and 41-year-old women. The age atdiagnosis ranged from 34 to 92 years with a mean of 75.3 years.The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain(95.5%), vomiting (41.0%), nausea (9.1%), and fever(9.1%). The most prevalent preoperative diagnosis wasgeneralized peritonitis (47.4%), pneumoperitoneum (47.4%), and perforation of gastrointestinal tract (36.8%). In only 3 cases(15.8%), perforation of pyometra was suspected. Laparotomy wasperformed in all cases except case 12 since her general conditionwas poor [3]. Hysterectomy was performed in 18 cases. The location of perforation was in the fundus in 18 patients(85.7%). The bacteriological studies of intraperitoneal puswere positive in 17 cases, in one case it was negative, and in 4 casesit was not mentioned in the article. Mixed infection with bothanaerobes and aerobes was detected in most of the patients.Histologically, 7 cases (35%) were associated with malignantdisease, and 2 cases (10%) were associated with leiomyoma. In 10patients, no apparent cause could be identified.
Pyometra is a rare event in general population but more common inelderly women. It is caused by impairment of natural drainage ofthe cervix as a result of benign or malignant diseases. A detailedpelvic examination should be performed to rule out the associatedmalignancies. The diagnosis of pyometra is difficult, because itis usually asymptomatic.
Ruptured pyometra should be kept in mind in elderly women presenting withacute abdomen as an unusual but serious condition.
