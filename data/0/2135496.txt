PASSIVE IMMUNITY TO POLIOMYELITIS IN THE CHIMPANZEE

 A series of 6 chimpanzees was inoculated orally with stool from a poliomyelitis patient. Three of these animals had been given 170 cc. of homologous, hyperimmune monkey serum prior to inoculation, while three were unprotected. All 6 of the animals were subsequently shown to have poliomyelitis virus in their stools and characteristic lesions in their central nervous systems although none of them developed paralytic poliomyelitis. All of the immunized animals had demonstrable blood antibody at the time of inoculation although it was present in only one case 30 days later.
