Sodium p-toluenesulfinate tetra­hydrate

The title compound, Na+·C7H7O2S−·4H2O, is the hydrate of the sodium salt of para-toluene­sulfinic acid. The mol­ecular geometry around the sulfur atom is tetra­hedral with X–S–Y angles spanning a range of 102.23 (6)–110.04 (6)°. In the crystal, the water mol­ecules connect the sodium cations into chains along the b axis via O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds. An inter­molecular O—H⋯π inter­action is also observed.
