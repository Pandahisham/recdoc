Progress in establishing non-surgical oncology within English cancer units

In 1995 the Department of Health recommended a minimum standard of five non-surgical oncology sessions per week at Cancer Units. Postal surveys of cancer units in England were conducted in 1996 and 1999 to establish the level of provision. Substantial progress has been made from 20–60% of responding units meeting the minimum standard. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign
