Purpose. Examination of the potential of electroporationtherapy (EPT) in a patient with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.Patient. A 24-year-old male who underwent extensiveresection and postoperative radiotherapy for a malignantperipheral nerve sheath tumor in the right infratemporal fossawith intracranial extension and invasion of the maxillary sinusand mandible had a recurrence in the scar of his craniotomy forwhich he was initially treated with doxorubicin. Afterdiscontinuation of doxorubicin he developed a metastatic mass atthe same site for which he was treated with electroporationtherapy. Method. The subcutaneous metastasis wasinfiltrated with bleomycin and electroporated. Results.Gradually the tumor became increasingly necrotic and demarcatedfrom surrounding tissue. After 10 weeks no tumor was seen anymore.The wound healed secondarily. Discussion. Intralesionalbleomycin followed by EPT is potentially effective, welltolerated, and easy to perform in well accessible soft tissuesarcoma sites.

Sarcomas in the head and neck area are rare. The managementof soft tissue sarcomas in the head andneck is primarily surgical. However, the critical anatomy of thehead and neck limits the capacity to obtain wide surgical margins.Postoperative radiotherapy improves the local control rate[1, 2]. Despite this combination of treatment modalities, ahigher local recurrence rate and a worse disease-specific survivalof head and neck sarcoma patients are found as compared tosarcomas arising at other sites [3–5].  The results ofadjuvant chemotherapy in treatment of head and neck soft tissuesarcomas have been disappointing [6].
Electroporation therapy (EPT) is a novel local treatment modalitythat uses brief, high-intensity, pulsed electrical currents toenhance the uptake of cytotoxic drugs, vaccines, and genes intocells by producing a transient increase in cell wall permeability[7–9]. The technique is potentially useful in primary andsecondary tumors of different tumor types. EPT involves the use ofa specially developed delivery device, the MedPulser (GenetronicsBiomedical Corporation, San Diego, California, USA),which consists of a circular array of electrode needles [10].This needle array is inserted directly into the lesion(Figure 1). Experience has been achieved with varioustumor types, but there is yet no report on soft tissue sarcoma.
A 24-year-old male was referred to our institute because ofhearing loss and progressive pain complaints in his face on theright side since one month. Physical examination showed a glue earon the right side and mild trismus. No other abnormalities werefound, especially no mucosal lesions or swelling in the neck.
CT and MRI showed a large tumor in the right infratemporal fossawith intracranial extension through the foramen ovale to thecavernous sinus and growth in the posterior wall of the maxillarysinus and destruction of the ascending part of the mandible(Figure 2).
A transantral biopsy through the maxillary sinus showed onhistopathological examination a malignant peripheral nerve sheathtumor. CT-scans of the chest and abdomen and bone scintigraphy didnot show signs of distant metastases.
He underwent a resection consisting of craniotomy, parotidectomy,maxillectomy, and segmental mandibula resection with selectiveneck dissection of level I-III. The defect was reconstructed witha free vascularized iliac crest flap. His postoperative course wasuneventful. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen(Figure 3) revealed positive surgical margins. Nolymph node metastases were found in the neck dissection specimen.He received postoperative radiotherapy to a total dose of60 Gy in 30 fractions.
Unfortunately, 5 months post-operative he developed a subcutaneousmetastasis in the temporal scar of the craniotomy(Figure 4). An MRI showed that the underlying bone wasintact (Figure 5). Metastases were also present in theneck on the right-hand side. He was treated with 8 cycles ofdoxorubicin. There was a complete response of both lesions. Afterone month he developed a recurrence on the same place of his scalpagain. An MRI showed no signs of recurrence in the neck.
Since no accepted standard treatment was left, we decided topropose an experimental approach in the form of intratumoralinjection of bleomycine with electroporation therapy. Afterinformed consent was obtained, the lesion of 50 × 35 mmwas uniformly infiltrated with 60 USP-E bleomycin (4 USP-E/mL)under general anesthesia. After five minutes the tumor and a safemargin of 0.5 cm were electroporated using a six-needlearray applicator connected to the MedPulser system (Genetronics	Inc, San Diego, California), which transforms sinusoidalelectrical energy pattern [10]. Tumor and marginwere treated with 63 overlapping applicator placements(Figure 6). Gradually the tumor became increasinglynecrotic and demarcated from the surrounding tissue. The wound wascovered by hemorrhagic crusts. He had no pain complaints. After 10weeks no tumor was seen anymore. Secondary healing started fromthe margins of the wound (Figure 7). Two months afterEPT he developed a recurrence in his neck, for which he wastreated with ifosfamide. This wound healing was delayed due to hischemotherapy courses. He is presently (17 months afterelectroporation) without disease on his scalp and is doingreasonably well.
Bleomycin, a cytotoxic agent derived from actinomycetes, is apurified glycopeptide that inhibits DNA synthesis by inducingsingle-and double-stranded DNA breaks. It is hydrophilic and doesnot cross the cell membranes readily [11, 12]. EPTtemporarily increases the permeability of cell membranes bycreating transient pores. These pores permit direct diffusion ofdrugs into the cells bounded by these cell membranes, achievinghigher intracellular concentrations than can be obtained byintralesional injection alone. Not only does this permit theuptake of substances into the cytoplasm, but it also enhances theuptake in the nucleus [7]. EPT dramatically enhances theuptake of bleomycin into cells. Bleomycin has been demonstratedin vitro to exhibit the greatest increase in cytotoxicityafter EPT (a 700-fold increase) [11].  These results havebeen replicated in vivo using tumor cell lines, includingmelanoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma cell lines implantedsubcutaneously in nude mice [13–15].  These modelsdemonstrated the superiority of bleomycin in EPT over the otherdrugs tested with EPT [10,16–18].
The electric field for EPT is generated by the MedPulser system.Optimization of pore formation has been achieved using a circularsix-needle array applicator. Switching polarity of paired needleswith a second pulsing and rotating the field by 60 degrees forthree cycles results in a circle of positive and negative fieldpulses that maximize pore formation in tumor cells within thefields. Several types of probes with different sizes andshapes have been developed for application in different kinds oftumors in different parts of the body [19].
In some clinical studies it has been shown that in cutaneouslesions the response rate of bleomycin and EPT is significantlyhigher than intralesional bleomycin alone, while EPT alone showedno clinical response [16, 20].  It has been shown that EPTwith low local concentrations of bleomycin after intravenousadministration has substantially less effect than EPTfollowing intratumoral injection of bleomycin [18].
The majority of clinical papers on EPT report on successfultreatment of cutaneous malignancies, including squamous cellcarcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, and melanomas [18,21, 22].  In melanoma patients complete responserates of 72% to 89% and partial response rates of 5% to17% have been reported [16,20, 22]. The clinical use ofbleomycin and EPT to treat mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of thehead and neck has been reported [23].  EPT was also usedsuccessfully in patients with chondrosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma[22, 24].  This is the first clinical report on a successfultreatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
Although surgery with postoperative radiotherapy on indication islikely to remain the treatment of choice for primary resectablesarcomas, EPT after intralesional injection with bleomycin mayrepresent an alternative to surgical resection of recurrentdisease. In certain settings, like in our patient, EPT may beadvantageous in terms of local tissue preservation, improvedquality of life and costs. Other potential advantages areoutpatient treatment feasibility and response in settings in whichconventional therapy has failed. EPT could be particularly usefulin previously operated fields, for controlling symptomaticlocalized disease. These sites pose particular challenges in termsof wound management.
Although EPT is well tolerated by patients, activation of theMedPulser may cause unpleasant “electric shock” sensations dueto spasm of underlying muscles or due to pain relayed by localnerves that were stimulated by the MedPulser current. Our patientwas treated under general anesthesia, although sedation and localanesthesia have been used in well accessible lesions, even in anoutpatient setting [20].
In conclusion, electroporation therapy is a novel treatmentpotentially effective for sarcoma utilizing intralesionalbleomycine. It is well tolerated and easy to perform in wellaccessible sites.
