Mithramycin Treatment of Hypercalcaemia and Renal Failure in a Patient with Paratesticular Embryonic Sarcoma

A 17-year-old patient with a small paratesticular embryonic sarcoma presented with symptoms of renal failure, polyuria and widespread bone metastases. Investigation revealed hypercalcaemia and uraemia without any evidence of hyperparathyroidism. The hypercalcaemia responded over a period of weeks to administration of mithramycin with initial improvement in the symptoms and metabolic derangements. Control was lost with the necrosis of intra-abdominal tumour deposits and haemorrhagic polypoid deposits in the alimentary tract. The value and hazards of mithramycin are well demonstrated by these rare complications of this type of tumour.
