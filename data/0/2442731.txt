The concept of stress, as it applies to the human experience of feeling worn out, pressured to keep up with the frenetic pace of modern society, and “emotionally uneasy” (as one author in this book phrased it), is so pervasive in today’s culture that it would seem impossible to produce a living human adult who has avoided the experience completely. We lament about being stressed, brag about being stressed, attempt to fix and treat our stress, and (in some perverse effort to cover all our bases) stress that we are too stressed out. Yet, as it is with entities that are by their very nature primarily conceptualized as a human perceptual experience (i.e., “I feel stressed”), a neat and tidy definition of stress, particularly one that explains its underlying pathophysiology, has been elusive.
Now more than ever, as physicians and health care workers in every area of medicine are confronted with patients experiencing “stress” that affects, if not their actual bodily health, then at the very least their sense of well-being, it is imperative that we begin to understand this entity in a more coherent manner. This is the goal of a new multi-disciplinary compilation on the subject edited by Bengt B. Arnetz and Rolf Ekman. It is one of the first books attempting to address every possible dimension of stress — historical, cultural, biological, sociological, evolutionary, and clinical — related to both health and pathology. As such, it emphasizes the need for new, innovative paradigms born of trans-disciplinary collaboration.
In this vein, the work succeeds to pull together many different voices and perspectives from a host of predominantly Swedish, Norwegian, and American clinicians and scientists. For example, the book opens with an insightful historical exploration of stress that charts the concept’s birth (at least in the modern sense) to the early 19th century, when dramatic urban growth and changes in the speed of business, travel, and communication contributed to a sense of “nervous energy” depletion that caused “mental strain.” Thus, stress is not simply a biological or psychological phenomenon.
Each chapter is authored by a different set of authorities and remains fairly specific to their area of expertise, often directly reflecting their own research findings. These chapters explore stress through many different lenses, including that of business and management, biology, evolution, a psychosocial paradigm, and so on. The biological chapters cover many expected bases with adequate depth, including autonomic activation, the cortisol response and other endocrine outcomes, central nervous system involvement, inflammation and immune function, and metabolic effects. In addition, the psychosocial chapters add more dimension by exploring anti-stress interventions (e.g., social support), the role of sleep and fatigue, the potential link to medically unexplained syndromes, and connections to mood findings (e.g., depression), chronic pain, addiction, and the neurobiology of fear. Surprisingly, a cohesive exploration of post-traumatic stress disorder is not present, though many chapters used related findings to emphasize a point. However, trauma in early childhood and trauma related to natural catastrophes are explored in greater detail.
A benefit to compilation works such as this is the chance for perspectives from multiple disciplines to intermingle and spark dialogue. In fact, it is a striking testament to how little we really know about stress that each chapter seems to present us with an entirely new paradigm. To this end, I almost wished that other authors had been allowed to provide a short commentary after the other chapters, thereby jumpstarting some of the interesting conversations this multi-disciplinary approach will hopefully engender.
A drawback is that the quality of writing can vary greatly, particularly when dealing with nebulous concepts. Although in general the writing in the book remains lucid, some chapters falter more than others. For example, the vague observation that the “desynchronization in the [autonomic nervous system], if sustained, taxes the nervous system and bodily organs, impeding the efficient synchronization and flow of information throughout the psychophysiologic systems” provides little additional elaboration. In fact, it is interesting to note that the language is even reminiscent of the older ideas about “strained” nervous systems from the turn of the century.
One strength of the book is that each chapter is divided into organized segments with clear titles that also are provided in the Contents section, easily enabling one to scan for areas of particular interest. Searching for individual references in the body of each chapter is more difficult, however, because the reference sections are short and not all claims are directly referenced in the text.
Stress in Health and Disease may not give us all the answers, but it serves as an crucial jumping-off point for the development of future research and paradigms that will help elucidate what stress is, the mechanisms by which it affects our health, and how we can mitigate its harmful effects and harness its good ones. For this reason, it is an excellent resource for clinicians and researchers who wish to pursue some of these answers in their own work, or simply for those whose interests intersect with the topic. After all, one thing the reader can be sure of upon completion of the book is that nearly every system in the body may be affected by stress. But try not to stress too much about it, okay?
