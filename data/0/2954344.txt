A STUDY TO ASSESS DEPRESSION, ITS CORRELATES AND SUICIDAL BEHAVIOUR IN EPILEPSY

Fifty subjects with seizure disorder were compared with thirty subjects with bronchial asthma and assessed for depression and suicidal behaviour. 34% of the epilepsy group had a diagnosis of major depressive episode compared to 13.3% of Bronchial Asthma group, which demonstrated a significant difference. Complex partial seizures and use of phenobarbitone had significant association with depression. 16% of the epilepsy group had a history of atleast one suicidal attempt in the previous year with 88% using anticonvulsants. 20% of the group also expressed current suicidal ideation, which correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total scores.
