We have retrospectively analysed the experience of a musculoskeletal oncological unit in the management of adult head and neck soft tissue sarcomas from 1990 to 2005.Thirty-six patients were seen, of whom 24 were treated at this unit, the remainder only receiving advice. The median age of the patients was 46 years. Most of the sarcomas were deep and of high or intermediate grade with a median size of 5.5 cm. Eleven different histological subtypes were identified. Wide excision was possible only in 21% of the cases. 42% of the patients developed local recurrence and 42% developed metastatic disease usually in the lungs. Overall survival was 49% at 5 years. Tumour size was the most important prognostic factor. Adult head and neck soft tissue sarcomas have a high mortality rate with a high risk of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The rarity of the disease would suggest that centralisation of care could lead to increased expertise and better outcomes. 

Soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck are rare mesenchymalmalignant neoplasms accounting for less than 10% of all soft tissue sarcomasand approximately 1% of all head and neck neoplasms [1–5].  Nevertheless,they represent an important group of tumours and are associated withsignificant morbidity and mortality.
There are several histological subtypes of sarcomas which presentwith a variety of clinical characteristics and many often require treatmentwith combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. They are besttreated in specialist sarcoma units where expert multidisciplinary approach tomanagement is possible. In the UK,surgical management of soft tissue sarcomas in the head and neck region is undertakenby otolaryngologists, maxillofacial surgeons, as well as by musculoskeletalsarcoma surgeons, depending on the location of the lesion.
Reflecting the rarity of the disease, there is currently a scarcityof studies in the literature and, to our knowledge, there is only one publishedstudy that is based in a UK  hospital in the last 15 years [4]. Most of the series which are published havereported outcome over a number of decades possibly to compensate for the rarityof the disease and to increase the size of the study sample for meaningfulstatistical analysis [6]. However, the spanning of studies over several decadeshas an important drawback in that changes in the management of sarcomas andtheir outcome are not always accurately reflected.
We report on our experience of the management of adult head and necksoft tissue sarcomas presenting to a regional sarcoma centre based at anorthopaedic hospital over the past 20 years.
We have prospectively collected patient, tumour, treatment, andoutcome data on all patients with bone and soft tissue sarcomas for over 20years at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital (Birmingham, UK). We have identified all patients with softtissue sarcomas in the head and neck, defined as sites above the level of theclavicle. We have included all patients seen at the unit between 1990 and 2005.
We have made a number of observations related to patientdemographics, tumour variables, treatment modalities, outcome, and follow upfor patients with head and neck soft tissue sarcomas. Tumours were classifiedas deep if they were deep to the investing fascia whilst they were superficialif they lay purely in the subcutaneous tissues. The margins of excision wereclassified according the method of Enneking [7] with a wide margin being one inwhich a clear layer of normal tissue lay between the tumour and the excisionmargin. A marginal  excision was when the excision plane passedthrough the reactive zone around the tumour (clear but close) and anintralesional excision was when tumour was incised at any part of theoperation, even if a subsequent wide excision was achieved. Survival wasestimated using Kaplan Meier survival curves and was determined for overall5-year survival, and the log rank method was used to analyse the influence ofvarious prognostic factors on survival of the patients. For situations where noevents had arisen in one subgroup, chi-square testing was used to assesspossible significance. Institutional approval for this study was obtained.
A total of 36 patients with head and neck soft tissue sarcomas wereseen during the study period, 24 of whom were treated at this unit. This isapproximately 2% of the total 1912 cases of all soft tissue sarcomas seen atthis unit during the same period. The median age of the patients was 46 yearswith a range from 16 to 83 years. There were 24 male and 12 female patients(M : F = 2 : 1).
Thirty-five of the sarcomas were located in the neck and one waslocated in the scalp. The average duration of symptoms experienced by patientsprior to diagnosis was 54 weeks (range 1–416 weeks) andthe most commonly reported symptom was the presence of a painless lump.
The rest of the observations and analysis are based on the 24patients who received treatment at this unit. We have excluded 12 patients whowere either referred for advice only (9 patients) and received definitivetreatment elsewhere or who presented with local recurrence and/or metastasesafter previous failed treatment (3 patients). Various observations on tumours,treatment, local control, and outcome are summarised in Table 1.
The median tumour size was 5.5 cm (range 0.6–13 cm) atdiagnosis. 18 of the sarcomas (75%) were deep to the investing fascia, the restsuperficial to the fascia. Two of the sarcomas were low grade (18%), the restintermediate (42%, n = 10) or high grades (50%, n = 12). All tumours which werelocated deep to the fascia were of high or intermediate grade. Only one patient(with a Ewing's sarcoma) had lung metastases atthe time of presentation.
Eleven different histological subtypes were identified, of whichmalignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST) was the commonest subtype(25%, n = 6). The histological subtypes are listed in Table 2.
The principles of treatment used at the Unit during this timeconsisted of planned wide local excision followed by radiotherapy for all high-gradetumours >5 cm or where there were close margins of excision.
Eight patients were treated with surgery alone as initial treatmentfor their sarcomas. 13 patients had surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Twoof the three patients who had Ewing's sarcoma received neoadjuvantchemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative radiotherapy; and one receivedchemotherapy and surgery. The documented margins of excision were intralesionalin 10 (42%), marginal in 9 (37%), and wide in 5 (21%).
The patients were followed up for an average period of 50 months.Local recurrence arose in 10 patients (42%) at a median time of 14 months(range 5–96 months) following initial treatment. One of the two patients witha low-grade superficial sarcoma developed local recurrence and 9 of the 22 withhigh- or intermediate-grade sarcomas developed local recurrence. Localrecurrence was strongly related to margins achieved, arising in six of the tenwith an intralesional margin (60%), three of the nine with a marginal margin(33%), and one of the five with a wide margin (20%).
Of the ten patients who developed local recurrence, four were eitherknown to have systemic metastases already or were found to have synchronousmetastases at the time of restaging. All four received palliative treatment andall died at a median of 9 months from diagnosis of the local recurrence. Sixpatients with local recurrence had no evidence of metastases when theydeveloped the local recurrence and were treated aggressively with furthersurgical excision and radiotherapy when possible, often requiring extensivesurgical reconstructions in order to obtain wide margins of excision. Two of these patients subsequently developedmetastases 6 and 12 months later, respectively, and both subsequently died. Theother four patients remaineddisease-free at a mean of 52 months following their local recurrence.
Ten patients (42%) developed metastatic disease at a median time of17 months (range 0–139 months).Eight patients developed lung metastases and two lymph node metastases. All ofthe patients with concomitant or previous local recurrence subsequently died asdid two of the others without local recurrence. Two patients underwent surgicalresection of lung metastases and remained alive and disease-free at a median of 17 months.
Eight patients died at a median time of 2.3 years from diagnosis.Overall survival was 48.6% at five years but with wide confidence limits (plusor minus 13%) (Figure 1). We investigated the following factors for possiblesignificance on survival.
 Size. Only 1 patient with a primary sarcoma >5 cm has yet survived morethan 5 years whilst the survival for patients with tumours ≤5 cm was 71% at 5years (p = 0.02) (Figure 2). Grade. Neither of the two patients with low-grade tumours died but 8 ofthe 22 with high- or intermediate-grade tumours died (P = .29) (chi-square). Depth. None of the 6 patients with subcutaneous sarcomas died but 8 of the18 with deep tumours died (P = .0455)  (chi-square). Margin. Six of the 10 patients with intralesional and two of the 9 patientswith a marginal surgical margin died, however none of the 5 patients with awide surgical margin died (P = .04). Age. We could find no effect of age on survival.Combining these factors revealed that all deaths arosein the patients with high- or intermediate-grade deep tumours. When furtherstratified by size, this showed that two of the seven patients with high-gradedeep tumours ≤5 cm died compared with 6 of the 11 with high-grade deeptumours >5 cm (P = .04).

Head and neck sarcomas arerare and the paucity of studies about their management and outcome testifies tothis. Head and neck lumps are common and have a variety of diagnoses [2, 3].Early detection and diagnosis is clearly essential. The National Institute for Health andClinical Excellence (NICE) guidance 2005 to all UK general practitioners emphasisesthat “In patients with an unexplainedlump in the neck which has recently appeared or a lump which has not beendiagnosed before that has changed over a period of 3 to 6 weeks, an urgentreferral should be made” [8]. Whilst more general advice is alsogiven about lumps elsewhere in the body: “In patients presenting with a palpable lump,an urgent referral for suspicion of soft tissue sarcoma should be made if thelump is 
 greater than about 5 cm indiameter,  deep to fascia, fixed, orimmobile,  painful,  increasing in size,  a recurrence after previousexcision.” Our unit is a musculoskeletal unit that takes referrals of patientswith both proven or suspected sarcomas. In the case of the head and necktumours, some were referred directly to us for investigation and diagnosiswhilst others were referred after a biopsy or imaging had confirmed thediagnosis of a sarcoma. We treated patients with sarcomas that were confined tothe superficial tissues or deep muscles of the head and neck and we have not includedpatients with soft tissue sarcomas involving the facial skeleton or theoropharynx which pose even greater challenges in treatment [6].
 greater than about 5 cm indiameter,

 a recurrence after previousexcision.” 
Our management policy was based on principles used in treating softtissue sarcomas at other sites. The head and neck poses particular problemshowever because of the proximity of so many important structures and the nearimpossibility of obtaining wide surgical margins in many cases. Unlike limbsoft tissue sarcomas, there is no fallback option of doing an amputation iflocal recurrence arises.
The local recurrence rates for high-grade soft tissue sarcomas aftersurgical excision havebeen reported to be as high as 50% in the literature [3, 9, 10]. 42%of patients developed local recurrence in our study, most arising within 2years of treatment. Barker et al. in their study reported the median time tolocal recurrence after treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy to be 4months, and Kraus et al. reported that patients who developed local recurrencedid so within 3 years [11, 12].
The risk of local recurrence was higher with intralesional ormarginal surgical margins as has been shown by other authors [2, 12]. In view ofthis, every effort should be made to maximise the margins that can be achievedat the time of the first surgical procedure, if necessary by going back anddoing a further wide excision if the initial margins prove positive. Allpatients should have their case discussed at a multidisciplinary team meetingand the option of radiotherapy considered to try and decrease the risk of localrecurrence. Even if patients do developlocal recurrence, their case is not hopeless and further excision should beconsidered. Clearly, however, initial wide surgical margins should always beaimed for.
The commonest site for metastases was the lungs which was also thecommonest cause  of death. Mendenhall et al. [3] suggested that patients shouldundergo a chest CT before treatment and also suggested that in the absence ofpulmonary metastases, other distant metastases are highly unlikely. We concurwith this.
The 5-year survival rate of 49% in our study (Figure 1) iscomparable to a previous UK study by Eeles et al. [4] based at the RoyalMarsden Hospital of London. They analysed 103 cases seen over 44 years between1944 and 1988 and reported 50% overall 5-year survival rate. This is similar tothe results reported by Bentz et al. [6] from Memorial Sloan Kettering CancerCentre. Most authors agree that the sameprognostic factors apply to sarcomas no matter where they arise—grade, size, anddepth. In the head and neck, however, local recurrence has more sinisterportents because of the difficulty of subsequent management [5, 13–18].
Obtaining local control is paramount in managing these head and necksarcomas. Obtaining wide margins may often require a multidisciplinary teamconsisting of a sarcoma surgeon, a head and neck surgeon and a reconstructivesurgeon. A clinical oncologist is an essential part of the team to advise aboutradiotherapy usage. A metaanalysis publishedin Lancet revealed that chemotherapy did not produce a survival benefit in thetreatment of soft tissue sarcomas [19]. The same analysis did, however, show a 10% benefit of chemotherapy on recurrence-freesurvival. Adjuvant chemotherapy is not usually advocated for localisedsoft tissue sarcomas but can be considered for metastatic disease as apalliative treatment.
Recent guidance from NICE, UK  [20] in themanagement of patients with sarcomas has highlighted the importance ofreferring all patients with soft tissue sarcomas to a sarcoma centre where theycan be managed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT). The guidance has alsoemphasised the importance of close collaboration between these sarcoma MDTs andsite-specific head and neck surgeons and oncologists. This has been emphasisedby the recent paper of Harb et al. [21]. We recommend that all surgeons whoidentify a suspected or proven soft tissue sarcoma of the head and neck shouldrefer that patient to a sarcoma MDT and that all head and neck cancer MDTsshould have close links with the local sarcoma MDT for management of thesecases.
