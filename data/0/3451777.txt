Medication-overuse headache:citalopram associated with analgesics withdrawal as possibletreatment

Medication-overuse headaches are a relevant medical andsocial problem, for which specific treatments have not yet beendefined. In patients with chronic daily headache who takeanalgesics every day, this headache is most likely to be causedby drugs and will vanish with abstinence. Nonetheless, there isanecdotal evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRI) are effective in chronic daily headache, because of theconcomitant presence of psychiatric comorbidities (depression,anxiety, or a combination of both). Six migraineurs wereadmitted to the Neurology Clinic for medicationoveruse headacheand associated depression, anxiety and behavioural changes.Treatment consisted in suppressing other drugs and by using anSSRI, citalopram, at modest dosage (â‰¤30 mg daily). Analgesicwithdrawal was performed in hospital and was not particularlyproblematic. Over a 1-year follow-up, pain coping strategiesameliorated and depression decreased; drug withdrawal was easy,even from barbiturates, and pain control was good. Furtherinvestigation into the possible use of citalopram or other SSRIsin medication-overuse headache is waranted.
