The HLA system in the families of patients with juvenile diabetes mellitus

The HLA and Bf genotypes were determined in 10 families with one or more children with JDM. A statistically significant association was found between HLA-D-identity and the chance to present JDM within a sibship. No such association was detectable with the SD antigens. A highly significant increase in the frequency of intra-HLA recombination was also found in these families.
