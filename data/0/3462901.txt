Figure 1 has been corrected to show that the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) produces NADPH, and to reinforce the fact that p53 is intracellular.Fig. 1p53 signalling in glucose metabolism. p53 can suppress the transcription of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 (and via NFκB inhibits GLUT3) along with the insulin receptor to inhibit cellular glucose uptake. By transcriptional activation of TIGAR, p53 can suppress the rate of glycolysis and increase diversion of glycolytic intermediates into the PPP. p53 can also suppress glycolysis by promoting the degradation of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). By activating the transcription of hexokinase II (HK II) p53 can stimulate glycolysis. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) forms part of the malate/aspartate shuttle that links glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration; MDH1 binds to and modulates the activity of p53
