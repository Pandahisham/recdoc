Neuropathology of heavy metal intoxication.

The basis for utilizing altered morphology, i.e., pathology, in defining diseases of the nervous system is presented. The importance of recognizing the dynamics of pathologic processes is emphasized, particularly in understanding the pathogenesis of neural diseases. Demonstrative examples of the neuropathology of human heavy metal toxicity are presented. The limitations of descriptive pathology are considered, and the potentials of quantitative (morphometric) analysis for studying pathologic processes are introduced.
