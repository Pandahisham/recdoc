Effective Inferior Vena Cava Filtering; A Brief Communication


The patient was a 76 year old woman. Three weeks before she was hospitalized with diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage due to motor vehicle accident. During hospital course the patient developed deep vein thrombosis so she was consulted for Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter implantation. 10 days before an IVC filter (Optease, Cordis, Miamai) was implanted in IVC. IVC venography before implantation showed no clot in IVC (the picture was not shown). In retrieval session ten days after implantation we do perform IVC venography (Figure 1 and 2). Retreival was canceled and the patient remained on anticoagulant therapy.
