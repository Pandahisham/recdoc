Nonmelanoma skin cancers (squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas) occur at an epidemic rate in many countries with the worldwide incidence increasing. The sun-exposed head and neck are the most frequent sites for these cancers to arise and in most patients diagnosed with a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, local treatment is usually curative. However, a subset is diagnosed with a high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. High-risk factors include size (>2 cm), thickness/depth of invasion (>4 mm), recurrent lesions, the presence of perineural invasion, location near the parotid gland, and immunosuppression. These patients have a higher risk (>10–20%) of developing metastases to regional lymph nodes (often parotid nodes), and in some cases also of experiencing local morbidity (perineural invasion), based on unfavourable primary lesion and patient factors. Despite treatment, many patients developing metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma experience mortality and morbidity usually as a consequence of uncontrolled metastatic nodal disease. It is therefore important that clinicians treating nonmelanoma skin cancers have an understanding and awareness of these high-risk patients. The aim of this article is to discuss the factors that define a high-risk patient and to present some of the issues pertinent to their management.

Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC) are a major public health concernin Australia [1] and around the world and although most patients are cured, a minority will die of cutaneous SCC (cSCC), usually in the setting of metastases to regional lymph nodes of the head and neck (HN) [2]. Most lesions (80–90%)develop on the sun-exposed HN in older Caucasian males with theoverall incidence of patients with a cSCC developing metastases toregional lymph nodes reported as low (<5%)[3].
The majority of patients treated in the community with a small(<2 cm), thin (<4 mm), and previously untreated cSCCwill not develop nodal metastases and can be classified aslow-risk. However, the incidence of nodal metastases in patientsreferred to a tertiary referral hospital is often much higher(10–20%) secondary to patients having high-risk factors[4–6]. Patients with high-risk cSCC have a higher risk ofdeveloping metastases to regional lymph nodes based on bothunfavorable primary lesion and also patient factors(Table 1).
The definition of a patient with a high-risk cSCC is oftenunderappreciated by clinicians and is not well documented in theliterature. The current TNM (tumor, node, metastases) stagingsystem for cSCC does not incorporate important prognostic factors(discussed below) such as thickness/depth of invasionwhen assigning T stage [7]. Size alone (e.g., T1 ≤ 2 cm) is the main criterion used. With emerging data onhigh-risk cSCC and the risk associated with other factors there isa need to investigate an improved and more prognostic stagingsystem. Similarly, pathology reports often lack important datasuch as thickness/depth of invasion, grade or the presence ofperineural and lymphovascular invasion. As well, factors such aslesion location and the patient's immune state are also importantto note. In a recent comprehensive review Cassarino et al. [6] attempted to classify histological subtypes of cSCC based on themetastatic potential they exhibit. High-risk (>10% risk)subtypes included de novo cSCC and cSCC arising is associationwith predisposing factors (e.g., immunosuppression, burn scars).
Despite some limitations, patients with high risk cSCC can beidentified and clinicians should be aware so that appropriatemanagement can be recommended. The aim of this article is todiscuss those factors that make a patient diagnosed with a cSCC athigher risk of developing metastases.
Lesion size is reported as an important predictor for developingnodal metastases. However size alone is probably aweak independent predictor although many studies report athreshold size of approximately 2 cm beyond which patientshave an increasing propensity to metastases to nodes. Ina series of 200 patients with cSCC, 12.5% developed metastaticcSCC with the authors reporting a significant difference in therate of nodal metastases from various primary sites of the HNusing a 2 cm threshold size (13% versus 68%; P = .004)[4]. In a large review Rowe et al. [8] reported the incidence of metastases was 30% for cSCC >2 cm versus 9% for cSCC <2 cm. Mullen et al. [9] identified tumor size >2 cm as an independent predictor on univariate analysis for recurrence or death, although size did not remain asignificant predictor on multivariate analysis. In a study ofpatients with metastatic cSCC to HN nodes, the authors comparedthe data to nonmetastatic historical controls and found adifference in the number of patients with cSCC >2 cm (19%nonmetastatic versus 81% metastatic) [10]. Moore et al. [5] reported median lesion size as highly significant (3 cm versus 2 cm; P = .0002) in a study of 40 patientswith metastatic cSCC when compared to 153 cSCC patients withoutmetastases. Veness et al. [11] reported median size of cSCC of only 1.5 cm with only 30% of patients having a cSCC>2 cm in a large study of 266 patients with metastatic nodalcSCC of the HN. This latter study would suggest that other factors(i.e., tumor thickness, site, etc.) are also likely to contributeto the risk of developing metastases. Of note, 20–30% ofpatients may not have an identifiable nearby high-risk indexlesion in the setting of nodal metastases. However, most patientsinvariably will have had a past history of NMSC treated in the HN.
Thickness (or depth of invasion) is an important predictor ofmetastases. Depth of invasion >4 mm is associated with anincreasing risk. In a study of patients with lower lip SCC, therewas a significant difference in mean depth of invasion in nodenegative patients compared with those developing nodal metastases(4.2 mm versus 11.2 mm; P < .001) [12]. In another study of patients with metastatic cSCC of the HN only 17% with a lesion <4 mm metastasised compared with 83% withlesions >4 mm [9].
Patients with lesions <4 mm thick have a low incidence ofnodal metastases. A large study of 550 patients with 594 cSCC(including 149 lip SCC) documented a 4% rate of nodalmetastases with only 7 patients (2.9%) with a tumour ≤5 mm thick developing metastases compared with 14 (17.5%)patients with a tumour >5 mm thick. Of note, no patient witha superficial cSCC (<2 mm thick) developed metastases[13].
Clark levels are also prognostic with one study reporting patientswith metastatic cSCC significantly (P = .0001) more likely to havecSCC invading beyond Clark level III compared to those withoutmetastases [4]. In a large review of prognostic factors in patients with cSCC, those with a tumor <4 mm or Clark levelsI–III had a metastatic rate of 6.7% compared to 45.7% inthose with a tumor >4 mm or Clark level IV-V [8].
Up to 50% of patients with a positive margin with a cSCC willlocally recur with a subsequent increased risk ofdeveloping nodal metastases [14]. In a study of patients with lip SCC, those with recurrent lip SCC experienced asignificant difference in nodal metastases compared with those notdeveloping local recurrence (15% versus 2%; P < .0001) [15]. In a large review of the literature, patients experienced a 32% and 45% incidence of nodal metastases in the setting of recurrent lip SCC and ear SCC, respectively[8].
There is no consensus in regards to the definition of anacceptable surgical margin in cSCC. In a series of patientsundergoing intraoperative frozen section analysis to achieve aminimum of a 3 mm surgical margin, only 3% recurred with amedian follow up of 5.1 years [16]. Another study of patients with cSCC <2 cm in diameter found that with a 4 mmexcision margin 95% had negative excision margins. With lesions>2 cm a 6 mm margin would achieve a 95% rate ofnegative excision margins [17]. The authors subsequently recommended 6 mm margins with high-grade tumours or thoselocated in high-risk areas. In concordance with these findings inanother study of 150 excised NMSC (25% cSCC) a 4 mmsurgical margin resulted in clearance in 97% of cases comparedwith a 2 mm excision margin achieving this in only 78% ofcases [18]. In one study of metastatic cSCC to HN nodes 51% of patients developing nodal metastases had a recurrentprimary lesion [19]. Therefore a recommendation ofobservation in patients with an inadequately excised cSCC(<4 mm) must be considered very carefully in light of theincreased risk of metastatic nodal disease in the recurrentsetting. Further surgery or adjuvant radiotherapy should berecommended.
Poorly differentiated cSCC are more likely to be associated withthe development of regional metastases. In a study of 571 patientswith cSCC, there was a significant difference in the rate ofmetastases for high-grade lesions compared to other grades (17%versus 4%; P = .004) [20]. The incidence of poorly differentiated lesions in one series of patients with metastaticcSCC was significantly increased in patients developing metastases(44% versus 5%; P < .01) [4]. There are also data that desmoplastic SCC, an aggressive histological variant of SCC, possesses a high propensity to regional metastasesespecially with increasing tumor thickness. Using Broder'sclassification, over a quarter of patients (27%) in one studywith a desmoplastic SCC were assigned as grade IV differentiationcompared to only 11% with a nondesmoplastic cSCC [13].
Perineural invasion (PNI) occurs in ∼5% of patientswith cSCC and is usually an incidental finding but is reported tobe associated with a higher incidence of nodal metastases comparedto patients without PNI. In a large study from MD Anderson, Texas,there was a significant increase in both regional (35% versus15%; P < .0005) and distant metastases (15% versus 3.3%; P < .0005) for patients diagnosed with PNI compared to those without [20]. In a large study of 135 patients with PNI and treated with radiotherapy +/− surgery, half of all failures in patients with microscopic PNI were in regional nodes, promptingthe authors to recommend elective nodal treatment in patients withPNI [21]. A study comparing prognostic features of patients with metastatic and nonmetastatic lip SCC also reported a highlysignificant difference in the presence of PNI (41% versus5%; P < .0001) [22].
It should also be noted that PNI may also lead to significantmorbidity and mortality from the involvement of cranial nerves(usually facial or trigeminal) leading to skull base/intracranialspread. The optimal treatment of patients with PNI remains unclearalthough wide field radiotherapy is an important modality in manypatients. Patients diagnosed even with focal PNI, especially iflocated in the periorbital region, should be recommendedappropriated treatment. The finding of PNI away from the actualtumor mass, and often extending to excision margins, indicatesprogressive perineural spread and a need for further treatment.Recent data from the University of Florida suggests patients withasymptomatic microscopic (incidental) PNI have a significantlybetter outcome compared to patients presenting with clinically orradiologically positive PNI (local control at 5 years 87%versus 55%; P = .0006) [21, 23].
Patients with cSCC located within the lymphatic drainage of theparotid gland (on or around the external ear, temple, forehead,anterior scalp) or lower lip are associated with a higherincidence of metastases. The scalp is often a site for high-riskcSCC and, in particular, patients can develop satellite orin-transit metastases which carry a poor prognosis[24]. Most patients developing metastatic nodal cSCC of the HN do so to the parotid and/or upper cervical nodes [24, 25].There are advocates of elective nodal dissection in selecthigh-risk patients with lesions located on theear/preauricular region [26, 27] and lip [28].Accurately predicting patients that may develop nodal relapse isdifficult, however, clinicians should consider patients withrecurrent SCC that are >4 mm thick and in the vicinity ofthe parotid gland (ear, lateral scalp, forehead, temple, cheek) athigher risk of developing parotid nodal metastases. It is thesepatients that should be considered as candidates for the electivetreatment of parotid nodes. Depending on the type of treatment tothe primary cutaneous lesion, elective nodal treatment may entaileither a superficial parotidectomy, or alternatively, radiotherapyto the parotid gland.
Immunosuppression, particularly in the setting of an organtransplantation recipient (OTR), often leads to significantmorbidity from NMSC, usually cSCC. A subset of cSCC in OTR isaggressive in nature with rapid growth and the development ofregional and distant metastases. In an Australian study of 619cardiothoracic transplant recipients, 26 developed an aggressiveNMSC with most diagnosed with a poorly differentiated cSCC[29]. Death occurred in 13 of the 26 with 10 patients dying from systemic disease. Martinez et al. [30] reported the outcome of 60 OTR all with metastatic skin cancer (85% cSCC)noting that 27% of patients had an unknown index lesion. Inthis study median primary lesion size was 12 mm and mediandepth of invasion was 3.2 mm. Three-year disease specificsurvival was only 56%. This would suggest a smaller lesion sizeand lesser depth of invasion associated with the development ofmetastatic cSCC and a significantly worse outcome compared withimmunocompetent (IC) patients. In another study comparing IC andOTR patients a significant proportion of OTR had thick(>5 mm) tumors and exhibited early dermal invasion comparedwith IC patients [31]. Of note, patients immunosuppressed as a consequence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) also have asimilar increased risk of cutaneous SCC and poor outcome fromdeveloping metastases [32]. In many cases, the level of immunosuppression cannot be markedly reduced. The basic tenets ofobtaining adequate surgical margins and examining for PNI areespecially applicable to this group of patients.Adjuvant radiotherapy to incompletely excised cSCC, orthose with PNI, should be strongly considered. Close liaison witha transplant physician is also important.
Recent evidence suggests that the presence of lymphovascularinvasion may increase the risk of developing nodal metastases.Moore et al. [5] documented lymphovascular invasion as an independent predictor of nodal metastases on multivariate analysis(OR 7.54; P < .00001). In this study 40% of patients withnodal metastases had lymphovascular invasion compared with only8% of node negative patients. Other studies of high-risk cSCCalso report the presence of lymphovascular invasion although failto find any significant impact on outcome [2–4].
The consequences of cSCC in dermal lymphatic vessels, which isuncommonly reported, is unclear but may increase a patient's riskof relapse and may explain the phenomenon of in-transit metastases[33]. Patients that develop in-transit metastases are best treated with wide field high-dose radiotherapy encompassing thesites of gross disease plus generous 4-5 cm margins to treatpotential subclinical dermal lymphatic spread.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has created analgorithm to aid clinicians [34]. While not entirelyevidenced-based, the authors consider patients with tumors ≥4 mm thick, Clark level IV-V, moderate to poor differentiation, PNI present and recurrent as high-risk and recommend wide excision (10 mm margins if achievable) andadjuvant radiotherapy if warranted. No specific recommendation ismade on the elective treatment of regional nodes in high-riskpatients. The British Association of Dermatologists recentlypublished guidelines for managing a patient with cSCC [35]. Patients were considered at greater risk of local recurrence anddeveloping metastases based on six variables: site (lip, ear,non-sun-exposed sites), size (>2 cm), depth (>4 mm orClark level V), grade (poorly differentiated), hostimmunosuppression (immunosuppressed), and presentation(recurrent). The guidelines did not support electively treatinglymph nodes because of insufficient evidence. The American Academyof Dermatologists also recommended patients with selectedrecurrent cSCC and those with increased biological aggressivenessto undergo Moh's micrographic surgery [36]. No recommendation was made on electively treating lymph nodes in high-risk patients. The International Transplant-Skin Cancer Collaboration (ITSCC)recently published guidelines for managing OTR withcSCC [37]. All features considered high-risk in non-OTR patients were also deemed high-risk in OTR patients although theauthors considered a much lower size threshold (>0.6 cm for“mask” facial area and >1 cm for cheek, forehead, scalp).Moh's micrographic surgery was recommended or alternatively widelocal excision with 6–10 mm margins.
Clinicians managing patients with high-risk cSCC need to considermultiple factors prior to recommending that furthertreatment with radiotherapy is an important option in manypatients (Table 2). Patients will often have manyhigh-risk factors and therefore the benefit from recommending, forexample, wide field adjuvant radiotherapy, may justify thepotential toxicity and cost. The evidence for many clinicalsettings is still emerging and further research is needed.
There are only limited data to guide clinicians on the role ofsentinel node biopsy (SNB) in HN NMSC. In a recent largesystematic review on the topic, a total of 692 patients wereidentified, however only 85 patients had a nonanogenital cSCC andmany of these were extremity lesions [38]. Many studies have also reported on lip SCC although as previously discussed cSCClocated around the parotid/upper neck carry the highest risk ofdeveloping nodal metastases. Further studies are still needed tobetter define the role of SNB in HN NMSC.
Most patients with cSCC will not develop nodal metastases andtherefore IC patients with small (<2 cm), thin(<4 mm), adequately excised (>4 mm margins), andpreviously untreated cSCC are not candidates for furthertreatment. However, accurately predicting patients at high-riskand, therefore, justifying the elective treatment of first echelonlymph nodes is difficult. Despite this, patients withmore than one high-risk factor (thick/deeply invasive>4 mm, >2 cm in diameter, located near the parotidgland, especially in the recurrent setting) should be consideredat risk of developing nodal metastases. In such cases, electivetreatment (surgery or radiotherapy) to first echelon nodes may beof benefit and referral to a multidisciplinary head and neckcancer service is encouraged [39]. At a minimum, patients should be followed closely (2-3 months) for at least 3-4 yearssince late nodal relapse is well documented.
