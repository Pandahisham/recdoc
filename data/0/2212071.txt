THE ISOLATION AND ASSAY OF HYPERTENSIN FROM BLOOD

 A method has been described for isolation and assay of hypertensin from the blood of dogs. An ethanol filtrate of blood drawn from the femoral artery is prepared and concentrated by evaporation. The hypertensin is extracted into n-butanol from which it is adsorbed into alumina, and subsequently eluted with dilute ethanol. The eluate is then evaporated to dryness, dissolved in water, and assayed by intravenous injection into rats.
