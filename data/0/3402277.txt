An editorial error occurred in the article listed above. The sentence “We thank Conway for his comment (1) on our article in Diabetes Care (2) on the risk of diabetes associated with elevated transferrin saturation levels in two follow-up studies (risk as hazard ratios and exposure preceding disease) and a case-control study (risk as odds ratio) with neither study being cross-sectional” should have read as follows: “We thank Conway for her comment (1) on our article in Diabetes Care (2) on the risk of diabetes associated with elevated transferrin saturation levels in two follow-up studies (risk as hazard ratios and exposure preceding disease) and a case-control study (risk as odds ratio) with neither study being cross-sectional.” The online version has been corrected.
