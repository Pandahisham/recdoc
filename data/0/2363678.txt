Modulation of TcR/CD3-zeta chain expression by a circulating factor derived from ovarian cancer patients

In women with ovarian cancer, suppression of components of the immune system may promote tumour development. Previous studies in ovarian cancer have demonstrated that decreased expression and function of the T-cell receptor (TcR)-associated signal transducing zeta-chain correlates with deficient immune responsiveness of T cells. In this study, sera and ascitic fluids obtained from woman with advanced ovarian cancer were found to suppress the expression of TcR-associated zeta chain. This suppression of zeta chain expression was dose-dependent and was not observed with biologic fluids obtained from healthy women. Â© 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com
