CHEMICAL STUDIES ON INTESTINAL INFANTILISM 

 In my three cases of intestinal infantilism, the kreatinin excretion was more irregular than normally, and the kreatinin coefficient was low. Kreatin was found in the urine on a kreatin-free diet. The sum of kreatinin and kreatin was also irregular. The endogenous uric acid was irregular from day to day. The kreatin excretion is apparently lower on a high fat diet than on a high carbohydrate diet.
