Two Welsh surveys of blood lead and blood pressure.

The relationship between blood pressure and blood lead was examined in two population samples. One of these consisted of 1137 men aged 49 to 65 years, the other of 865 men and 856 women aged 18 to 64 years. Neither population had any known important exposure to lead, and the 95% ranges of blood lead levels were 6 to 26 micrograms/100 mL and 6 to 23 micrograms/mL in the men and 5 to 18 micrograms/100 mL in the women. No significant relationship between blood pressure and blood lead was detected in either of the population samples, and the regression coefficients suggest that if there were a real effect, then the mean difference in blood pressure per 10 micrograms difference in blood lead is likely to be 0.7 mm Hg in both systolic and diastolic pressures. In the survey of 1137 men, the rise in blood pressure was measured during the cold pressor test. This test is likely to be affected if lead were to affect neurogenic mediators of blood pressure. The mean change in systolic pressure was 24 mm Hg and the 95% range was -6 to 60 mm Hg, but there was no evidence of any association with blood lead level.
