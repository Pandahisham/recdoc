Use of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine in individuals with asthma or a history of wheezing


To the Editor,
In their review of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), Esposito et al. stated that in the US and Europe, LAIV is not recommended for children and adults with asthma and children younger than 5 years of age with a history of recurrent wheezing.1 While this statement is accurate for the US, it is not accurate for the European Union. The European Medicines Agency approved LAIV for use in children and adolescents 24 months to younger than 18 years of age, with a warning against use in children and adolescents with severe asthma or active wheezing because these individuals have not been adequately studied in clinical studies.2 However, based on studies that have been conducted, in the European Union there is no warning against LAIV use in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma or a history of recurrent wheezing.2 In the European Union, LAIV is not approved for use in adults 18 years of age and older.
