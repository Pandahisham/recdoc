In this article, published online 26 January 2012, there is an error in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Results section. In the sentence “Combined, the bias was +567 cm3 with 95% limits of agreement of −355 to +468 cm3 (Figure 3b),” “+567 cm3” should have been “+56 cm3”.
In addition, it came to the authors' attention that the Disclosure statement did not properly list the conflict information for Cynthia E. Davis. The correct statement is shown below:
M.P.R., W.K.W., D.L.E., and C.E.D. are employees of the funding company, GE Healthcare, or its affiliates. All the other authors declared no conflict of interest.
