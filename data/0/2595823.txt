Truth and fancy in the management of the solitary thyroid nodule.

Although there is considerable controversy about the proper management of the solitary nodule, certain information may be useful in reaching this decision. Age, sex, and a previous history of external irradiation to the head and neck are helpful as are the clinical characteristics of the thyroid gland. Whether the nodule is functioning or "cold" on thyroid scan, and cystic or solid on thyroid ultrasound is also helpful. Based on these findings, the physician must decide whether to recommend surgery or thyroid hormone suppressive therapy.
