SUNCT: a new case with some unusual features

A healthy 22–year–oldman complained of primary stabbingheadache (PSH) for about twomonths. The headache recurredafter one year and after a month thepain took on the characteristics ofshort–lasting unilateral neuralgiformheadache with conjunctival injectionand tearing (SUNCT). Thispatient shows some unusual features:juvenile onset, miosis duringattacks as part of autonomic phenomenaand close temporal relationshipwith stressful events. Theassociation between PSH andSUNCT may be interpreted as thecoexistence of two differentheadaches or that the PSH is a forerunnerto the SUNCT.
