EXPERIMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY OF TUBERCULOSIS 

 1. After intraperitoneal inoculation of guinea pigs with tubercle bacilli, the microorganisms may appear in the feces and elimination may persist during 1 week. Subsequently during several weeks no tubercle bacilli can be recovered from the feces. 2. When tuberculosis is widely disseminated in the body of guinea pigs, tubercle bacilli are discharged with the feces. 3. Tubercle bacilli are occasionally eliminated in the bile of guinea pigs immediately after inoculation but are almost constantly found in the bile after several weeks when the disease is well established. 4. Tubercle bacilli are eliminated in the urine of experimentally infected guinea pigs only when infection is far advanced.
