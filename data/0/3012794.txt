LONG STAY PATIENTS IN A STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL

A study of the long stay patients in a state mental hospital on 30th June 1980 revealed that 70 per cent of the total 1,434, i.e. 1015 had spent more than two years continuously; most of them are chronic schizophrenics, admitted by the police, lacking social support. The need for rehabilitating them both within and outside the hospital is stressed.
