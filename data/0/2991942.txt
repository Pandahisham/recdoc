Pharmacological treatment in mental health disorders after trauma


The treatment of psychological trauma depends partially on the type of emotional problem being presented, the time that has passed since the traumatic event(s), and the availability of means. However, it should be stressed that cognitive and behavioural treatment approaches work very well.
This presentation will focus on the pharmacological treatment of the psychological sequels of trauma, reviewing the literature on effective drug treatment. Results: Almost all types of psychiatric medication have been tried in order to alleviate the psychological symptoms associated with trauma. The most efficacious are considered to be the antidepressants.
The best results are anticipated with a treatment combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, individual or in groups.
