From the Editor's desk


Dear All,
The journal in your hand “Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research” (JAPTR) has received a wide acclaim and response from the scholar and academicians of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The journal as such is exclusively meant for promoting research impact in Pharmaceutical Sciences with a view to encourage the new scholar and the established once for their experiences. The first two issues of the journal, the second one presently in your hand were published in electronic version which can be seen online. As a matter of fact, the first issue has encouraged the Editor to think a new plan, to bring it into print as the hard copy of it. Till its publication in hard copy, the Editor invites the suggestions, modifications and addition, if any, for its better format.
On my part, I remain with the assurance that the next issues (both electronic and print form) of the journal will be more academic and research oriented and will serve the need (s) of the students and scholar alike.
I would also like to experience and to express my sincere thanks to the reviewer's who have helped the Editor and the journal for recommending standard articles to be published in the journal.
I cannot deny the co-operation and help being offered to me by the reviewer's in the selection of articles and the suggestions for the academic standard of the journal.
I hope they will also help me with the same sprit and enthusiasm for the next issues and for making it a referred journal in times to come.
With kind regards and expecting your whole hearted support.
