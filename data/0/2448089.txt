Post-transfusion hepatitis: a problem in Northern Ireland?

A retrospective analysis of post-transfusion hepatitis reported to us from 1980 through 1984 revealed 16 patients. We believe that this apparently low incidence is due to lack of notification and make a case for direct notification to us of any suspected cases. Disqualification of implicated blood donors is of prime importance in prevention of transfusion-associated hepatitis.
