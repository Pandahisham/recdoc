Differential diagnosis between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis is still difficult to establish. In63 patients with suspected pancreatic neoplasm we performed: serum CA 19-9 assessment, abdominalultrasound, CT scan and CT-guided pancreatic percutaneous fine-needle biopsy. The conclusive diagnosiswas pancreatic cancer in 40 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 23 patients. With regard to the differentialdiagnosis, sensitivity and specificity were respectively 80% and 78%  for serum CA 19-9, 75%  and 65%  forabdominal US, 85% and 70%  for CT scan, 00% and 87%  for percutaneous fine-needle biopsy. Weconclude that CT-guided percutaneous fine-needle biopsy is the most reliable method for differentialdiagnosis between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis.
