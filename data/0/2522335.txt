The relationships of renal and glomerular hypertrophies to development of hyperfiltration and proteinuria early in streptozotocin-induced diabetes were explored. Control, diabetic, phlorizin-treated controls, and diabetic male Fischer rats were used. Phlorizin (an Na+-glucose cotransport inhibitor) was given at a dose sufficient to normalize blood glucose.  Inulin clearance (Cinulin) and protein excretion rate (PER) were measured. For morphometry, kidney sections were stained with periodic acid Schiff.  At one week, diabetes PER increased 2.8-folds (P < .001), Cinulin increased 80% (P < .01). Kidney wet and dry weights increased 10%–12% (P < .05), and glomerular tuft area increased 9.3% (P < .001). Phlorizin prevented proteinuria, hyperfiltration, and kidney hypertrophy, but not glomerular hypertrophy. Thus, hyperfiltration, proteinuria, and whole kidney hypertrophy were related to hyperglycemia but not to glomerular growth. Diabetic glomerular hypertrophy constitutes an early event in the progression of glomerular pathology which occurs in the absence of mesangial expansion and persists even after changes in protein excretion and GFR are reversed through glycemic control.

Nephropathy occurs inabout 35% of patients with diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy isresponsible for the majority of kidney dialysis and transplants [1]. Renalhyperfiltration and hypertrophy are early manifestations of diabeticnephropathy and much research has been devoted to elaborate if these are majorcontributors to development of overt renal disease.
Glomerular growth has been seen as the initial renal event in diabetesand found to precede tubular growth [2]. It was believed that glomerular growthwith the associated increase in surface area for filtration as observed indiabetic animals and patients [3, 4] is amajor determinant of renal hyperfiltration [5].
Others suggest instead that hyperfiltrationis the initial event and is thought to occur as a consequence of a decreasedafferent arteriolar tone in hyperglycemia, probably mediated by earlyglycosylation products [6]. Excess filtration then would lead to glomerularhypertension and hypertrophy of glomerular cells in response to excessive stretch[7, 8], resulting eventually in glomerular sclerosis [9].
Recently, it has been proposed that whole kidney growth precedes [10] and leads tohyperfiltration [11, 12], with a major contribution of tubular rather than of glomerularhypertrophy to the development of hyperfiltration through alteredtubuloglomerular feedback. It is proposed that in uncontrolled diabetesthere is an increased tubular Na+-glucose reabsorption [13], due to theincrease in filtered glucose load and to increased expression of SGLT1, SGLT2and GLUT2 transporters in proximal tubule cells [14]. The decreased distaldelivery of Na+ will cause an increase in GFR throughtubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) [12, 15].
Although renal (glomerular and tubular) growth and hyperfiltration may contributesignificantly to development of overt diabetic nephropathy [9], theinterrelationships between these early renal diabetic events are not clear.Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the importance of glomerularand renal morphological changes to the development of hyperfiltration andproteinuria in early experimental diabetes, and to study the effect of blockingtubular Na+-glucose reabsorption on glomerular and renalhypertrophic growth and on hyperfiltration and proteinuria.
Male Fischer rats (8 weeks old) were placed in a room with an 8:00–20:00 light, 20:00–8:00 dark cycle,kept at 22.3 ± 0.3°C and 31.2 ± 0.8% humidity. The rats had free access to water and standardrat chow (801151, Special Diets Services, UK). All animals were cared for inaccordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals andall experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the ResearchAdministration Committee at Kuwait University. Four groupswere used: control rats (C), diabetic rats (D), diabetic rats treated withPhlorizin (DPLZ), and control (nondiabetic) rats treated with phlorizin (CPLZ).This group was added to study any direct renal effects of phlorizin.
Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p)injection of 55 mg/kg Streptozotocin (STZ, S-0130, Sigma, USA),dissolved in 50 mM trisodium-citrate buffer, pH = 4.5. Controls were given thecitrate buffer (vehicle) alone. After STZ injection, animals were placed inmetabolic cages and development of diabetes was confirmed 16 hours later ifpronounced glucosuria and polyuria developed.
Diabetic (DPLZ) and control rats (CPLZ) were treated with phlorizin (P-3449, Sigma, USA)starting 16 hours after STZ or citrate buffer IP injection.Phlorizin was dissolved at room temperature in propylene glycol(1,2-propanediol, 82282, Fluka, Switzerland). The first day the rats were given a total of 400 mg/kg phlorizin s.c. split into doses of 200 mg/kg at 8:00 AM and at 8:00 PM. The second day the dosewas raised to 400 mg/kg twice daily and the treatment was continued for 6 days [16].
Blood glucose levels were measured twice daily in the treatment group onsamples taken from the tail, using a glucometer (GLUCOTREND 2, Roche, Germany).Nonfasting blood glucose levels were measured in all groups before sacrifice, 7days after treatment.
Urinary protein concentration was measured using amodified Lowry assay [17]. Protein excretion rate (PER) was calculated fromurinary protein concentration (Up, mg/ml) and urine flow rate (V, ml/24hrs).The urine samples were collected over twenty four hours from rats placed inmetabolic cages.
To assess tubular proteinuria, the urinary excretion of beta2-microglobulinwas tested. The concentration of beta2-microglobulin in rat urinewas measured using beta2-Microglobulin PET Kit (K 0052, DAKO, Denmark).Changes in absorbance read at 340 nm (Hitachi model911, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) were proportional to theconcentration of beta2-microglobulin in standards of knownconcentrations. The urinary excretion rate of beta2-microglobulinwas calculated from its urinary concentration and the urine flow rate.
Glomerular filtration ratewas estimated by measuring the renal plasma clearance of inulin (Cinulin).Each rat was weighed and anaesthetized with Inactin (Thiobutabarbital sodium C10H15N2NaO2S,T-133, Sigma, UK) at a dose of 100 mg/kg IP. Theleft femoral artery was catheterized for continuous monitoring of arterialblood pressure by a pressure transducer. Blood samples were collected from thearterial catheter. Tracheostomy was performed to insure proper ventilation. Thefemoral vein was catheterized and an infusion with sterile Ringer's solution (154 mMNaCl, 5.61 mM KCl, 2.16 mM CaCl2, 5.95 mM NaHCO3, 5.55 mM glucose) was started at a rate of 0.06 ml/min using a syringe pump(Harvard Apparatus Ltd, UK). The bladder was cannulated with a stainless steelcannula for urine collection. The cannula was connected to a flexible tube ofthe appropriate size for urine collection. For estimation of urine flow rate,the tube was carefully removed, the urine emptied in a tared Eppendorf tube andweighed.
After a 45–60 mininutes period of stabilization, an infusion containing inulin (fromChicory root, I-2255, Sigma, USA) was started. The perfusion solution contained 36 mg/mL of inulin in Ringer's, andwas infused at a rate of 0.06 mL/min. Primingdose of 160 mg/kg was given intravenously. After a 30 minutes equilibrationperiod, three or four timed samples of urinewere collected (15–20 minutes each). At the midpoint of each urine collectionperiod, an arterial blood sample of 300 μlwas collected in dry heparinzed tubes, and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10minutes. Plasma and urine samples were stored at −70°C for lateranalysis of inulin concentrations.
Concentration of inulin was measured in urine and plasma samples [18] after precipitationwith 10% TCA. Clearance values were expressed in mL/min per 100 g of initialbody weight.
Seven days after STZ or vehicle treatment, rats were anesthetized; the right kidney was removed,weighed, dried, and reweighed. The left kidney was perfusion-fixed with 10%neutral-phosphate buffered formalin. After 15 minutes perfusion, the leftkidney was removed and a 3 mm thick transverse cross-section was cut and placedin formalin. Twenty four hours later sections were embedded in wax, cut into 4micron sections, and mounted on APES (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, Sigma,A-3648) coated slides for morphological studies. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)stain was used for measurements of total glomerular tuft and mesangial matrixareas [19]. The sections were hydrated and then placed in 0.5% periodic acid(5–10 minutes). The slides were washed, successively dehydrated in 70%, 95%,100% ethanol, and 100% xylene, protected with a cover slip using DPX, andallowed to dry overnight. A total of 15 to 20completely round glomeruli showing their tuft attached at the hilum wereselected randomly from all renal cortical zones in each animal. Morphometry of glomeruli was done witha CAS 200 cell analysis system (Becton & Dickinson Image Cytometry Systems,USA). Total glomerular tuft area (GA, mm2) was calculated after manual tracing of each tuft contour. Glomerulartuft volume GTV was estimated fromGTV = b/k×(GA)3/2[20], where b = 1.38is a shape coefficient for a sphere and k = 1.1 a size distributioncoefficient.
Mesangial matrix area in each glomerular tuft was measured using a threshold method thatselectively highlights all PAS-positive areas within the tuft.
All results were expressedas mean ±SEM and were analyzed by one way ANOVA to establish differencesbetween groups. When F was significant, comparisons between any two groups werefurther tested using unpaired two-tailed students t-test for equal orunequal variances according to the equality of variance test. Correlationstudies were done using Pearson's test. The software used was SPSS 11 forWindows. For all statistical tests, a P value of less than 0.05 wasconsidered significant.
Streptozotocin-induceddiabetes caused significant increases in blood glucose concentration, urineflow rate, and PER and a significant decrease in body weight (Table 1).
Seven-daytreatment of diabetic rats with phlorizin reduced the blood glucose levels tonormal values (Table 1) within 60 hours (Figure 1); however, there was stillsignificant diuresis and decrease in body weight (Table 1). Diuresis and body weight loss were alsoobserved in phlorizin-treated control rats (Table 1).
One week of diabetes ledto small (10–12%) but significant (P < .05) increases in the kidney wetand dry weights expressed as percentages of initial body weights (Table 1).Phlorizin treatment prevented the mild renal growth observed in diabetic rats.Phlorizin had no effect on renal wet or dry kidney weights in control rats.
At one-week diabetes, glomerular capillary tuft area andvolume are increased by 9.3% and 14.6%, respectively, with no significant change inPAS-positive mesangial matrix area (Table 2, Figure 2). Phlorizin treatment didnot prevent glomerular growth (Figure 2, Table 2) nor altered mesangial matrix area.However, phlorizin prevented diabetic proteinuria since PER inPLZ-treated diabetic rats was not significantly different from that inPLZ-treated controls. The 1.7 fold higher PER observed in PLZ-treated controlrats compared with untreated controls is consistent with an independent effectof phlorizin on the renal handling of proteins.
Excretion of beta2-microglobulin was measured to assesstubular protein reabsorption [20]. There were no traces of beta2-microglobulinin urine of control, and diabetic rats. However, there were significant amountsof beta2-microglobulin in the urine of phlorizin-treated control anddiabetic rats. Urinary excretions of beta2-microglobulin were 0.018 ± 0.01and 0.023 ± 0.01 mg/24h in PLZ-treated controls and PLZ-treated diabetic rats, respectively (P = 0.7).Thus, while one-week diabetes does not alter the renal handling of beta2-microglobulin,phlorizin has an inhibitory effect on the tubular reabsorption of beta2-microglobulinin control and diabetic rats.
The early 3-4 fold diabetes-associated increase in PERwas not found to correlate with glomerular tuft or mesangial matrix areas orvolumes, but instead was correlated with Cinulin (Figure 3, r2 = 0.6, P < .01), suggesting that is mostly related to functional rather thanto gross morphological glomerular changes.
Mean arterial blood pressure was similar in all thegroups studied (Table 2). One-week diabetic rats had an 80% higher (P < .01)Cinulin than vehicle-treated nondiabetic time controls (Table 2).Phlorizin treatment prevented the diabetes-associated increase in Cinulin.Phlorizin had no significant hemodynamic effect in control rats.
The effects of phlorizin on diabetic-induced changes are summarized in Figure 4. Theseresults show that in diabetes, phlorizin, an inhibitor of proximal tubule sodium-glucosereabsorption, prevents glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria and whole kidney(tubular) growth but not glomerular tuft growth.
One week after induction of streptozotocin diabetes,renal and glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration were observed in Fischerrats. Renal hypertrophy, although small, was significant and occurredindependently of body weight changes. Hyperfiltration was evident by asignificant increase in Cinulin similar to that reported earlier inSD rats [21].
One week of phlorizintreatment prevented renal whole kidney growth and hyperfiltration; however, itdid not prevent glomerular tuft growth. The sustained glomerular growth withphlorizin treatment is probably related to the fact that hyperglycemiapersisted for at least 60 hours after PLZ and STZ treatments. Hyperglycemiainduces the release of growth factors such as VEGF [22, 23], TGF-β [24], andAngiotensin II [25] by resident glomerular cells and by infiltratingmacrophages [26] that invade the glomeruli as early as one day after STZtreatment [26]. Once induced, glomerular growth persists even when glycemia wasnormalized with PLZ for at least three days, which indicates that glomerulargrowth can persist independently of the rates of Na+-glucosecotransport, and of hyperglycemia. Trophic effects of phlorizin per se on theglomerulus have not been reported. Podocytes [27] and glomerular mesangialcells [28] show SGLT 1 expression indicating that Na+-glucosecotransport is active in these cells. Blocking this pathway with phlorizin willreduce glucose entry [28] and decrease their size [29] rather than induce theirgrowth or proliferation.
By contrast, diabetic renal tubular growth, manifested by increases in total wet and drykidney weights [30], was totally prevented by phlorizin treatment. Thisindicates that in STZ diabetes, hypertrophy of renal tubular cells depends onhyperglycemia and the associated increase in tubular Na+-glucosecotransport, and is rapidly reversed by normalizing blood glucose concentration.Thus, diabetic renal tubular and glomerular hypertrophies show differentdynamics upon normalization of blood glucose and probably involve differentgrowth pathways.
The diabetes-associatedincrease in GFR detected in this study is independent of glomerular growth,since with phlorizin treatment GFR was not elevated despite sustainedglomerular growth. Furthermore in diabetes, while the increase in GFR was of80%, that of the glomerular tuft cross-sectional area was only 14%. Since the flowis proportional to the square of the cross-sectional area, most of the increasein GFR was likely due to changes in pre-or postglomerular resistances ratherthan in glomerular cross-sectional area.
Similar to the findings in this study, phlorizin had no hemodynamiceffects in control rats [31]. In control rats, Na+-glucosecotransport represents at most 5% of total Na+ transport in thenephron [31]. However, in diabetic rats, proximal Na+-dependent glucosereabsorption increases [13, 32] with increases in filtered glucose load and in expressionof glucose transporters (GLUT 2) [14, 32]. Enhanced proximal reabsorptiondecreases distal sodium delivery leading to preglomerular dilatation andhyperfiltration through tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) [12]. Acute infusion ofphlorizin, at a dose that does not normalize the blood glucose level, was shownto decrease GFR [13]. Blocking the diabetes-enhanced sodium glucose cotransportwith PLZ decreases expression of GLUT2 [33], greatly decreases proximalreabsorption of sodium, increases its distal delivery, and leads to normalizationin GFR, possibly through reversal of TGF [12]. The effect of phlorizin inpreventing hyperfiltration in the current study was similar to that reportedearlier [13] but occurred with a higher PLZ dose which resulted innormoglycemia and a normal filtered glucose load within 60 hours of PLZtreatment. Therefore, in our experiments, the effect of phlorizin on GFR couldbe direct, due to inhibition of tubular reabsorption of glucose and indirect,through normalization of the blood glucose level and of processes such asenhanced proximal sodium-glucose cotransport that are dependent onhyperglycemia. The prevention of hyperfiltration witheither low or high doses of PLZ suggests that activation of TGF is the mainmechanism by which hyperglycemia increases GFR in diabetes and that its othereffects on renal vessels have little influence on early diabetichyperfiltration.
The reduction in Cinulin with PLZ cannot be accounted for byan effect of PLZ on extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Phlorizin-treateddiabetic rats had twenty-four-hour urine flow rate and diuretic response to Ringer's infusion similar to diabetic rats indicatingsimilar state of hydration in both groups. Therefore, PLZ had no significanteffect on the ECFV of these animals. Phlorizin treatment reduced body weight inboth DPLZ and CPLZ rats, but reduced Cinulin only in DPLZ animals.Thus, the change in body weight associated with PLZ treatment has no directeffect on Cinulin.
Hyperfiltration was correlated with mild proteinuria inthis model of early diabetes. However, since a correlation does not necessarilyindicate a causal relationship, the current data do not allow us to definewhether diabetes leads to mild proteinuria only through hyperfiltration or ifadditional effects are involved. Early diabetic proteinuria was totallyprevented by one week phlorizin treatment indicating that it, as well ashyperfiltration, is due to processes dependent on hyperglycemia and independentof glomerular tuft growth which was not reversed when glycemia was normalizedwith phlorizin treatment. The absence of excretion of beta2-microglobulin,a marker of tubular protein transport [20], observed in diabetic rats indicatesthat there is no early effect of diabetes on tubular protein reabsorption.
In this study we observed persistent glomerular hypertrophy in the absence of proteinuria,hyperfiltration, or whole kidney growth when the glycemia was controlled. Wespeculate that persistent glomerular growth may be a precursor of glomerularsclerosis and of renal insufficiency (low GRF) that occur in the absence ofproteinuria or of kidney hypertrophy in about 20% of patients with diabeticnephropathy [34–36].
This study shows that early in diabetes renal tubular and glomerular hypertrophy, mildproteinuria and hyperfiltration occur in Fischer rats. The data indicate thatthe renal functional changes observed early in diabetes (hyperfiltration andproteinuria) cannot be accounted for by the observed glomerular hypertrophyand, in contrast to glomerular growth, are readily reversed by phlorizin-inducednormalization of blood glucose. Glomerular hypertrophy is an early event in thedevelopment of STZ-diabetes-induced glomerular pathology, occurred in theabsence of mesangial matrix expansion and persisted after short-termnormalization of the glycemia. The alleviation of early renal functional andsome structural (tubule hypertrophy) changes in diabetes with phlorizin, as itdoes in the retina [29], supports its potential therapeutic role in minimizing diabetic microvascular disease. Further studies are needed to investigate ifdiabetes-induced glomerular hypertrophy leads to glomerulosclerosis and how itcan be prevented or reversed.
