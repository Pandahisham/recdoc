Size at birth, weight gain in infancy and childhood, and adult blood                    pressure in 5 low- and middle-income-country cohorts: when does weight gain                        matter?123

Background: Promoting catch-up growth in malnourished children has                    health benefits, but recent evidence suggests that accelerated child weight gain                    increases adult chronic disease risk.
Objective: We aimed to determine how birth weight (BW) and weight                    gain to midchildhood relate to blood pressure (BP) in young adults.
Design: We pooled data from birth cohorts in Brazil, Guatemala,                    India, the Philippines, and South Africa. We used conditional weight (CW), a                    residual of current weight regressed on prior weights, to represent deviations                    from expected weight gain from 0 to 12, 12 to 24, 24 to 48 mo, and 48 mo to                    adulthood. Adult BP and risk of prehypertension or hypertension (P/HTN) were                    modeled before and after adjustment for adult body mass index (BMI) and height.                    Interactions of CWs with small size-for-gestational age (SGA) at birth were                    tested.
Results: Higher CWs were associated with increased BP and odds of                    P/HTN, with coefficients proportional to the contribution of each CW to adult                    BMI. Adjusted for adult height and BMI, no child CW was associated with adult                    BP, but 1 SD of BW was related to a 0.5-mm Hg lower systolic BP and a 9% lower                    odds of P/HTN. BW and CW associations with systolic BP and P/HTN were not                    different between adults born SGA and those with normal BW, but higher CW at 48                    mo was associated with higher diastolic BP in those born SGA.
Conclusions: Greater weight gain at any age relates to elevated                    adult BP, but faster weight gains in infancy and young childhood do not pose a                    higher risk than do gains at other ages.

Stunting and underweight are related to increased morbidity, mortality, and poor                cognitive outcomes during childhood (1–5). The promotion of                compensatory or “catch-up” growth in malnourished children, a                well-established health care practice designed to ameliorate these problems, has                recently been questioned because evidence suggests that rapid weight gain in the                first 2 y of life is associated with an increased risk of being overweight or obese                in later life (6–9). Furthermore, the risk of certain chronic                diseases and related risk factors is increased in individuals who are relatively                small at birth, but relatively large as adults (6, 10–12), which suggests that postnatal weight                gain contributes to the development of disease (13).
The long-term consequences of rapid weight gain in infancy and early childhood in                populations with a high prevalence of early childhood undernutrition are unknown. It                is critical to determine whether any long-term deleterious effects depend on the                timing of rapid weight gain. Evidence from India (14), Guatemala (15), and Brazil                    (16) suggests that timing of weight                gain affects adult body composition, which, in turn, is related to chronic disease                risk. These studies show that faster infant and early childhood weight gain relates                more strongly to adult lean mass than to adiposity, whereas weight gain in later                childhood and adolescence contributes more to adult adiposity.
We used data from 5 low- and middle-income countries to examine how birth weight (BW)                and weight gain into midchildhood relate to blood pressure (BP) in young adults. We                study BP because it tracks into adulthood (17, 18) and is a significant risk                factor for cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to address the following                questions: 1) to what degree are BW and greater than expected                weight gain in early to midchildhood associated with adult BP; 2)                among adults who are the same height and weight, does it matter when a period of                higher than expected weight gain occurred; and 3) does the                association of early childhood weight gain with later BP differ between those who                were born small and those adequate for gestational age (AGA).
We used data from 5 birth cohorts in low- and middle-income countries, united in                    the Consortium on Health Orientated Research in Transitional Societies                    (COHORTS). The 5 cohorts include the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort (19), the Institute of Nutrition of                    Central America and Panama Nutrition Trial Cohort (INTC; Guatemala) (20), the New Delhi Birth Cohort (India)                        (14, 21), the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey                    cohort (CLHNS; Cebu, Philippines) (22,                        23), and the Birth-to-Twenty (Bt20;                    Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa) cohort (24) (Table 1). We refer to these studies subsequently as Pelotas, Guatemala, New                    Delhi, Cebu, and Bt20, respectively. All studies were reviewed and approved by                    an appropriate ethics committee or Institutional Review Board.
Characteristics of the 5 COHORTS (Consortium on Health Orientated                            Research in Transitional Societies) studies1
INTCS, Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama Nutrition                                Trial Cohort; CLHNS, Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey;                                Bt20, Birth-to-Twenty.
We pooled individual data from the 5 cohorts. Our main analysis sample                    (n = 4335) included participants who were not                    pregnant and had height, weight, and BP measured during the most recent                    follow-up and weight measured at 0, 12, and 24 mo and during midchildhood.                    Except for the Bt20 participants, who were adolescents (mean age: 15 y), all                    others were young adults. However, for simplicity, we call these                    “adult” measures. Our analytic method required complete                    child data, so participants missing one or more child weight measures were                    excluded (n = 5266). The large size of the excluded                    group primarily reflected study designs in Pelotas, where 33% of the birth                    cohort was sampled in the first follow-up by selecting infants born between                    January and April, and in Bt20, where a subgroup of those enrolling in the birth                    cohort was sampled at 12 mo of age. For selected analyses, the sample is further                    reduced because of missing gestational age (n = 280)                    or more detailed body-composition data (n =                729).
BP, the main outcome of interest, was measured with an aneroid sphygmomanometer                    in Pelotas, with a mercury sphygmomanometer in Cebu, and with digital devices in                    Guatemala (model UA-767; A&D Medical, San Jose, CA), for the Bt20 (Omron                    M6; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) and in New Delhi (Omron 711). Appropriate cuff sizes                    were used, and the participants were measured while seated after a                    5–10 min rest. For Pelotas, New Delhi and Bt20, we used the mean of 2                    measurements (for Bt20, 3 measurements were taken but the first was discarded).                    For Cebu and Guatemala, 3 measurements were averaged. BP was represented as a                    continuous variable [focus on systolic BP (SBP), but diastolic BP (DBP) also                    reported] or categorized to represent prehypertension and hypertension (P/HTN),                    defined as SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg for adults. Because                    Bt20 participants were adolescents, we defined P/HTN for them as SBP or DBP                    greater than or equal to the 90th percentile of age-, sex-, and height-specific                    cutoffs as recommended by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program                    Working Group (25). Antihypertensive                    medications were used by <0.5% of the participants. We included                    prehypertension in our outcome because of the young age of the study                    participants.
BW was measured by research teams in Pelotas, New Delhi, and Guatemala. In Cebu,                    BW was measured by birth attendants who had been provided with mechanical scales                    for home births (60%) or was obtained from hospital records for the remainder.                    In Bt20, weight was obtained from reliable birth records (26). Subsequent weights were measured by research teams                    using standard techniques (14, 19, 20, 22, 24) and then converted to weight-for-age                    z (WAZ) scores using the WHO Growth Standards (27). The New Delhi weight data                    contributed to the pooled data set as values interpolated to exact ages of 12,                    24, and 48 mo by using individual weight curves. Midchildhood weight was                    measured at a mean age of 48 mo in Pelotas, New Delhi, and Guatemala; at 60 mo                    for Bt20; and at 102 mo in Cebu. To make midchildhood weight comparable across                    sites, we imputed 48-mo z scores for Bt20 and Cebu                    participants, assuming a linear change in z score from 24 to 60                    or 102 mo respectively, and back-transformed the resulting z                    scores into weight (in kg).
Gestational age for most participants was based on a mother's report of                    the date of her last menstrual period and infant birth date. For Cebu                    participants with low BW, or whose mothers had pregnancy complications, Ballard                    scores obtained by clinical assessment were used instead. Small for gestational                    age (SGA) was defined as a BW below the age- and sex-specific 10th percentile of                    the BW distribution published by Williams et al (28).
Body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) was calculated from measured weight                    and height at age 15 y in Bt20 and in young adulthood for the other sites.
Socioeconomic status at birth and in young adulthood was represented by maternal                    education (or paternal occupation in New Delhi) and/or by ownership of various                    household assets. An assets score was created for each site (29), and study participants were                    characterized by quintiles of these scores. Site-specific variables considered                    as potential confounders included race-ethnicity for Pelotas and Bt20,                    urban-rural residence for Cebu, and village of residence for Guatemala (to                    represent village size and nutrition intervention study design).
To eliminate some statistical problems associated with modeling highly correlated                    weight measures, we used conditional weight (CW) variables to represent the                    component of weight at a given age that is uncorrelated with earlier weight                    measures (30, 31). CWs were calculated as the residuals from site- and                    sex-stratified linear regressions of weight (kg) at a given age on BW and any                    prior weights. The regression models also included exact age at measurement, and                    squared prior weight terms to account for nonlinearities. CW is thus the                    deviation in an individual's weight from its expected value, given his                    or her prior weights. CWs are estimated by using an individual's own                    prior weight data, but age- and sex-specific population data are used to                    generate the estimation equation. When a CW variable is included in a multiple                    regression with the variables it is conditioned on (BW and any prior weights),                    it can be interpreted as change in weight over the prior interval.
The CW residuals were standardized to allow comparisons across ages. For                    comparability in analyses that include CW, we also expressed BW as an internal                    sex- and site-specific z score. At 12, 24, and 48 mo, 1 SD of                    CW at the median corresponded to about 1.0, 0.7, and 0.9 kg, respectively, and 1                    SD of BW corresponded to 0.5 kg.
We calculated percentage body fat at follow-up using site-specific methods:                    bioimpedance and estimated percentage body fat with a deuterium-validated                    equation in Pelotas (32); weight,                    height, and abdominal or waist circumferences with an equation validated by                    hydrostatic weighing in Guatemala (33);                    dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic Delphi) for the Bt20; and                    skinfold-thickness equations based on published conversion tables (34) validated for Asian populations                        (35) in Cebu and New Delhi. Fat                    mass (kg) was calculated as percentage body fat × weight, and lean                    mass (kg) was calculated as adult weight minus fat mass.
We first assessed unadjusted differences in mean weight at birth and during                    childhood in groups with and without P/HTN. Differences by P/HTN status,                    stratified by sex and site, were evaluated by t test. We then                    estimated linear (for continuous SBP and DBP) or logistic (for P/HTN) regression                    models. All models included age at follow-up, sex, and site. We found no strong                    evidence of heterogeneity by sex or site. Gestational age, socioeconomic status,                    and site-specific potential confounders were omitted because they were not                    associated with adult BP and did not change the coefficients for the variables                    of primary interest. We developed a series of models. The first included the BW                        z score calculated from the WHO reference and is presented                    for comparison with other studies. The second included a site- and sex-specific                    internal BW z score and CW at 12, 24, and 48 mo, similar to the                    approach used by others (30, 31). We compared models with                    1) no adjustment for adult size, 2) adjustment                    for adult BMI, and 3) adjustment for adult BMI and height.                    Adjustment for adult measures addressed whether higher than expected weight gain                    at specific ages in childhood related to BP or odds of P/HTN among adults with                    the same BMI (or BMI and height). We adjusted for adult height because it is a                    strong predictor of BP in healthy individuals, particularly in adolescents                        (36), and it is highly related to                    lean body mass.
The third set of models included adult CW but not BMI, because adult CW and BMI                    are very highly correlated. These models addressed a different question, namely,                    whether higher than expected weight at any age (including adulthood) related to                    adult BP and odds of P/HTN. To aid in the interpretation of these models (given                    the strong association of BMI with BP), we also estimated a linear regression                    model to determine how each CW predicted adult BMI.
We assessed whether CW related differently to BP or odds of P/HTN in adults who                    were born SGA compared with those born AGA by adding to model 2 a binary                    variable (=1 if born SGA) and terms for the interaction of SGA with                    BW and of SGA with CW at each age. We tested whether the association of                    childhood CW with adult BP differed across the full range of BW by including an                    interaction of BW with each CW.
In a separate analysis, we aimed to isolate possible pathophysiologic effects of                    excess fatness on BP from physiologic variation in BP related to height and lean                    body mass. We first estimated site- and sex-specific residuals of SBP and DBP                    predicted from age, height, and lean mass (representing a deviation from what                    would be expected based on these variables) and then used these residuals as                    outcomes. This analysis could not be conducted for Pelotas females because                    body-composition data were not available for them.
To assess potential selection bias related to the exclusion of the large number                    of Pelotas and Bt20 participants with missing 12-mo weight measures, we created                    a 24-mo CW variable conditional only on BW. We tested whether BW and CW at 24                    and 48 mo had similar associations with adult SBP and risk of P/HTN in our main                    analysis sample (n = 4335) and those excluded only                    because of missing 12-mo data (n = 3842). Results                    were considered to differ if the P value for the interaction of                    being in the analytic sample with BW or CW was <0.10.
Mean age was near 30 y for the Guatemala and New Delhi cohorts, whereas                    participants from Pelotas and Cebu were in their early 20s, and the Bt20                    participants were adolescents. Mean BW was highest in Pelotas and lowest in New                    Delhi (Table 2). WAZ scores varied little by age in Pelotas, whereas Bt20 children                    showed initial catch-up from lower WAZ at birth, but thereafter both cohorts had                    weight gain patterns that parallelled the WHO Growth Standard 50th percentile                        (Figure 1). In contrast, New Delhi, Guatemala, and Cebu children had declining WAZ                    scores in the first year of life. Young adults in Pelotas were the tallest,                    whereas Guatemala and Cebu participants were the shortest. Adult BMI was lowest                    in the Cebu and Bt20 cohorts (the latter likely reflected their young age).                    P/HTN prevalence was higher among males than among females.

The solid lines represent those without prehypertension or                            hypertension (P/HTN), and the dashed lines represent those with P/HTN,                            defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg or a diastolic                            blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg, except for Birth-to-Twenty (Bt20)                            adolescents (defined as a systolic or diastolic blood pressure                            ≥90th percentile of age-, sex-, and height-specific cutoffs;                                25). Sample sizes were as                            follows for those with or without P/HTN, respectively: Pelotas                                (n = 1208 and 279 for males and                                n = 107 and 375 for females), Guatemala                                (n = 27 and 88 for males and                            n = 14 and 86 for females), New Delhi                                (n = 246 and 345 for males and                            n = 103 and 320 for females), Cebu                                (n = 431 and 542 for males and                            n = 99 and 746 for females), and Bt20                                (n = 68 and 100 for males and                            n = 33 and 118 for females).

In all cohorts, WAZ scores tended to be higher in infancy and childhood among                    those who later had P/HTN (Figure 1). By                    48 mo, WAZ scores were significantly higher in those with P/HTN in all cohorts                    except Guatemalan males and New Delhi females. In adults, BMI, on average, was                    2.1 ± 0.14 (SE) units higher in those with P/HTN. Lean and fat mass                    were higher among those with P/HTN in all cohorts, and percentage body fat was                    higher in those with P/HTN in all but Bt20 males (Figure 2). The mean (±SE) age- and site-adjusted difference in fat                    mass in adults with and without P/HTN was 2.81 ± 0.16 kg in males and                    3.85 ± 0.36 kg in females; whereas the mean difference in lean mass                    was 3.67 ± 0.23 kg in males and 2.44 ± 0.23 kg in females.

The upper error bar                            represents the SD of the mean fat mass, and the lower error bar                            represents the SD of the mean lean mass. Numbers in the upper block of                            each column represent percentage body fat (fat mass/total body weight                            × 100 ± SD). Pelotas females were excluded because                            they had missing body-composition data. Sample sizes were as follows for                            those with or without P/HTN, respectively: Pelotas (n                            = 196 and 259 for males), Guatemala (n                            = 26 and 87 for males and n = 14                            and 85 for females), New Delhi (n = 245 and                            344 for males and n = 100 and 318 for                            females), Cebu (n = 411 and 485 for males                            and n = 92 and 638 for females), and                            Birth-to-Twenty (Bt20; n = 65 and 97 for                            males and n = 31 and 113 for females).
BW was not associated with adult SBP, DBP, or odds of P/HTN without adjustment                    for adult size (Table 3 and Table 4; model 1A). After adjustment for BMI (model 1B), BW was inversely                    associated with adult SBP and odds of P/HTN, and the coefficient was larger and                    significant with additional adjustment for adult height (model 1C). BW was                    inversely related to DBP after adjustment for BMI alone (−0.39 mm                    Hg/SD; 95% CI: −0.68, −0.10) or BMI and height                    (−0.46 mm Hg/SD; 95% CI: −0.74, −0.18).

All CWs through midchildhood were strongly associated with adult SBP without                    adjustment for adult BMI or height (Table                    3; model 2A). The 12- and 48-mo CW coefficients were >2 times the                    24-mo CW coefficient. Similarly, higher CWs at 12 and 48 mo were associated with                    an increased odds of P/HTN (Table 4;                    model 2A). After adjustment for adult BMI and height (Table 3; model 2C), BW was inversely associated with SBP,                    whereas the CW measures were unrelated to SBP. Higher BW and CW at 24 mo were                    associated with reduced odds of P/HTN (Table                    4; model 2C). Overall, a 1-SD (≈0.5 kg) increase in BW was                    associated with a 0.5–0.6-mm Hg decrease in SBP and a 9% reduction in                    odds of P/HTN. In a DBP model adjusted for adult BMI and height (comparable with                    that of model 2C in Table 3), BW was                    inversely associated with DBP (−0.51 mm Hg/SD; 95% CI:                    −0.82, −0.21), but CW measures were unrelated to DBP.
In models that included adult CW with or without adjustment for adult height                    (model 3C compared with model 3A in Tables                    3 and 4), BW was unrelated to                    SBP or P/HTN, but all CW variables were strongly and positively associated with                    SBP and P/HTN. Adjustment for adult height (model 3C) increased the coefficients                    for the childhood CW terms. Taller adult stature was related to a lower odds of                    P/HTN in model 3C. The pattern of results for DBP was similar.
BW was more highly correlated with adult height (r =                    0.25) than with adult BMI (r = 0.12), with                    correlations based on site- and sex-specific z scores. CW at                    all ages strongly predicted adult BMI. The sizes of the coefficients relating BW                    and CW to adult SBP in model 3C were roughly proportional to the coefficients                    relating BW and CW to adult BMI (Figure 3).
Coefficients estimated from regressing adult systolic blood pressure (BP;                            solid line) or BMI (dotted line) on birth weight and conditional weight                            at 12, 24, and 48 mo by using data pooled from the 5 birth cohort                            studies (n = 4335).
Modeling the sex- and site-specific SBP residual as the outcome, we omitted age,                    site, and height (because the residual is uncorrelated with these variables by                    definition) but included BW and all CW measures (comparable with model 3A in                        Table 3). The SBP residual was                    inversely related to BW (−0.56 mm Hg/SD; 95% CI: −0.92,                    −0.21); unrelated to CW at 12, 24, and 48 mo; but positively related                    to adult CW (0.65 mm Hg/SD; 95% CI: 0.30, 1.00; P <                    0.01). When added to this model, fat mass was strongly related to the residual                    (0.19 mm Hg per kg fat mass; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.25). Results for the DBP residual                    were very similar for BW (−0.58 mm Hg/SD; 95% CI: −0.88,                    −0.27) and adult CW (0.77 mm Hg/SD; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.07).
To determine whether the association of BW and CW with BP or risk of P/HTN                    differed according to whether an adult was born SGA, we specified model 2C to                    include a main effect of SGA and interactions of SGA with each CW (Table 5). BW was not included in these models because it is highly related to                    SGA. Being born SGA was associated with higher SBP and an increased odds of                    P/HTN, but there were no significant interactions of SGA with CW at any age. For                    DBP, there was no main effect of SGA, but higher CW was associated with higher                    DBP at 48 mo in those who were born SGA. In the alternate analysis designed to                    test whether CW had the same effect across the full BW distribution, no BW by CW                    interaction term was significant for SBP or DBP.

The association of BW and CW with adult SBP and odds of P/HTN was attenuated in                    our analysis sample compared with the sample excluded because of a missing                    weight measurement at 12 mo (Table 6). The BW coefficient was about half as large in the analysis sample, and                    CW at 24 mo and CW at 48 mo estimated without inclusion of weight at 12 mo were                    not significantly related with SBP or of P/HTN in either sample.

Among healthy young adults, body size is the strongest determinant of BP. Thus,                childhood weight gain is expected to predict adult BP to the extent that it                determines adult body size. We wanted to determine how rapid childhood weight gain                at specific age intervals through midchildhood related to adult BP and whether rapid                weight gain was important independent of its contribution to adult size. We used CW                to address these questions because each CW measure is uncorrelated with prior                weight, which allowed for the assessment of the unique contribution of weight at                each age.
In our sample, the associations of BW and CW at 12, 24, and 48 mo with adult BP                roughly reflected the relative contribution of weight gain in these time periods to                adult BMI. For example, children gained about twice as much weight in the first than                in the second year of life. CW at 12 mo had a coefficient ≈2 times that of CW                at 24 mo (Table 3). Adult CW (higher than                expected gain from 48 mo to adulthood) had the largest BP coefficient.
When adult size (indexed by BMI and height) was held constant, there was no interval                through midchildhood when greater than expected weight gain contributed to elevated                BP. However, because models adjusted for adult height and BMI exclude adult CW                (because of the high correlation of these variables), we concluded that weight gain                after midchildhood is an important contributor to risk of elevated BP. This is                consistent with other studies, which showed the importance of heterogeneous growth                trajectories, including a pattern of relative thinness to age 2 y followed by more                rapid growth to age 11 y (12) or excess                weight gain after age 7 y (37). Further                exploration of other weight and height trajectories is planned by the COHORTS group.
Consistent with a large body of research (38, 39) and with our prior                metaregression analysis (29), we found                significant inverse associations of BW with adult SBP and DBP and odds of P/HTN                after adjustment for adult BMI and height. The size of these effects is consistent                with previously published studies (equivalent to 1.1 mm Hg and a 19% reduction in                odds of P/HTN per kg BW) (38, 40).
Concerns have been raised about the interpretation of BW associations in models that                adjust for BMI measured concurrent with the BP outcome. Because of the positive                association of BW with adult BMI and of BMI with BP, negative shifts in the BW                coefficients after adjustment for BMI have been attributed to a bias resulting from                “reversal paradox” (41), and the use of CW does not entirely free us of this concern (42). We opted to present unadjusted and                adjusted results because, without adjustment for adult size, an independent effect                of timing of weight gain cannot be estimated. Adjustment for adult BMI showed a                significant inverse association of BW with adult SBP (models 2C and 3C), which was                strengthened with further adjustment for adult height. This may reflect the higher                correlation of BW with adult height and lean mass than with BMI or fat mass in our                sample. We included adult height in our models because it is an important                determinant of BP in healthy adolescents and was particularly relevant for the Bt20                cohort. Height is also an indicator of lean body mass; thus, adjustment for height                may isolate the adverse effects of adult body fat on BP. It is interesting to note                that in model 3C, which included CW through adulthood, taller stature was associated                with lower odds of P/HTN. Ideally, we would like to have had complete length data                for all of the cohorts, so that we could shed more light on the relative importance                of weight gain and linear growth in childhood.
Given the particular importance in low- and middle-income countries of promoting                early compensatory growth in SGA infants to reduce their risk of morbidity and                mortality and to promote better cognitive outcomes, we tested whether higher CW                related differently to BP in individuals who were SGA. Whereas SGA was related to                higher SBP, the relation of CW to SBP was not different between adults who were born                SGA and those born AGA, nor did this relation differ across the full range of BWs                seen in our samples. Higher CW at 48 mo was associated with higher DBP and odds of                P/HTN in adults who were born SGA. This could have been a chance finding or it may                suggest that midchildhood growth is an important time for development of risk of                elevated DBP in those with a history of prenatal growth restriction.
Several methodologic aspects of our study merit consideration. Integration of data                from 5 cohorts for a pooled data analysis raises concerns about the comparability of                measures across sites and whether the relations of interest vary substantially by                site. Because of the variation in the timing of the midchildhood weight measurement,                we imputed weight at 48 mo for the Bt20 and Cebu cohorts. CW coefficients through                midchildhood were not substantially different when the actual 60-mo and 102-mo                values were used for these sites, so we judged that the benefits of including these                children in the analysis outweighed any potential biases related to imputation. Age                at follow-up differed among the sites. Bt20 participants were adolescents, whereas                the other cohorts included young adults. We addressed this by using a site-specific                definition of P/HTN for Bt20 and adjusted for age in all models. We found no                heterogeneity of effects by site or sex. Alternate models, which included additional                potential confounders, including site-specific variables, produced no notable                differences in the coefficients for BW or CW in childhood compared with our more                parsimonious models. Despite substantial differences in infant and child weight, and                adult age, height, BMI and BP, the similarity across sites of the relations of BW                and CW to adult SBP enhances our confidence that we have identified biologically                meaningful relations.
A final concern was with sample selection bias. Our analysis sample included a subset                of participants with complete growth data in childhood (required to estimate the                full set of CW variables) as well adult anthropometric and BP measurements. It                differs from the full sample of cohort participants owing to attrition typical of                longitudinal studies and to study design (eg, the loss of relatively more                participants from the Pelotas and Bt20 cohorts). Results may be biased if BW and CW                relate differently to adult BP in the included compared with excluded participants.                Whereas it was not possible to estimate the effects of attrition, we used CW                variables estimated without 12-mo data to compare selected models in our analysis                sample to models run with the sample excluded owing to missing 12-mo data. BW                coefficients were significantly smaller in our analysis sample, but CWs at 24 and 48                mo were unrelated to SBP or odds of P/HTN in both samples. The difference in the BW                coefficient was accounted for primarily by the selectivity in the Pelotas sample. It                is possible that seasonality played a role, because the Pelotas participants with                data at 12 mo were those born between January and April.
Investigations of prenatal and early child growth effects on adult BP have been                disproportionately carried out in high-income countries (39) and most have estimated the effects of weight gain                without attention to the high level of correlation among weight measures at                different ages (43–46). An exception to the latter is a recent                study that used a linear spline random-effects model to show that higher weight                gains in the first 5 mo and from 21 mo to 5 y were associated with higher BP (47).
Our study makes a unique contribution to the extant literature with its focus on                samples from 5 low- and middle-income countries. In these settings, where chronic                diseases of adulthood are rapidly emerging as major public health problems, the                possible long-term risks of rapid child growth must be weighed against the                well-established benefits of compensatory weight gain in growth-restricted children                    (4, 5). Evidence from our 5 birth cohorts suggests that higher weight gain in                early life is only associated with elevated adult BP to the degree that early growth                predicts adult BMI. However, at the same level of adult BMI, we found no association                of weight gain from infancy to midchildhood to adult BP or risk of P/HTN.                Furthermore, we confirmed prior studies showing that reduced fetal growth increases                the risk of elevated BP in later life.
Because of its known association with height and BMI, BP may be more strongly                affected by faster weight gain at any age than other chronic diseases and risk                factors. This possibility will be tested by future analyses of the COHORTS data set                addressing outcomes related to body composition, glucose concentrations, and lipid                profiles. We will also look into how early growth might contribute to positive human                capital outcomes, including school attainment and adult height. The evidence thus                far suggests that the positive consequences of faster early weight gain in low- and                middle-income countries outweigh its potential hazards (29). Nonetheless, prevention of overweight and obesity in                children and young adults needs to be a priority to reduce the rising burden of                cardiovascular disease in developing and transitional countries.
