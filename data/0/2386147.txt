A large-scale brain network can be defined as a set of segregated and integratedregions, that is, distant regions that share strong anatomical connectionsand functional interactions. Data-driven investigation of such networks hasrecently received a great deal of attention in blood-oxygen-level-dependent(BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We here review therationale for such an investigation, the methods used, the results obtained,and also discuss some issues that have to be faced for an efficient exploration.

Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) is an imaging technique that makes it possible todynamically and noninvasively track metabolic and hemodynamic changes in thebrain [1, 2]. Theearly developments of BOLD fMRI data analysis have mostly relied on a methodcalled general linear model (GLM), whose objective is to pinpoint the differentialinvolvement of certain regions during various tasks [3–5].Voxel clusters that exhibited such a behavior are declared “activated” andgathered into a so-called activation map that provides the output of the GLMapproach; each map represents all regions that are significantly correlatedwith the stimulus time course. GLM-based methods have been extensively used inorder to extract regions in a wide variety of conditions (see, e.g., [6] for a review of activationstudies related to the premotor cortex).
The GLM,however, does not properly render the brain's intricate organization, which isbelieved to be based on two major principles: segregation and integration [7, 8]. According to thesetwo principles, functional tasks are performed by specific collections of brainregions, also called networks, that are anatomically connected and can engagein complex interactions [9–11]. Even though the BOLD contrast is only remotely relatedto neuronal activity, it was first hypothesized, and then evidenced, that thisimaging modality is able to reflect, at least to some extent, the strongconstraints imposed on the brain by segregation and integration. Thisrealization came from the investigation of the (misleadingly called) “rest”condition. First, studies showed that brain regions could still be correlatedat rest, hinting for the existence of functional brain networks that could stillbe present and imaged even when no task was explicitly required from thesubject [12, 13].Network investigation also started with a closer examination of the“baseline,” that is, the signal measured when a subject is in the “rest” conditionof a protocol, between two task conditions [14]. This approach was justified from the fact that, from anenergetic perspective, the brain uses a significant part of the body's energy,independently of the presence or absence of a “task” [15, 16]. As methods ofincreasing complexity were developed and validated, the objective of manymethodological developments shifted from GLM-related procedures to methods thatwere able to extract networks from BOLD fMRI data.
This paper isan attempt to review the latest advances in investigation of extendedlarge-scale networks in fMRI from a methodological perspective, as well as thenetworks that have been found using these methods. This new methodology, ifconfirmed, has very deep implications in terms of methods that should bedeveloped, and we discuss some of the issues that such methods will have todeal with in order to provide reliable and useful results.
An extended large-scale functional brain network maybe defined as a (potentially large) number of segregated regions (potentiallyspread over the whole brain) that interact in order to execute a coherent task.While Bressler and Tognoli [17] mostly consider“high-level brain functions of which cognition is comprised,” it is importantto emphasize the fact that about any function that the brain is able to processis likely to have a network representation (see, e.g., Section 4 for adescription of some low-level brain functions, such as vision and auditionprocessing).
Large-scalenetworks share many important features. First, they are widely distributed overthe brain. As a consequence of the segregation principle, it is hypothesizedthat they can be broken down into small brain regions, coined “nodes” by Mesulam [18], “units” by Marrelec et al. [19], and “local cortical areanetworks” by Bressler and Tognoli [17], eachregion being characterized by a consistent functional behavior. Such nodes canreadily be identified in subcortical structures, which are often gathered intonuclei [20]. As to the cortex,despite cytoarchitectonic features (embodied, e.g., by the work of   Brodmann [21] and his eponymous regions)that vary across its surface, its parcellation based on structural criteriaalone remains globally a challenge. Nonetheless, local brain areas are alsostrongly characterized by their function [17]. For instance, primary sensory regions (e.g., visual) havebeen localized in a quite reproducible manner; within these regions, areasresponding more specifically to certain types of inputs have been successfullyidentified (e.g., vertical versus horizontal lines in the primary visualcortex [22]). Still, even thoughvarious levels of specialization can usually be observed, there is a generalagreement that most regions cannot be unambiguously associated with onespecific function (see, e.g., [23] for Broca's area) and, in general, a region will exhibit acertain level of “multifunctionality” [17]: its contribution will not be limited to one task but willbe allowed to vary within a given range of functions that it is able toimplement.
As aconsequence of the integration principle, large-scale networks are alsocharacterized by potentially distant regions with strong (anatomical)connections and (functional) interactions. Whether top-down or bottom-up,serial or parallel, connections and interactions are quintessential ofnetworks [18, 24, 25].Anatomically, interregional connectivity is suspected to be rather sparse [26–30]. Even though most connections originating from oneregion are thought to re-enter the same region, axons are known to connectregions that are far apart from each other, for example, homologue regions [e.g., [31–33]]. Functionally, theseconnections have translations at all levels, from electrophysiology [34–38]to measures of the electromagnetic field [39] and of the BOLD signal [12, 13].
Whether coined“new phrenology” [40] orconsidered as being “beyond phrenology” [25], such an approach leads to a model of brain functions inwhich most functional tasks are subserved by functional brain networks, that is,collections of specialized regions that collaborate in order to generate acoherent behavior [11, 36]. In support of this approach, several networkshave already been described and documented. Luria [10] refers to three blocks: one that “regulates the energy leveland tone of the cortex,” another one that is strongly implicated ininformation processing, and a last one that is involved in higher, complextasks, such as “the formation of intentions and programs for behavior.” Mesulam [18] proposed two distinctsubdivisions of the brain. First, based on the co-occurrence of functions withsimilar features, the brain can be divided into five major “subtypes”:primary sensory-motor, unimodal association, heteromodal association,paralimbic, and limbic. There are also at least five large-scale networks, eachdealing with a specific cognitive function: spatial awareness, language,explicit memory/emotion, face-object recognition, and working memory-executivefunction. These networks are not isolated from one another, but interact invery complex fashion, for example, through “transmodal” areas.
Relying on the assumption that BOLD fMRI is indeedable to image brain networks (see, e.g., [15] for a review of the neurophysiological substrate ofneuroimaging), two categories of methods may be identified for such studies:approaches that make use of prior cognitive information and fully exploratorymethods.
Correlational methods were historically the first onesto be applied to investigate large-scale networks in fMRI data analysis, in theform of functional connectivity studies and functional connectivity maps [12, 41–47]. Startingfrom a voxel or region—the so-called “seed” voxel/region—one extracts allvoxels whose time courses are significantly correlated with that of the seed.Measures other than temporal correlation have also been used, such as coherenceand partial coherence [48, 49]. Selection of the seed region is a key issue in studies of functionalconnectivity. First, a brain region is selected according to its function(e.g., cortical representation for hand movement, [47]). The corresponding seed is thenobtained from either prior anatomical knowledge or functional manipulation.Anatomically, common approaches consist of using coordinates in a standardizedspace (Talairach or MNI) [44], orhaving an expert delineate the region on anatomical images [48]. Functionally, the seed can be obtainedfrom an activation map, provided that the region of interest can becharacterized by its implication in a specific task (e.g., the primary motorcortex in a simple movement) [41, 45, 47].
As opposed toeffective connectivity—where Gonçlaves and Hall [50] showed that results of SEM analyses may vary depending onthe choice of the seed voxel—robustness of functional connectivity maps withregard to the selection of the seed region and its spatial extent have barelybeen examined yet. Vincent et al. [51] showedthat, for the visual or the somatomotor network, the resulting functionalconnectivity map was robust to the choice of the starting seed region. Manyother parameters (e.g., design, size of each region) may have an influence onthe outcome of the analysis, potentially leading to different spatialstructures or correlation values between structures. Full exploration of awhole network (i.e., with many regions) would imply the recourse to severalsuccessive computations of functional connectivity maps, each map being used toselect a region significantly correlated as seed voxel for the next step—aprocedure that is lengthy, complex, and whose convergence is not assured. Wang and Xia [52] have recently proposed a methodto perform this exploration in only one step.
The goal of fully exploratory methods is to providedata-driven approaches of large-scale network detection in which no priorcognitive information is required for the methods to proceed. A number of suchprocedures have been proposed, most of them relying more or less closely oneither of the two key features of large-scale networks, namely integration andsegregation.
The vastmajority of approaches proceed as follows. Based on a similarity measure, theygather voxels irrespective of their anatomical proximity (and, hence, ofsegregation) into separate classes that are strongly similar to each other anddissimilar from one another. For each class, the output is a map representativeof the class and an associated time course. All methods have one or severalparameters whose tuning affects the number of classes. Since each class tendsto gather voxels that are strongly correlated, it is often univocallyidentified with a large-scale network. Blind approaches include methods basedon eigenvalue decomposition, such as principal component analysis (PCA) [53–55], correlationclustering [56], Kendall'scoefficient of concordance [57, 58], K-means [59, 60], fuzzy clusteringmethods [54, 56], self-organizing map algorithms [61], Kohonen clustering neuralnetwork and fuzzy C-means [62],hierarchical clustering [60, 63],integration and information-theoretic quantities [64, 65], and spatialindependent component analysis (sICA) [66]. While most methods provide maps that are exclusive (avoxel can only belong to one map), a few (e.g., fuzzy clustering or ICA)provide an index of the plausibility for a voxel to belong to each of thedifferent classes. Most methods also provide local criteria, calling forstepwise analyses, at the exception of PCA and ICA that use global measuresand, consequently, are able to perform classification in one step.
Most approachesmentioned in the previous paragraph have only been used a limited number oftime in fMRI data analysis so far. This can probably be accounted for by thecomplexity of their algorithms, which is commensurate with the difficulty ofthe task at hand. Outstandingly, sICA has been used quite a lot recently, withresults that are rather promising. Regardless of its popularity, though, thenetwork interpretation of the results obtained needs to be proved beyond simplecriteria (these include, e.g., that voxels located close to each other or inhomologue regions tend to belong to the same class). For instance, forPCA, Friston and Büchel [67] mention that theinterpretation of the eigenimages in biological terms might be dubious, sincethey could be rotated in the data space and still be a solution to the problem(but see [68]). By contrast,components obtained through ICA can be more easily related to knownphysiological noises or functional processes [66, 69]. The methodological reasons for this successare, however, still not clear, and many explanations are plausible: therelevance of the assumption of spatial independence, the adequacy of theunderlying mixing model, the efficiency of the global criterion/one-stepdiscrimination approach, or some interesting feature of theinformation-theoretic optimization algorithm. In any case, the fact that itsapplication simplifies the results to a maximum and produces a very limitednumber of widespread networks, making interpretation easier, clearly plays inits favor (compare, e.g., with [70, 71], or [72]). Its sensitivity, whichis much higher than that of clustering methods, might also explain its success.Nevertheless, it must still be kept in mind that the assumptions underlying ICA(perfect synchrony within a network and spatial independence between networks)impose an extreme and unrealistic case of integration. While the simplificationof several time courses into one is performed only once for ICA, the stepwiseprocedures implemented by other methods essentially go through the sameapproximation at each step, leading to an error that is probably far larger.
Unlike thenumerous approaches to functional integration, few methods have specificallysought to extract segregated regions. Some methods decrease the complexity ofthe data by using predefined regions (e.g., according to the Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. [81] template). Approachesusing predefinite regions do not check that all voxels within a region exhibithomogeneous bahaviors; they merely assume that it is the case. Average signalsare then extracted from each region, on which any integration-based approach,such as hierarchical clustering [71, 72], can be applied. Intuitively, manyclustering methods mentioned previously (e.g., K-means, hierarchicalclustering, or information-theoretic measures) could easily be applied for thepurpose of detecting segregated regions by incorporating a constraint ofcontiguity between voxels that could be merged. Among these, only theinformation-theoretic approach explicitly takes both within- andbetween-classes measures of similarity into account. Specifically, they optimizea so-called functional clustering index (FCI) that keeps a balance betweenregion homogeneity (strong segregation) and sparseness of inter-regionalinteractions (low integration) [64, 65]—the latter constraint being hard to justifyfrom a network perspective. As to other clustering methods, as noted by Goutte et al. [60] in accordance to Huygens'formula, maximizing a measure of the internal coherence of a class (associatedwith segregation) is often equivalent to minimizing the same measure ofcoherence but computed between classes (that could be associated withintegration). As such, the behavior of such methods with regard to networkswould again lead to questioning.
A tentativeapproach to consider simultaneously segregation and integration has beenconducted by the large scalenetwork identification (LSNI) method by Bellec et al. [80]. LSNI first clusters neighboring voxelsinto small regions using a region-growing algorithm [82] and then selects regions thatexhibit a significant correlation with other distant regions. Such a procedureallows to define brain functional regions and networks in a purely data-drivenway. While the sensitivity of the algorithm proposed was rather low, it had thegreat advantage to explicitly define and address the two principles offunctional segregation and integration. So far, this method seems adapted forindividual analyses; its extension to group studies seems limited due to thesubject-dependent definition of regions.
During the last decade, several brain systems havebeen studied in fMRI using functional connectivity-related approaches. Thesestudies have revealed integrated systems, including primary systems andassociative networks. Exploratory approaches have also allowed to extractseveral functional networks at once. Even if all brain areas are not includedin a network, these networks involve many areas and constitute a possiblefunctional parcellation of the brain.
The motornetwork was the first network studied through functional connectivityanalyses. Biswal et al. [12] reportedcorrelations in low-frequency resting-state fluctuations between left and rightmotor areas using single-slice fast-sampled acquisitions. This result was laterreproduced with multislice acquisitions where an extended motor network wasshown to correlate with a region in the primary motor cortex [44, 47]. Lowe et al. [44] showed that other functional networkscould be detected using other seed regions, namely the visual network with aseed around the calcarine fissure and a limbic network with a seed in theamygdala. An auditory and a language systems were later extracted in the sameway [41, 43]. Othernetworks were also studied using the seed-region functional connectivityapproach, such as the default-mode network [83–86], the attentionalnetworks [42, 83, 87], and memory networks [46, 88].
Morerecently, a larger number of functional networks were revealed usingexploratory methods based on ICA [76–78]. Even if the number ofextracted networks varied, their spatial organizations were reproducible acrossstudies. For instance, all three studies just mentioned found functionalnetworks involving the same systems that were sometimes split into differentparts (e.g., left/right, rostral/caudal). Using group ICA studies ofresting-state datasets [76–78], which were the most reproducible, we selectedseven functional networks: a motor/sensorimotor system, a visual system, anauditory system, a default-mode network, a dorsal attentional network, aventral attentional network, and an executive control network. Van de ven et al. [75] systematically studied thereproducibility of ICA results on individual datasets and the results usinghierarchical clustering [63] andself-organizing map algorithm (SOM) [61] were presented on an individual level. The results fromstudies that provided a systematic description of all networks found arereported in Table 1. In Figure 1 and Table 2, we also reported results from a study on apopulation of 20 healthy subjects acquired at rest, where networks wereextracted using spatial ICA and a hierarchical clustering approach similar to that of Esposito et al. [79].
Thesensorimotor system involves at least the pre- and postcentral gyri (includingthe primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area). The visual systeminvolves both medial striate and extrastriate regions (calcarine sulcus andlingual gyrus), as well as lateral occipital regions (nonprimary visualregions); these two visual networks (primary and associative) were identifiedseparately by the three group-ICA studies. The auditory system involvesprincipally lateral superior temporal gyri, the Heschl's gyrus and insularcortex. The so-called default-mode network involves the anterior and posteriorcingulate cortices, the medial prefrontal cortex and lateral parietalregions [15, 89–91]. The dorsal attentional network involves lateralprefrontal and dorsal partietal cortex; these regions are involved invisio-spatial control [42, 92, 93]. The ventral attentional network involves inferioroccipito-parietal regions and inferior lateral prefrontal regions; these regionsare principally involved in new item recognition [42, 94]. Last, the executivecontrol network involves superior and middle prefrontal cortices, ventrolateralprefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus [95].
Other studies haveapplied these exploratory approaches to extract integrated functional networksfrom fMRI datasets acquired during external stimulation [73, 79, 80]. The resultsof these three studies are also compiled in Table 1. These results showed thatthe detection  of the functional networks not directly related to thestimulation were less sensitive than that withoutexternal stimulation.
Tracking the presence of extended large-scale networksin BOLD fMRI data raises many issues. We have here focused on some aspectsrelated to the neurocognitive aspects of networks, their identifiability byfMRI, and the methodological questions raised by network analyses.
The major issue to be faced is arguably the verydefinition of an extended large-scale brain network. Indeed, even though thebrain is far from being fully connected, any region is eventually connected toany other regions if one takes polysynaptic connections into account.Obviously, stating that the brain can be considered as one network is by no waysatisfying, no more than it is to say that each macrocolumn forms a networks byitself. The strongly hierarchical nature of the brain's anatomical andstructural organization induces similar characteristics at all levels. As thebrain can be decomposed in networks, each network can in turn be furtherpartitioned into subnetworks, subnetworks into subsubnetworks, and so on.Furthermore, even though there probably is a (potentially loose) relationshipbetween anatomical and functional organizations, it is still unknown howfunctional integration and segregation are coded in anatomical terms. For theexact same structural organization, it has been shown that networks can beobserved to break down as one discriminates different sets of functional tasksor behaviors with increasing precision. For instance, the visual system can bedecomposed into a ventral and a dorsal stream [22]. These two subnetworks, albeit interacting, have very distinctfunctions [42, 92, 96]. Similarly, the motor system can be furtherseparated into a cerebello-cortical and a basal-cortical loop with differentpatterns of involvement [97, 98]. The difficulty to define a network does notyield for primary networks only. For instance, it has been argued that thefronto-parietal network could be further partitioned into two subnetworkssubserving attention and working memory, respectively, [99], while the working memory networkitself could be further broken down in two, with one subnetwork mediatingattentional selection and another one rather underlying language functions [100]. Networks are not exclusive fromeach other either. Mesulam [18] refersto transmodal nodes that connect various neurocognitive networks. For instance,activation of some fronto-parietal regions is observed during differentcognitive tasks [101]; are theseregions transmodal or part of a subnetwork that has a specific function?Similarly, the insular cortex is typically a multimodal association area thatis not specifically activated by auditory stimuli. However, as reported inSection 4, recent papers have consistently classified it as belonging to aso-called auditory system. As evidenced by Figure 1, there are also someoverlapping between networks, and voxels can be simultaneously classified asbelonging to different networks. What is the function of such regions? Couldthis overlapping between networks be related to synchronization through distinctfrequency-bands [35]—if sucha phenomenon is indeed visible through fMRI BOLD imaging? Regarding theinfluence of a task on a network, an issue that has not received much attentionyet, studies have shown that networks could indeed be influenced by theprocessing of a task, either during the task [86] or even after it [102]. It is hence not unrealistic to suspect that processing of atask might also modify the very structure of some networks.
Another cogent question is the relationship between networks as detected by fMRI data analysesand those mentioned in the literature. Networks extracted from fMRI are theconsequence of the optimization of a mathematical criterion whose link toneuroscience is, at the very least, not obvious. While some results have beenrather successfully related to the neurocognitive literature (e.g., attentionalnetwork), other results are more complex to interpret. Some networks extractedseem to share commonalities with some of the subtypes described by Mesulam [18] (e.g., the motor network; cf.Section 2), while others seem to be rather related to  Mesulam [18]'s neurocognitive networks(e.g., the attentional network). Besides, the union of all reported networks(e.g., by sICA) does not include the whole brain. Some brain regions are thenexcluded from the functional networks organization of the brain. Why so?Globally, the criterion used for network extraction might make the methodssensitive to some functions or types of connections. For instance, top-down andbottom-up influences have distinct features [25, 34, 36–38].Can they be detected equally well by existing methods?
Apart fromthese difficulties, there has also been evidence of variability across healthysubjects [80, 103] thatcould be explained by many factors, such as development and/or age [104, 105], and, in general, allforms of plasticity [106, 107]. Pathologies, for example, stroke [108, 109] or tumors [110–113], render the issueeven more complex. Some studies have shown that certain pathologies can havenetwork-specific effects: behavioral deficits in spatial neglects for thefronto-parietal network [114];epilepsy [115] and Alzheimer'sdisease [116] for thedefault-mode network. Nonetheless, these results must be used with caution, forit is not clear yet whether they truly reflect a change in neuronal propertiesor, as, for example, in grade II glioma, a mere modification of the metabolicand vascular properties of the surrounding tissues.
Use of BOLD fMRI as a way to investigate large-scalenetworks relies on three successive assumptions, namely, that informationexchanges between neurons is related to synchronies, synchronies to the BOLDcontrast, and the BOLD contrast to the fMRI data effectively measured.
Synchronies arethe blueprint of communication between regions [17, 39, 117–120] and, as such, should be strongly related to large-scale networks.A challenging issue is to determine the exact relationship between the spatialdistribution and interaction pattern of regions within a large-scale network onthe one hand and, on the other hand, the spatial and frequential distributionof oscillations.
Another issueis the connection between neuronal activity/synchrony and the appearance of aBOLD signal. While much still needs to be unraveled as to the connectionbetween neuronal synchronies and the BOLD signal, it now seems more and moreaccepted that a sustained change in neuronal activity is likely to entail arelative change in the BOLD level [121–124], eventhough the exact relationship is expected to be rather complex [125].
 Still, the BOLDsignal is only a fraction of the total signal that is acquired in fMRI, asignal that is not exempt from many kinds of artifacts [126–128]. Inparticular, some physiological processes (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, ormovement-related) induce spurious effects that contaminate the BOLD signal inthe whole brain [129, 130].Such artifacts are predominant in certain regions of the brain, such as thebasal arteries for cardiac activity or the interfaces between cerebrospinalfluid pools and brain tissus for breathing and head movements. Thisorigin-dependent predilection implies a spatial structure of the noise. Somenetwork detection algorithms may hence recognize voxels influenced by the samespatially structured artifact as meeting the requirement for strong temporalcoherence and, hence, assign them to a common structure. This feature has beensuccessfully used by ICA techniques to provide efficient noise separation andremoval techniques [66, 131, 132]. Yet, the issue arises whenstructures induced by noise are wrongly interpreted as functional networks;their detection and removal is hence of very high importance. The fundamentalquestion, while examining spatial structures with a similar temporal behavior,is “do we measure neurally induced signal or consequences of physiologicalprocesses [133]?” Even though our understanding ofthe potential artifacts that can contaminate the BOLD fMRI signal improves, theconsequences of many potential sources of structured noise have barely beenmentioned, let alone investigated. For instance, it is believed that somemechanisms related to the regulation of blood flow (e.g., through the level ofCO2 in the blood) could inducecoherent changes in BOLD signal throughout the brain—giving birth to aneffect likely to be identified as a functional network. In fact, such an effecthas been used to explain the presence of the default-mode network in fMRI [134, 135]. Now, whether these regionsare wrongfully classified as belonging to a common functional network becausetheir voxels are corrupted by the same artifact, or whether they are actuallyregions that drive the physiological response is a matter that remains to besolved.
Many questions remain open regarding whatmethodologies to apply to extract functional networks. We here quickly discussissues related to the choice of a model, the redundancy of fMRI signals, thenecessity to provide both individual and group analyses, the importance ofresult representation, and the validation of fMRI results with othermodalities.
Procedures usedto investigate networks are usually based on mathematical methods that havebeen discovered independently of the field of fMRI data analysis. Theirbehavior is hence not guided by cognitive but mathematical considerations.While it can be accepted that most methods are general enough to be applied toa wide variety of problems, they still require a careful assessment of how bestto adapt them to the issue at hand. We believe that the major point to copewith here is “how do methods code for segregation and integration? Does it makesense?” A relevant approach could be to try to derive out consistencerequirements from cognitive consideration of what an “ideal” method should beable to do: quantify integration between voxels, regions, or networks using thesame principled measure (such as the multiple correlation coefficient [136] or integration [7, 137]);differentiate between direct and indirect information exchanges (such aspartial correlation [19, 72, 138–141]);discriminate causality from simple co-occurrence (such as Granger causality [138, 142–144]).Some methods are able to deal with one aspect of the problem, but none has beenproposed to answer all these questions simultaneously.
Besides,investigation of large-scale networks face a very interesting problem, namelythat of determining the spatial precision under which data should be consideredas segregated and over which they should be said to be integrated. While it isobvious that neighboring voxels share a great deal of information, methods thatmodel and summarize the behavior of a whole network with one single time courseclearly oversimplify the problem and discard a lot of cogent information. Bellec et al. [80] proposed a statistical modelthat provides a critical distance that separates segregation and integration.Voxel clustering is another attempt to deal with that issue. However, theparameters that characterize the clustering coarseness are set a priori, whenthey should be determined by the intrinsic properties of the data and allowedto vary across the brain (e.g., between subcortical and cortical structures,which have distinct characteristic spatial extents). This step allows one alsoto reduce the dimensionality of the data. At least for this reason, it is acrucial step, because network investigation requires multivariate analyses thatare computationally very demanding (the computational burden roughlyexponentialy increase with the number of regions).
Inneurocomputing, models investigating issues very similar to that of large-scalenetworks have already been developed [145–148]. However, mostmethods developed so far for effective connectivity, such as structuralequation modeling (SEM) [149–152], dynamical causal modeling(DCM) [153–155], or generative models—including neural mass models [145, 156] and large-scaleneural models [147, 157–159]—, have been of little use to theinvestigation of extended large-scale networks, since their intrinsiccomplexity prevent them from modeling systems with that many degrees offreedom (but see, [160]).
Methodsoriginating from graph and/or network theories might prove more adapted to suchproblems [161–163],since they provide global quantification of structures that, besides from beingubiquitous [164, 165],are not unlike some models of brain networks. Using such methods, brainnetworks have been shown to exhibit small-world [70, 166–170] and scale-free [171, 172] features. Thefact that networks simultaneously exhibit both properties has strongstructural [104, 173] andfunctional [174, 175] implications.
Being able todevise methods that can deal with both individual and group analyses is also animportant issue. At the individual level, it is essential to assess thesignificance of the different networks [80, 85, 176]. With procedures of increasingcomplexity, nonparametric resampling procedures [177], mostly used in the context ofthe GLM so far [178], might beappealing [179]. At the group level, one seeks to determine invariant networks acrosssubjects. This has been done by either considering a model for the group [76] or solving the problem at anindividual level and then performing clustering [79]. Validation of such methods haveto be developed; a first step in this direction has been proposed by Calhoun et al. [180].
Once resultshave been produced, representing the results becomes a key issue. Consider forinstance functional connectivity as measured by marginal correlation. Thoughcomputationally tractable on a large-scale network of N units, even for N large, such amethod generates N(N−1)/2 correlationcoefficients (e.g., 4950 for as few as 100 voxels/regions; 19900 for 200; 499 500 for 1000). Simply representing these on a graph as is commonly done [72, 140, 181]would prove impossible to read, let alone to interpret. Procedures thatsummarize the information have to be proposed; these can rely on PCA/MDS [71, 79, 182];they could also use other representational techniques [183, 184].
Last, but notleast, an essential point to validate and better understand the large-scalenetwork approach in fMRI is the comparison with results form other imagingmodalities or areas of neuroscience, such as electrophysiology [34–38], electroencephalography (EEG) ormagnetoencephalography (MEG) [39, 125, 185, 186], and diffusiontensor imaging (DTI) [187–190]. To be able to efficientlycompare results from different imaging modalities, it is essential to betterunderstand how each modality images the activity of large-scale brain networks.In this perspective, providing a unified generative and/or statistical modelfor several of these modalities would be of the utmost importance, grantingaccess to multimodal in vivo imaging of the brain in action.
