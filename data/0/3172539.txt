A STUDY OF SOME SOMATIC TRAITS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA1

Some genetically determined traits, such as ear lobes, finger hair and hairy car were studied in 89 schizophrenic patients and compared with normals. The proportion of schizophrenic males having earlobes hanging free was much less than the control group. This difference is highly significant statistically (p < .0001). Similar was our observation in schizophrenic females (p < .05). Furthermore number of schizophrenic females had finger hair compared to their normal counter parts which was statistically significant. (p <.025).
