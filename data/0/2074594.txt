Improved survival in cervical cancer cases in a rural Indian population.

In the first Rural Cancer Registry in India, 194 cervical cancer cases were registered during 1988-91. The 3 year survival was significantly higher in cases registered in 1990-91 (40.0%), than in those registered in the earlier years (26.6%). This improvement was due to the cancer education activities undertaken by the Registry.
