Ethyl­enedi­ammonium sodium tetra­kis­[bis­(ethyl­enedi­amine-κ2N,N′)(oxalato-κ2O1,O2)cobalt(III)] [penta­hydrogen di(phosphato­octa­deca­tungstate)] tetra­deca­hydrate

The title compound, Na(C2H10N2)[Co(C2O4)(C2H8N2)2]4[H5(P2W18O62)2]·14H2O, prepared under hydro­thermal conditions, consists of two Dawson-type [P2W18O62]6− anions, four isolated [Co(en)2(ox)]+ cations (en = ethyl­enedi­amine and ox = oxalate), one Na+ cation, one [H2en]2+ cation, and a number of ordered (14) and disordered solvent water mol­ecules. The [P2W18O62]6− polyoxidometalate anion has site symmetry 1 and contains two structurally distinct types of W atoms: viz. six W atoms on vertical pseudo-mirror planes grouped in two sets of three, and 12 equatorial W atoms that do not lie in the pseudo-mirror planes grouped in two sets of six. In each [Co(en)2(ox)]+ cation, the CoIII ion is coordinated by four N atoms from two en ligands and two O atoms from the ox ligands, completing a distorted octa­hedral structure. The sodium cation lies on an inversion centre and additionally links the complex cations and anions. In the crystal, the various units are linked by N—H⋯O and O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, which together with C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds form a three-dimensional structure. The contribution of a region of disordered electron density, possibly highly disordered solvent water mol­ecules, to the scattering was removed with the SQUEEZE option of PLATON [Spek (2009 ▶). Acta Cryst. D65, 148–155]. To equilibrate the charges five H+ ions have been added to the polyoxidometalate. These H+ ions and the disordered solvent contribution were not included in the reported mol­ecular weight and density.
