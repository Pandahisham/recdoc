A PSYCHOSOCIAL STUDY OF DELUSIONAL PARASITOSIS

Forty eight patients of delusional parasitosis seen during a short span of five years were studied and underlying psychosocial factors were analysed. The findings revealed that elderly, married, and illiterate persons of rural area from lower socio-economic stratum were distinctly more affected. The incidence of the disease was greater during the months of May to August. Majority of them had abnormal personality traits and definite psychiatric illness was present in about one third of the patients. The psychosocial factors associated with the disorders are discussed.
