RISPERIDONE INDUCED TARDIVE DYSKINESIA - A CASE REPORT

Risperidone is a serotonin - dopamine antagonist which has got less propensity to cause tardive dyskinesia than conventional antipsychotics. There have been few reports of tardive dyskinesia induced by risperidone. This is a report of a case of risperidone induced tardive dyskinesia. A 56 year old female with a 6 months history of paranoid schizophrenia, developed bucco-oro-masticatory abnormal involuntary movements after receiving risperidone 8 mg/day for about 1 year. She had some of the risk factors for the development of tardive dyskinesia like age, sex, anti-chotinergic drugs and earlier emergence of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of the patients developing tardive dyskinesia when they are given the supposedly safe neuroleptic risperidone.
