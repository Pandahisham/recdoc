PARAMNESTIC DELUSIONS FOLLOWING HEAD INJURY

Paramnesic delusions are rare psychiatric sequelae after head injury. In a follow-up of 346 patients only three such cases were seen. Case histories of those patients with a follow-up for eighteen months, their clinical features, psychometric evaluations etc. are described, followed by a discussion into their genesis and persistence.
