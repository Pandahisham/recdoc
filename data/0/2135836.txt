KINETIC STUDIES ON IMMUNE HEMOLYSIS 

 A quantitative method for the study of the kinetics of immune hemolysis is described. In the presence of excess C' and limited amounts of antibody the kinetics of hemolysis resemble those of enzymatic processes. Assays of hemolytic antibody should therefore be based on velocity measurements rather than end point titrations.
