Subject. We present the case history of a 47-year-old lady who,            10 months following excision of a soft tissue sarcoma from the left thigh, was struck with            recurrent episodes of foot drop.
Discussion. The curious phenomenon of recurrent foot drop was found            to be secondary to pressure symptoms from a tense seroma of the thigh. She underwent            surgical excision of the sac and had immediate and complete relief of symptoms.
