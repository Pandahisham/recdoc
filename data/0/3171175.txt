Development and evaluation of a medication counseling workshop for                    physicians: can we improve on ‘take two pills and call me in the                    morning’?

Physicians often do not provide adequate medication counseling.
To develop and evaluate an educational program to improve physicians’                        assessment of adherence and their medication counseling skills, with                        attention to health literacy.
We compared internal medicine residents’ confidence and counseling                        behaviors, measured by self-report at baseline and one month after                        participation in a two-hour interactive workshop.
Fifty-four residents participated; 35 (65%) completed the follow-up survey.                        One month after training, residents reported improved confidence in                        assessing and counseling patients (p<0.001),                        including those with low health literacy (p<0.001).                        Residents also reported more frequent use of desirable behaviors, such as                        assessing patients’ medication understanding and adherence barriers                            (p<0.05 for each), addressing costs when                        prescribing (p<0.01), suggesting adherence aids                            (p<0.01), and confirming patient understanding                        with teach-back (p<0.05).
A medication counseling workshop significantly improved residents’                        self-reported confidence and behaviors regarding medication counseling one                        month later.

Approximately 50% of patients do not take medications as prescribed (1, 2). This can lead to poor control of chronic diseases and worse health outcomes,            including higher mortality (3, 4). Patients with low health literacy are at            particular risk of misunderstanding medication instructions (5, 6), and this lack            of understanding may be associated with worse medication adherence (7, 8).
Physicians often are not fully aware of patients’ non-adherence, in part because            they do not adequately assess patients’ medication use during routine office            visits (9, 10). Physicians also commonly fail to provide appropriate            counseling about prescription medications (11–14). For example, when            prescribing a new medication, physicians often do not discuss the medication's            name (missing 26% of the time), purpose (13%), dosing instructions (42–45%),            potential adverse effects (65%), or cost (88%) (15, 16). In both inpatient and            outpatient settings, patients rate physicians’ consideration of their desire and            ability to comply with treatment recommendations lower than other aspects of            physician-patient communication (17, 18).
Educational programs are needed to improve physicians’ assessment of medication            use and their patient counseling skills (9).            Such programs should address the intersection of health literacy and medication use,            especially in clinical settings where low health literacy is prevalent (6, 19). Here we describe the development and evaluation of a workshop for            physicians to improve skills in medication counseling, with an emphasis on the needs of            patients with low health literacy. The objective of the present evaluation is to assess            the effect of this focused educational intervention on physicians’ confidence and            behaviors with regard to counseling patients about prescription medications.
The study was conducted among internal medicine residents at Emory University                    School of Medicine. The residents’ continuity clinics are located in the                    Primary Care Center of Grady Memorial Hospital, where inadequate health literacy                    affects more than one-third of all patients and 80% of those over age 60 (19). In previous research, 47% of                    clinic patients were unable to understand directions for taking medicine on an                    empty stomach, and 44% could not understand how to take a medication every six                    hours (20). A patient education needs                    assessment indicated that medication adherence was the most important                    educational issue for patients in the clinics (21).
All residents (postgraduate years (PGY) 1, 2, and 3) assigned to their ambulatory                    medicine rotation from March to December 2007 were eligible. During this                    rotation, residents have one half-day per week blocked for educational                    workshops. The medication counseling workshop was part of this required series.                    Attendance at educational conferences was expected of all residents who did not                    have a schedule conflict (e.g., vacation or having just taken overnight call).                    Participation in the research study was voluntary and did not affect                    residents’ standing in the program. Participants provided informed                    consent. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards                    of Emory and Vanderbilt Universities.
We followed an established six-step method for curriculum development: problem                    identification and general needs assessment; needs assessment of targeted                    learners; goals and objectives; educational strategies; implementation; and                    evaluation and feedback (22). The                    workshop content was devised from a literature review and other educational                    materials on clear health communication, medication adherence, and patient                    counseling (23–28). An overview of workshop content is                    shown in Table 1. A version of the                    workshop slides, adapted for clinical pharmacists, is available online (29).
 Medication counseling workshop content
The two-hour workshop was taught by the lead author, using didactic but primarily                    interactive techniques to engage participants fully, meet their individual                    needs, and maximize behavior change (30, 31). Participants                    discussed their perceptions of and previous experiences with non-adherent                    patients, including communication difficulties related to low health literacy.                    Small group breakout sessions allowed participants to practice the teach-back                    technique and adherence-building strategies, using scripted scenarios and role                    play (32). In these breakout                    sessions, participants worked in groups of three, with one serving as the                    patient, one as the physician, and the third as an observer who provided                    feedback.
The instruments for this study were developed from existing questionnaires                    located through a literature review (11, 33, 34). New items of a comparable format                    were added. Variables assessed in the baseline and follow-up questionnaires                    included demographics (age, gender, race, year of training); previous training                    in medication counseling (baseline only); knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes                    about physician medication counseling; confidence in performing medication                    counseling; and self-reported medication counseling behaviors. The knowledge,                    beliefs, and attitudes scale had poor internal consistency reliability at                    baseline (Cronbach's α=0.002), and its results are not reported                    here.
The confidence scale comprised seven items with Likert response choices ranging                    from 1 (‘not confident’) to 4 (‘very confident’).                    Specifically, participants were asked to rate their confidence in their ability                    to describe effectively the scope of medication non-adherence, discuss its                    health effects, describe factors that may contribute to non-adherence, discuss                    the role of health literacy in medication use, assess patients’                    medication adherence, counsel patients about medication use, and counsel                    low-literacy patients about medication use. The items demonstrated good internal                    consistency reliability at baseline (Cronbach's α=0.77).
To assess self-reported medication counseling behaviors, participants indicated                    the frequency with which they performed 24 behaviors on a Likert scale that                    ranged from 1 (‘never’) to 5 (‘all of the time’).                    Examples of desirable counseling behaviors included assessing patients’                    adherence and their understanding of how to take their medications, asking                    patients about their barriers to adherence, helping patients develop a plan to                    overcome their own barriers, asking patients about the cost of their                    medications, considering cost when prescribing, discussing potential                    side-effects and their management, demonstrating how to perform skills (e.g.,                    inhaler use), avoiding jargon, and using teach-back. The behavioral items                    demonstrated good internal consistency reliability at baseline                    (Cronbach's α=0.80).
The initial questionnaire was administered in person during the workshop.                    Follow-up questionnaires were administered through an internet-based application                    approximately one month later. Each questionnaire took about five to eight                    minutes to complete. Responses to both questionnaires were confidential. Upon                    completion of the second survey, subjects were asked to e-mail or call an                    administrative assistant, who was not a member of the research team, to receive                    a $10 gift card. This allowed us to distinguish who had participated without                    associating responses with individual participants or being able to link                    pre-test and post-test responses.
The sample size was determined by the number of available residents, rather than                    by statistical calculations. The primary outcome was self-reported medication                    counseling behaviors. The secondary outcome was self-reported confidence in the                    ability to provide medication counseling. Scores on each of these scales were                    computed by adding individual item scores and dividing by the number of valid                    responses, so the confidence scale score ranged from 1 to 4 and behavioral scale                    score ranged from1 to 5. Higher scores indicated greater confidence in                    medication counseling and more frequent use of recommended medication counseling                    behaviors, respectively.
We first established pre-test and post-test group equivalence on each demographic                    characteristic using chi-square tests for categorical variables and                        t-tests for continuous variables. A single chi-square test                    examined prior medication counseling training (none/a little bit=1 and a                    moderate amount/a lot=2) by year in residency (PGY1=1, PGY2=2, PGY3=3).
We used independent samples t-tests to assess change in the                    scales for confidence and medication counseling behaviors, comparing pre-test                    and post-test responses. We examined the magnitude of the pre- to post-test                    group mean difference in confidence and behavior by calculating Cohen's                        d. This effect size classification that has since become                    convention exhibits the following values: small effect                        d=0.20, medium effect                    d=0.50, and large effect                    d=0.80 (35).
A series of Mann Whitney U tests was also performed to examine pre/post change on                    individual items pertaining to confidence and behaviors. One-way ANOVAs examined                    residency year differences in confidence and behaviors at pre-test and                    post-test. We used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons.                    All analyses were performed in SPSS version 19.0 for Windows. A two-sided                        p-value <0.05 was considered statistically                    significant.
Out of approximately 60 residents who attended one of the medication counseling                workshops, 54 enrolled in the study and completed the baseline pre-survey.                Thirty-five residents (65%) also completed the post-survey. At pre-test,                approximately 46% of the participants were female, 57% were white, and most were in                their first year of residency (69%; see Table                    2). The pre-test and post-test groups did not differ significantly in                demographic characteristics (Table 2).                According to a single chi-square test, at pre-test PGY1 participants were more                likely than PGY2 and PGY3 participants to report they had none/a little bit of prior                training in medication counseling, χ2 (2)=2.7,                p=0.03.
Characteristics of resident physicians at pre-test (n=54) and post-test                        (n=35)
Note: Unless noted otherwise, values are presented as N                            (%). Pre/post-test group equivalence was established with chi-square                            tests for categorical variables and t-tests for                            continuous variables (age).
At baseline, participants’ confidence in performing medication adherence                counseling was relatively poor, with a mean (SD) of 2.52 (0.66) out of a possible                4.00 on the confidence scale. After training, confidence increased significantly                (post-test mean=3.20, SD=0.34), p<0.001 (Fig. 1). The effect size was large                (Cohen's d=−1.38). Responses on each item from the                confidence scale improved significantly from pre-test to post-test                    (p<0.001 for each), including participants’                confidence in counseling low-literacy patients.
Mean change in medication counseling confidence and behaviors.
Values represent mean (SD).
Residents’ self-reported medication counseling behaviors also improved, though                less consistently across items. Overall, the mean (SD) for the behaviors scale rose                from 2.79 (0.36) at pre-test to 3.23 (0.63) at post-test, out of a possible 5.00,                    p<0.001 (Fig.                1). Again, the effect size was large (Cohen's                d=−0.90).
Participants reported using a number of desirable behaviors after attending the                workshop. They more frequently reported assessing patients’ understanding of                how to take their medications, as well as barriers to adherence                (p<0.05 for each). After the workshop, participants were                more likely to ask patients about medication costs (p<0.01),                look up prices (p<0.05), and consider patients’                out-of-pocket costs when prescribing (p<0.01). They were                also more likely to tailor the regimen to the patient's lifestyle to enhance                adherence (p<0.01). Residents more frequently reported                engaging patients about medication use (e.g., eliciting their feelings about                following the treatment plan and encouraging the use of reminders,                    p<0.01 for each). After the training, residents also                reported greater use of recall-promoting strategies, such as having patients                teach-back key instructions, p<0.05.
Participants’ self-reported behaviors did not change in several other areas,                including trying to be non-judgmental when a patient admits non-adherence; asking                patients whether they are experiencing side-effects from their medications;                discussing potential side-effects; enlisting the support of a patient's                friend or family to help with adherence; or use of simple, non-medical language when                discussing medications. Participants reported high scores on the latter at pre- and                post-test, suggesting a ceiling effect.
One-way ANOVA models revealed no significant differences on the confidence and                behavior scales by residency year at pre-test and post-test.
Physician-patient counseling about medications has the potential to improve                patients’ understanding of and adherence to their medication regimen (9, 26). This study evaluated the effect of an educational training program                designed to improve resident physicians’ assessment of medication use and                their adherence counseling skills. We found that a medication counseling workshop                significantly improved residents’ confidence to perform adherence counseling,                awareness of medication costs, and self-reported counseling behaviors at one                month.
At baseline, physicians’ confidence to counsel patients about medication use                was relatively low. This finding is congruent with the results of an investigation                by Russell and colleagues (12), which                found relatively low medication assessment and counseling skills (compared to other                patient-provider communication skills) among a multidisciplinary group of physicians                and clinic staff. Interestingly, Golin and colleagues found that physicians’                perceived skill in medication counseling correlated with their likelihood of                providing such counseling (11).
Tarn and others have examined how often physicians counsel patients about various                aspects of medication use (11–16). Such                discussions occur infrequently overall, though they appear more common for newly                prescribed or changed therapies (11,                    13). We are encouraged by the results                of this study, which showed that a single medication counseling workshop                significantly increased the self-reported performance of numerous medication                counseling behaviors. Importantly, many of these behaviors addressed aspects of                health literacy, such as assessing patients’ understanding of how to take                their medications, suggesting reminder strategies (e.g., pill boxes, medication                calendars), demonstrating use (e.g., inhaler technique), and employing teach-back to                confirm patient comprehension. Increasingly, low health literacy is recognized as a                barrier to safe and effective medication use (36, 37). Others have shown                that physicians feel ill-equipped to address the health-literacy-related needs of                their patients (38). Thus an increase in                these specific medication counseling behaviors, along with a significant increase in                residents’ confidence to counsel low-literacy patients about medication use,                is particularly encouraging and important.
Another noteworthy area of improvement relates to addressing the cost of medications.                Concerns about the high cost of prescription medications and the effect of costs on                adherence have garnered much attention (39–44). Alexander and                colleagues noted that research is needed to assess the effect of communication about                costs on patient satisfaction, utilization, and outcomes (40). While it was outside the scope of this study to assess                patient outcomes, we did observe an increase in awareness of medication costs, as                well as an increase in residents asking patients about costs and considering                patients’ out-of-pocket costs when prescribing. Subsequent studies could                assess the effect of increased awareness and discussion of costs on patients’                expenses and adherence.
In addition to improvements in counseling related to health literacy and cost, we                observed an increase in counseling behaviors pertinent to providing patient-centered                care. These included asking patients about barriers to adherence and tailoring the                regimen to the patient's daily lifestyle. Residents also more often reported                eliciting patients’ feelings about their ability to follow the treatment                regimen, an area which in prior research has been rated by patients as lacking                    (17, 18).
Before the workshop, PGY1 residents were more likely to report that they had received                no or little prior training in medication counseling. However, we observed no                consistent differences in residents’ confidence and behaviors at pre-test or                post-test, suggesting that an educational model such as this could be valuable for                residents in all years of training.
This study has several limitations which should be acknowledged. First, it took place                at a single institution, which may limit its generalizability. Second, due to the                nature of the consent and data collection processes, which were designed to protect                the confidentiality of the participating residents, the comparisons presented here                are at the group level (pre versus post), rather than paired at the individual                level. Third, while the majority of workshop participants completed a follow-up                survey, others did not. Non-responders may have had less interest in the subject                matter or perceived less of a change in their confidence or behaviors. Fourth,                because of the resources available, we relied on residents’ self-assessments,                rather than direct observation of their counseling behaviors. The measures utilized                are subject to social desirability bias, and their validity and reliability are                still being established. Fifth, we did not assess whether the benefits of this                intervention persisted beyond one month; this should be the subject of future                research.
Through a relatively brief training intervention, it is feasible to improve                residents’ confidence in counseling patients about medication adherence,                including those with low health literacy. Residents who attended this program also                reported a significant increase in their use of desirable counseling behaviors one                month after the intervention.
Educational initiatives to improve physicians’ medication counseling skills                should be disseminated more widely. Indeed, the program described here was adapted                to train pharmacists on how better to counsel patients with low health literacy                    (29), and it has been incorporated                into the training of pharmacists who provided medication counseling in two                controlled trials (45, 46). In doing so, we have tailored the                program's scope and length according to the audience and available teaching                time. Additional studies are needed to assess the effect of such training on patient                medication adherence and clinical outcomes.
