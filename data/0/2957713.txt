GENDER DIFFERENCE IN RESOLUTION OF MANIA

Gender differences are being increasingly reported across psychiatric disorders. Females are known to be more at risk for developing unipolar depressive disorders. In bipolar disorder there is more dysphoria, rapid cycling and more number of depressive episodes in females. However studies on gender difference in resolution are scarce. This study was conducted in Central Institute of Psychiatry to assess the gender difference in resolution of mania. 24 males and 16 females were rated at day 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 & 28 on scale for Manic States, ft was found that males settled faster than females, which was evident at day 14. The rate of resolution was more in males in the first week. Remission was also reached earlier by males.
