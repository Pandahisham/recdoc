Background. With the world becoming a global village, tuberculosis is no longer limited to endemic areas. Our case emphasizes the impact of immigration on infectious disease epidemiology and challenges associated with diagnosis and treatment in pregnancy. Case. A 21-year-old Hispanic female presented in preterm labor and was found to be hypoxic. Chest X-ray revealed a paratracheal mass which a CT scan confirmed. PPD test was positive. Bronchoalveolar lavage did not reveal acid-fast bacilli and biopsy revealed caseating granulomas. Diagnosis and treatment were challenging due to constraints in radiological investigations, lack of initial evidence of acid-fast bacilli, and toxic profile of medications. Due to her high risk, she was started on antituberculosis regimen. The diagnosis was confirmed on Day 26 when Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated by DNA probe. Conclusion. A high index of suspicion is required to recognize the changing face and disease spectrum of tuberculosis and initiate treatment for better outcomes.

The phenomenon ofimmigration has an immense impact on the health care of population in the United States. Cases of tuberculosis (TB) among foreign-born nationals, currently living inthe United States, account for more than half of the total. Recognition of this fact helps in earlydetection. Atypical presentation may lead to misdiagnosis or a delay indiagnosis. Also the absence of systemic symptoms does not rule out TB.Radiological imaging, sputum smear, and PPD only aid in the diagnosis but ahigh degree of suspicion is required to ascertain an accurate diagnosis.Establishing an early diagnosis of TB infection and disease in a pregnant womanis important as it affects the health of both mother and infant [1].
A 21-year-old Hispanic female with a 32-week twin pregnancy presented inpreterm labor. She had immigrated to the United States  two years prior, andher pregnancy course was uncomplicated except for complaints of an occasionalnonproductive cough. She was a nonsmoker, denied any history of TB exposure,and was HBsAg and HIV negative. On general exam, she was tachypneic and anxiousbut in no apparent respiratory distress. She was found to have a low oxygensaturation of 89% on room air with a respiratory rate of 30/min and her bloodpressure was 127/76 mmHg. Lung exam was clear to auscultation. Her uterinefundal height corresponded to 32-week twin pregnancy and she had bilateralpedal edema. She was also noted to have uterine contractions every 1–3 minutes.
She was initially admitted to the labor and delivery unit in our hospital andsubsequently transferred to the medical ICU. ABG showed pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of29, PaO2 of 64, bicarbonate of 18, and the base excess of −6, saturating at 93%on 21% FiO2. CBC showed WBC 9.9 th/mm3, Hb, and Hct 10.8 g/dl and 32.8%,respectively, Platelets 432 th/mm3. The chest X-ray demonstrated a rightparatracheal soft tissue opacity measuring approximately 4 × 4 cm with a slightelevation of the right hemidiaphragm with a linear density in the right lowerlung consistent with atelectasis (see Figure 1). No prior X-ray was available for comparison.Patient was put in respiratory isolation early on and the pulmonary team wasconsulted. CT showed a large extensive mediastinal soft tissue mass in theright paratracheal region extending into the hilar and subcarinal region. Anassociated atelectasis on the right upper and lower lobe with questionablealveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe was also found. An abdominalultrasound showed twin-twin transfusion with reversed end-diastolic flow onumbilical artery doppler in twin B and the patient had an emergent lowtransverse cesarean section the next day with delivery of two male infants.Infant A had Apgars of 7 and 9, and infant B had Apgars of 0, 4, and 5,respectively. Both infants went to the NICU, and the patient returned to theMICU.
A PPD was placed which was positive at 10 mm after 72 hours. Successfulsamples of sputum could not be obtained but a bronchoscopy with endobronchialbiopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done. Bronchoscopy showed a tracheawith diffuse mucosalswelling and the mucosal abnormalities persisted throughout the right bronchialtree. She also had irregular tumor growth from the anterior wall of theproximal bronchus intermedius and the base of the proximal right upper lobebronchus. These two growths were sampled and the infectious disease team wasconsulted. There was an abundant growth of Staphylococcus aureus but no acid-fast bacilli (AFB), fungus,or hyphae from the BAL. The patient was started on Vancomycin and Clindamycinto cover Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which was later changed to Moxifloxacin based onsensitivities. Transbronchial biopsy of the right bronchus intermedius showedinflammatory and squamous debris with ulceration, reactive squamous epithelium,and colonizing coccal bacteria. Endobronchial biopsy of the proximal bronchuswall showed caseating granulomatous inflammation.
The treatment of this young Hispanic immigrantfemale with an occasional cough, positive PPD, questionable alveolarinfiltrate, caseating granulomatous inflammation and no significant evidence ofTB infection posed a definite challenge. Given her high risk for TB, she wasempirically started on INH, Rifampin, Ethambutol, and Pyrazinamide. It was onlyon Day 26 that Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated by DNA probe from her right lung tissue which was subsequentlyconfirmed on culture. The infants were started on INH prophylaxis afterplacental pathology did not demonstrate evidence of TB. Patient was dischargedto home in a stable condition to be followed up at the local TB center fordirect observation therapy.
Among the communicable diseases, TB is the second leading cause of deathworldwide, killing nearly 2 million people each year [2]. The World HealthOrganization estimates that 2 billion people have latent TB, in addition to the3 million people worldwide who die each year due to TB. After a resurgence ofTB in the United States  between 1985–1992, the declinenoticed during 1993–2005 has sloweddown causing concerns that the progress achieved in eliminating TB is slowingdown [3]. Immigration demographics demonstrate that Asians, blacks, andHispanics essentially bear the burden of TB in immigrants [3]. The number of TBcases due to foreign-born individuals has increased each year since 1993. In1996, 10% of the 20,973 US TB cases were among foreign-born Hispanic persons,with the four states bordering Mexico  accounting for 83% of foreign-born Hispanic cases. Mexicans accounted for 22.9%of foreign-born patients or 8.4% of all US cases and persons born in Central America comprised an additional 4.7% of foreign-bornpatients or 1.7% of all US cases. Guatemala and El Salvador contributed to nearly 75% of thesecases and the remaining were from the rest of Central America [4]. In 2005, whencompared between foreign-born persons in the United States  and US-born persons,the TB rates were 8.7 times higher inimmigrants; with Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians having TB rates 7.3, 8.3, and19.6 times higher, respectively, than those of whites [3].
M. tuberculosis is transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei, which maycontain fewer than 10 bacilli and humans are the only known reservoir for M.tuberculosis [5]. Individuals at high risk for M. tuberculosis infection in industrialized countries include (i) individuals likely to beexposed to or become infected with M. tuberculosis: close contacts of apatient with infectious TB, foreign-born individuals from high-incidence areas,the elderly, residents of long-term care facilities (e.g., correctionalfacilities and nursing homes), IV drugs abusers, other groups identifiedlocally as having increased prevalence of TB (e.g., migrant farm workers orhomeless persons), and individuals who may have occupational exposure to TB; and(ii) individuals at high risk of developing TB disease once infected: individualsrecently infected with M. tuberculosis (within the past 2 years),HIV-infected individuals, individuals with immunosuppressing conditions ormedication use, individuals with a history of inadequately treated TB, andinfants. Chances that an individual acquires infection depend on theinfectiousness of the index case, duration of the exposure, environment(crowding, poor ventilation), and virulence of the organism.
Atypical presentations and slow confirmation by culture often delay thediagnosis and treatment of patients with TB. Other reasons include an under useof tuberculin skin tests, misinterpretation of unusual chest X-rays, andwaiting for culture results in patients with AFB-negative smears [6].
Chest radiography is often reliable and an important investigation. Generally,in TB, a segmental pneumonic process is seen but may be too small to visualizeradiographically or complicated by atelectasis from the raised diaphragmcompressing the lower lung fields in pregnancy [7, 8]. Upper zone shadowing,often bilateral and likely associated with cavitation or miliary shadowing arethe classic findings. New findings like softshadowing amongst old, fibrotic changes generally indicate a relapse.Paratracheal, mediastinal, and hilar lymphadenopathy, though not unusual inAfrican and Indian patients with TB or in children, are generally unusual inimmunocompetent adults like ours. In patients infected with HIV, theradiological appearances could often be nonspecific [9].
In our patient, the situation was complicated by a right lower lobe infiltrate.The infiltrate could have been misdiagnosed as atelectasis in a woman with a 32-weektwin pregnancy. Tuberculin skin test in our patient was read as 10 mm. Fivemillimeters is considered to be positive in individuals with HIV, on steroidtherapy, or in individuals in close contact with a person with active TB. Ourpatient denied any contact with TB. Larger reactions of greater than or equalto 10 mm are considered positive in recent (within the last five years)immigrants from high-prevalence countries, in individuals with diabetes, renalfailure, and health-care workers, among others. Our patient falls into thiscategory. In individuals with no known risks for TB, a positive reactionrequires a 15 mm or greater induration [10].
Many patients with suspected pulmonary TB do not produce sputum spontaneouslyor are smear-negative for AFB. We could not obtain sputum sample in our patientdue to absence of a productive cough and sputum induction was alsounsuccessful. Though the BAL sample did not show any AFB, the biopsy showedcaseating granuloma which could be found both in tubercular and nontubercularmycobacterial infections or fungal infections due to Coccidioides immitis and Histoplasma capsulatum. It was ultimately a DNA probe from her lungtissue that grew M. tuberculosis after 26 days.
With the use of PCR, nucleic acid sequences unique to M. tuberculosis can be detected directly in clinical specimens with better accuracy and urgencythan AFB smear and culture, respectively. Probes are used for rapididentification and maximizing cost effectiveness. Used alone or in combinationwith other identification methods, they serve as a substitute for biochemicaltesting and are also more accurate [11]. Molecular tests in combination with“classic tests” can enhance the diagnostic ability particularly inpauci-bacillary infections and in patients with atypical presentations likeours.
The risk of TB to health-care workers is real. In the early 1990s, many urban US  hospitals reported purified protein derivative (PPD) conversion rates in health-careworkers of 3–5% [15]. A survey of US  hospitals conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)found a mean conversion rate of 1.6% [16, 17]. More recent studies havedemonstrated rates of around 1% annually. Efficient control of nosocomial TB iscompromised by the same difficulties complicating community control hence a high degree of suspicion is required to recognise and isolate patients withTB. An improved clinical acumen, development of rapid diagnostic tests, and theinstitution of early empiric therapy are desirable to control this disease. Wecombined the use of bronchoscopy and M. tuberculosis complex-PCR whichprovided a good diagnostic yield in our patient.
An early diagnosis of TB infection in a pregnant woman is important as betterresults are seen in women who are detected with TB and have been treated beforethe onset of pregnancy or earlier in its course, when compared with untreatedpatients with TB [18]. Infant andmaternal mortality are between 30% and 40% in untreated active TB cases [19].Treatment should also be initiated when the probability is moderate-to-high.Although the drugs in the initial treatment regime cross the placenta, theseconcentrations do not appear to have harmful effect on the fetus [20]. Pregnantwomen with TB should also be tested for HIV as there is a higher incidence ofextrapulmonary TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) in this set of patients [18].Breast feeding should not be discouraged in women being treated with first-lineantituberculosis drugs because the concentrations in the breast milk aresubtherapeutic and too low to produce toxicity in the nursing new born. Therisks of second-line medications are unknown. The effect would likely be muchlower if the mother breast feeds before taking the medication. Similarly,breast milk is also inadequate as a treatment option for TB or latent TBinfection in newborns [19]. Close follow up of patients is essential sincecurrent therapy for TB infection is long and suboptimal adherence may result infailure of therapy.
Congenital TB is rare with symptoms typically developing during the second orthird week of life which include poor feeding, poor weight gain, cough,lethargy, and irritability. Other symptoms include fever, ear discharge, andskin lesions. Two possible routes of M. tuberculosis infection in uteroare (a) hematogenous infection through the umbilical vein, with primary lesionsin the liver and occasional porta hepatis lymphadenopathy; and (b) prenatalaspiration of infected fluid, with predominant pulmonary and gastrointestinaldisease [21, 22]. The criteria for congenital TB requires the infant to have atuberculous lesion (e.g., infiltrates on the chest radiograph or granulomas)and at least one of the following: (a) onset during the first week of life, (b)presence of a primary hepatic TB complex or caseating hepatic granulomas, (c)infection of the placenta or maternal genital tract, or (d) exclusion ofpostnatal transmission [22].
 The role of Bacillus of Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine in preventing TB inadults is debatable due to its variable efficacy (0–80%) [23]. Its efficacy inprevention of tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB in young children has beeneasier to document than in adults or in the prevention of pulmonary TB in bothchildren and adults [24]. The Centers for Disease Control has made thefollowing recommendations concerning BCG vaccination in the US  [25]. (i)BCG vaccination should be considered in infants and children 5 years ifthe child is exposed continually to an untreated or ineffectively treatedpatient with infectious pulmonary TB, if the child cannot be separated from the presenceof the infectious patient or be given long-term primary preventive therapy, or if the child is exposedcontinually to a patient with infectious pulmonary TB caused by M.tuberculosis strains resistant to isoniazid and rifampin and the childcannot be separated from the presence of the infectious patient. (ii) Health-careworkers in high-risk settings should be considered on an individual basisin settings in which a high percentage of TB patients are infected with M.tuberculosis strains resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, transmissionand subsequent infection are likely and where comprehensive TBinfection-control precautions have been implemented and have not beensuccessful.
Our case emphasizes the significance of identifying infectious diseases like TBin developing countries due to a change in demographics. It also underscoresthe importance of an early diagnosis and treatment even in the backdrop ofconfounding evidence in pregnant women due to better maternal and perinataloutcomes. A heightened index of suspicion and awareness of the rapid advancesand innovations made in the diagnosis of TB is also essential for bettercontrol of this disease.
