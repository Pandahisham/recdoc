Recently, traditional therapists use one chemical component (e.g. Apitoxin) for injection therapy using a syringe, instead of sting method with bee itself as to be known traditional method. 31-year-old woman had a lower back pain because of mild HIVD in lumbar spine for 5 months. She had bee-sting therapies for several times for 4 months. During this period, she didn't have any side effects and pain was improved. Her back pain recurred 4 weeks ago and had bee-sting therapy again. The traditional doctor performed intramuscular injections of 1 mL of Apitoxin on her lower back muscle.
