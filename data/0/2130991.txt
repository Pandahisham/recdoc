BLOOD SUGAR STUDIES 

 1. During bacterial anaphylaxis there is a gradual rise in the blood sugar level, which attains an extremely high value at the time of death. 2. The curve of blood sugar is quite similar whether anaphylaxis is induced by organisms which affect the blood sugar in the unsensitized animal or by organisms which have no such effect. 3. No instances occurred in which there was not a marked hyperglycemia in anaphylaxis.
