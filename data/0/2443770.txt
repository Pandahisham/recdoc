Twenty patients received transduodenal sphincteroplasty and transampullary septectomy between 1987and 1993. Seven patients had post-cholecystectomy pain which was much improved or abolished in 5 of 7patients at a mean follow-up of 4 years and 5 months. Four of five patients with chronic pancreatitis wereimproved at 3 years and 2 months. Three of five patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis were improvedat 4 years and 5 months. One of three patients with chronic abdominal pain of hepatobiliary origin wasimproved at 3 years. Transduodenal sphincteroplasty and transampullary septectomy can relieve pain inpatients with post-cholecystectomy pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and chronicabdominal pain of hepatobiliary origin, presumably by improving drainage of the obstructed ducts.
