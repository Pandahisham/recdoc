IMMUNOCHEMICAL STUDIES ON THE SPECIFIC CARBOHYDRATE OF GROUP G STREPTOCOCCI

 Group G hemolytic streptococcal cell walls which have been treated with trypsin are composed of a group-specific polysaccharide moiety and a mucopeptide matrix. The mucopeptide contains N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, and glycine, a composition similar to that of other groups of streptococci. The Group G carbohydrate is composed of rhamnose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and galactose. Serological studies suggest that the monosaccharide of L-rhamnose is a major component of the determinant of antigenic specificity.
