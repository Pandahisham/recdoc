Weight variations in the prophylactic therapy of primary headaches: 6–month follow–up

We conducted a study on367 patients (86% female, 14% male;mean age 37±15 years) sufferingfrom migraine with and without auraand chronic tension–type headache toevaluate the incidence of weight gain,an undesirable side effect observedduring prophylactic therapy in primaryheadaches. Patients treated withamitriptyline (20 and 40 mg), pizotifen(1 mg), propranolol (80–160mg), atenolol (50–100 mg), verapamil(160–240 mg), valproate (600mg) and gabapentin (900–1200 mg)were evaluated after a period of 3 and6 months. In particular, 89 patientswere assessed (78% female, 22%male) at 6 months, of whom 10 werein treatment with amitriptyline 20mg, 19 with amitriptyline 40 mg, 7with pizotifen (1 mg), 13 with propranolol(80–160 mg), 4 with verapamil(160 mg), 10 with valproate(600 mg), 15 with atenolol (50 mg)and 11 with gabapentin (900–1200mg). The control group consisted of97 patients with migraine (79%female, 21% male; mean age 35±16years) without indication for prophylactictherapy. Weight variations ≥1kg were considered. After 6 monthsof therapy, the percentage of patientswith weight gain was 86% with pizotifen(6/7; mean weight increase4.4±2.5 kg), 60% with amitriptyline20 mg (6/10; 3.1±1.6), 47% withamitriptyline 40 mg (9/19; 5.4±2.7),25% with valproate 600 mg (2/8,3.0±2.8 kg), 25% with verapamil(1/4, 2.5 kg), 20% with atenolol(3/15, 1.7±0.6 kg), 9% withgabapentin (1/11, 1.5 kg) and 8%with propranolol (1/13; 6 kg). Weconclude that propranolol,gabapentin, atenolol, verapamil andvalproate affect body weight in amodest percentage of patients at 6months. A greater mean weight gainat 6 months was found in patientstreated with pizotifen, amitriptyline,and, in one patient out of 13, withpropranolol.
