 1. There is no increased immunity or tolerance to intestinal obstruction after recovery from previous obstruction. 2. Dogs recovered from intestinal obstruction are not more resistant to injections of closed loop fluid than normal dogs. 3.

In dogs the normal variation in resistance both to intestinal obstruction and to the injection of closed loop fluid is large.
