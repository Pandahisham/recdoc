THE INTRARENAL PRESSURE 

 1. The intrarenal pressure of dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital averages 26 mm. Hg, and ranges from 10 to 58 mm.; that of decerebrate dogs is 25 mm., and that of unanesthetized dogs with explanted kidneys is 25 mm. Tests of a few cats and rabbits indicate that their intrarenal pressure has about the same magnitude. 2. There is a slight positive correlation between intrarenal pressure and both body weight and kidney weight, but intrarenal pressure is not related to sex, blood pressure, or age.
