Heterozygous deficiency of δ-catenin impairs pathological angiogenesis


Vol. 207, No. 1, January 18, 2010. Pages 77–84.
The authors regret that in the original article the molecular weight of δ-catenin was erroneously listed as 88 kD, rather than 130 kD, in Figs. 1, 2, 4, 7, and S2. This error has been corrected in the html and pdf versions of the article.
