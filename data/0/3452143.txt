There were 282 patients over 65 years of age atthe first visit, corresponding to 6.4% of the study population.Primary headaches were diagnosed in 81.6% of the cases, whilesecondary headaches and non-classifiable headaches represented,respectively, 14.9% and 3.5% of the cases. Among primaryheadaches, the prevalence was almost the same for migrainewithout aura (27.8%), transformed migraine (26.1%) and chronictension- type headache (25.7%).
