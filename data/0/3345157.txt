A Clip in the Heart


These echocardiography images are of a 58-year-old Palestinian lady, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with refractory heart failure, NYHA III/IV. Echocardiography examination showed severe mitral incompetence and an ejection fraction (EF) <30%. Because of co-morbidities, she was considered to be at high risk for cardiac surgery. She was referred for percutaneous mitral valve clip. A 6-month follow-up echocardiography study showed the clip in position [Figures 1 and 2] with mild residual mitral incompetence [Figure 2a]. Left ventricular dimensions and function improved, and the patient was asymptomatic.

(a) Apical four-chamber view in systole with mild residual mitral incompetence appearing as two central jets (arrow); (b) apical four chamber view in diastole with two color flow jets of mitral inflow(arrow)
