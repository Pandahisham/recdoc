Cost Comparison of Laparoscopic versus Open Procedures at the Sydney Women's Endosurgery Centre

The objective of this study was to provide a cost comparison between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery from January 1996 to January 1998. The setting for this study was three private hospitals and one public hospital associated with the Sydney Women's Endosurgery Centre. Cost analysis was done using the costing provided by the private and public hospitals representing the total amount charged to the patient or the fund for their entire stay including disposable laparoscopic instruments and miscellaneous charges. We looked at laparoscopic hysterectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy, laparoscopic Burch colposuspension and open Burch colposus-pension. Despite the difficulties and limitations using our method of cost analysis, it appears that laparoscopic surgery is a less costly alternative to open abdominal surgery, particularly where the amount of disposable instruments are kept to a minimum. When the added advantages of early return to normal activities, family and workplace are added in, it is clear that providers of health care in the public and private sector will see laparoscopic surgery as an increasingly desirable option.
