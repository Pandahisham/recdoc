REACTION TIME DEFICITS IN POST TRAUMATIC SYNDROME

8 patients with closed head injury with post concussional symptoms were compared with normal on both simple and choice reaction time. The choice reaction time was significantly prolonged in the head injury patients although in four patients the symptoms had lasted over 2 years after the head injury, indicating an etiological relationship to post traumatic syndrome.
