Nateglinide is Effective for Diabetes Mellitus with Reactive Hypoglycemia in a Child with aCompound Heterozygous ABCC8 Mutation

ABCC8 encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits of the beta-cell ATP-sensitivepotassium (K-ATP) channel playing a critical role in the regulation of insulin secretion, and inactivatingmutations in ABCC8 cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Recently, ABCC8inactivating mutations were reported to be involved in the development of diabetes mellitus later in life. Wereport a girl who was born macrosomic with transient hypoglycemia and thereafter developed diabetes mellitusaccompanied by severe reactive hypoglycemia at the age of 11 yr. An OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test)revealed hyperglycemia due to poor early insulin response and subsequent hypoglycemia due to delayed prolongedinsulin secretion. Hypoglycemia was improved by the combination of nateglinide, which stimulates early insulinsecretion, and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose. Sequencing of the ABCC8 identifieda compound heterozygous mutation (R1420H/F591fs604X), suggesting that this mutation may alter regulation ofinsulin secretion with advancing age, leading to diabetes mellitus with reactive hypoglycemia fromhyperinsulinism. Therefore, long-term follow-up and periodic OGTTs are important for early detection ofinsulin dysregulation in congenital hyperinsulinism patients carrying the ABCC8 mutation,even though hypoglycemia resolves spontaneously during infancy. Furthermore, nateglinide may be usefultherapeutically in the treatment of not only diabetes mellitus but also reactive hypoglycemia.

The pancreatic beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels play a critical role in regulation ofglucose-induced insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis. The K-ATP channel is a hetero-octamericcomplex composed of two types of subunits: four sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits and fourinward-rectifying potassium channel pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits encoded by the genes ABCC8and KCNJ11, respectively. Increased blood glucose (BG) levels lead to a high ATP/ADP ratio andK-ATP channel closure in pancreatic beta cells, resulting in cell membrane depolarization, which then triggersthe opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, calcium influx and a rise in intracellular calcium concentration,thereby resulting in exocytosis of insulin granules (1, 2). Inactivating mutations in ABCC8 orKCNJ11 cause congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) characterized by hypoglycemia withinappropriate insulin secretion in infancy (3,4,5,6). CHI isusually treated by medical therapy including diazoxide and octreotide acetate. However, patients with CHI due toABCC8/KCNJ11 mutations are not always responsive to medical treatment andsometimes require pancreatectomy, resulting in a high incidence of diabetes mellitus. On the other hand,ABCC8 inactivating mutations in nonpancreatectomized patients have recently been reported tobe involved in the development of diabetes mellitus due to impaired insulin secretion later in life (7,8,9,10).
Reactive (or postprandial) hypoglycemia is a symptomatic hypoglycemia that occurs a few hours after eating(especially a high carbohydrate meal or oral glucose load), and the symptoms are improved by intake of glucose.The etiology of reactive hypoglycemia includes dumping syndrome after stomach resection, nesidioblastoma,insulinoma, impaired glucose tolerance/early diabetes mellitus, drugs or other rare mechanisms (11).
Here we described a compound heterozygous mutation in ABCC8 in a Japanese girl who was bornmacrosomic with transient hypoglycemia and thereafter developed diabetes mellitus accompanied by repeatedreactive hypoglycemia in childhood. In addition, the patient was successfully treated by nateglinide, whichstimulated early insulin secretion.
The propositus was the first child of healthy, unrelated Japanese parents. She was born at 34 wk of gestationby vaginal delivery. She was large for her gestational age, with a birth weight of 3,384 g and a height of 49.0cm, respectively. On the second day of age, she suffered severe symptomatic hypoglycemia (a blood glucose levelbelow the detection range). She required high concentrated glucose infusion until 10 d of age. Brain MRIfindings were compatible with periventricular leukomalacia. Her cousin on her father’s side, now 10 yr old, wasalso born macrosomic at 36 wk of gestation, with a birth weight of 4,244 g. Although he sufferedhyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia during his infancy, hypoglycemia spontaneously improved without diazoxide or othermedication. No other family members reported any hypoglycemic episodes or a diabetes mellitus history.
During her infancy, hypoglycemia repeatedly occurred, and glucose infusion was required each time. Although theepisodes of hypoglycemia gradually decreased after 6 yr of age, she again suffered repeated symptomaticaketogenic hypoglycemia in the late morning or early evening from 10 yr of age, and the frequency was increased.She was investigated for hypoglycemia at 11 yr of age when her growth was normal, with a weight of 50.8 kg (BMI21.6) and a height of 153.2 cm (+1.25 SD). Her physical findings were not remarkable except for mildmacroglossia, and she was not mentally retarded. She developed symptomatic aketogenic hypoglycemia almost everyday (BG levels were between 41–76 mg/dl) in the late morning (10:00–11:00) or early evening (16:00–17:00) andoften required oral glucose or glucose infusion, although her BG level was not low at night or in the earlymorning (Table 1A). An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed ahigh BG level at 120 min (248 mg/dl) due to poor early insulin response, which was followed by hypoglycemia dueto delayed prolonged insulin secretion (BG was 44 mg/dl at 270 min) (Table2A, Fig. 1AFig. 1 Oral glucose tolerance test.A. Before treatment, the OGTT revealed hyperglycemia (glucose level at 120 min was 248 mg/dl) due to poorearly insulin secretion (insulin level at 120 min was 28.6 μU/ml), followed by hypoglycemia (glucose levelat 270 min was 44 mg/dl) due to delayed prolonged insulin secretion (insulin level at 270 min was 8.2μU/ml).B. After treatment with α-GI and nateglinide, the peak of insulin secretion was earlier and lowercompared with before treatment and hypoglycemia was improved.). The insulinogenic index was 0.15. Insulin response to a glucagon loading test was normal.Counter-regulatory hormone levels were also normal. HbA1c was elevated (6.8%, NGSP), and anti-GAD antibody andanti-insulin antibody were negative. Abdominal CT showed no obvious pancreatic lesion, and brain MRI showed nonew abnormal findings except for PVL. Epileptic findings were not shown on EEG. Based on these findings, she wasdiagnosed with diabetes mellitus with reactive hypoglycemia.

We first started medical therapy with an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (α-GI; voglibose) before each meal (0.6 mgper day) to control postprandial hyperglycemia and subsequent reactive hypoglycemia by slowing the digestion andabsorption of carbohydrates and preventing prolonged insulin secretion. However, it was not effective enough forreactive hypoglycemia, although postprandial hyperglycemia was slightly improved (Table 1B). Then we added nateglinide before breakfast and lunch (30 mg per day) tocontrol reactive hypoglycemia by stimulating early insulin secretion close to normal insulin kinetics.Nateglinide successfully decreased the frequency of hypoglycemia from almost everyday to a few times a month(Table 1C). One year later, we reexamined the OGTT just aftertaking nateglinide and voglibose. The peak of insulin secretion after oral glucose load was earlier and lowercompared with the previous one, and hypoglycemia was improved, although hyperglycemia was still recognized(Table 2B, Fig. 1B).HbA1c fluctuated between 5.7–6.2% (NGSP). She is now 12 yr old, and her quality of life has been improved,although she occasionally suffers mild hypoglycemia and needs supplementary food.
We analyzed genes involved in beta-cell functions, ABCC8, KCNJ11, andHNF4α. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient, her parentsand her cousin. Samples from the patient and her family were obtained after obtaining informed consent. Allcoding exons and exon/intron boundaries of ABCC8, KCNJ11 andHNF4α were PCR amplified and directly sequenced as previously reported (12). ABCC8 analysis identified a compound heterozygous mutation,c.4259G>A (p.R1420H; exon35) and c.1773delC (p.F591fs604X; exon12). No mutation was found inKCNJ11 and HNF4α. Her father and her cousin on her father’s side carried aheterozygous c.4259G>A mutation, and her mother carried a heterozygous c.1773delC mutation (Fig. 2Fig. 2 Pedigree of the family.Filled symbols represent persons with hypoglycemia. Subjects indicated by a black dot within the symbolwere heterozygous for mutations but had no clinical manifestations. The patient (indicated by the arrow)carried a compound heterozygous ABCC8 mutation, c4259G>A (p.R1420H; exon 35, paternal)and c1773 delC (p.F591fs604X; exon 12, maternal). Her cousin on her father’s side carried a heterozygousc.4259G>A mutation.).
 Pedigree of the family.
Filled symbols represent persons with hypoglycemia. Subjects indicated by a black dot within the symbolwere heterozygous for mutations but had no clinical manifestations. The patient (indicated by the arrow)carried a compound heterozygous ABCC8 mutation, c4259G>A (p.R1420H; exon 35, paternal)and c1773 delC (p.F591fs604X; exon 12, maternal). Her cousin on her father’s side carried a heterozygousc.4259G>A mutation.
The characteristic clinical course in our case is that a patient carrying a compound heterozygousABCC8 mutation (R1420H/F591fs604X) was born macrosomic with severe hypoglycemia in theneonatal period followed by development of diabetes mellitus accompanied by repeated reactive hypoglycemia inchildhood. Although we could not determine her insulin level during hypoglycemia in the neonatal period, wepresumed that she developed hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the neonatal period because she was bornmacrosomic, suggesting intrauterine fetal hyperinsulinism.
Recently, there have been some reports of late-onset diabetes mellitus in nonpancreatectomized patients afterCHI in infancy due to ABCC8 inactivated mutations. Huopio et al. reported thata heterozygous E1506K mutation in ABCC8 caused CHI in infancy, loss of insulin secretorycapacity in early childhood and diabetes mellitus in middle age (7, 13). Vieira et al. also reported a patient carrying the samemutation who developed gestational diabetes and diabetes mellitus in adulthood after mild hypoglycemia ininfancy (10). On the other hand, Abdulhadi-Atwan et al.reported diabetes mellitus development at 10.5 yr after mild hypoglycemia during infancy in a patient carrying aheterozygous R370S mutation in ABCC8 (8). Gussinyeret al. reported development of glucose metabolism impairment from glucose intolerance toinsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in 3 nonpancreatectomized patients with compound heterozygousABCC8 mutations (9). All 3 patients presentedpersistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy unresponsive to diazoxide, and OGTTs were performed. Patient1 had a diabetic OGTT response with hypoglycemic episodes at 22 yr of age, followed by overt insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus without hypoglycemia at the age of 25 yr. In Patient 2, who was 17 yr of age, diabetic OGTTresponses and hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes were observed from 10 yr of age despite normal HbA1Cvalues. In Patient 3, who was 24 yr of age, intolerant OGTT responses were observed from 16 yr of age.Furthermore, there is a report that the acute insulin response to glucose was blunted in nonpancreatectomizedchildren with diffuse hyperinsulinism, suggesting the increased risk of diabetes mellitus later in life (14). However, the precise mechanism of transition with age fromhyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia to hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia due to ABCC8 mutation is notknown.
In K-ATP channel KO mice (Kir6.2−/− and SUR1−/−) or transgenic mice expressing adominant-negative form of Kir6.2, hypoglycemia with hyperinsulinemia occurs in neonates followed byhyperglycemia with insulin secretory failure in adults (15,16,17,18). It was also shown that disruption of the K-ATP channel induced elevation of the basal calciumconcentration and apoptosis in beta cells (15, 19). Therefore, it has been speculated that the chronic elevation of the intracellularcalcium concentration due to mutant K-ATP channel closure induces apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells, resultingin loss of beta-cell mass and decreased insulin secretion (18, 20). Indeed persistent increased beta-cell apoptosis was also observed inpancreases from CHI patients (21).
The patient we described carried a compound heterozygous ABCC8 mutation, c4259G>A (R1420H;exon 35, paternal) and c1773 delC (F591fs604X; exon 12, maternal). R1420 is located in the second nucleotidebinding fold (NBF2) of SUR1, and homozygous missense mutation R1420C is reported in Japanese CHI siblings (22). Although they were born macrosomic and developed hypoglycemia soon afterbirth, hypoglycemia resolve spontaneously after 3 mo of age. Functional analysis of the mutant R1420C SUR1showed lower expression of the mutant channel and reduced affinity of NFB2 for MgADP that might lead to theenhanced insulin secretion (23). Although the substituted amino acid wasdifferent and the mutation was compound heterozygous in our case, the R1420H mutation may also impair K-ATPchannel activity. However, it is unknown why the patient’s father is healthy and her cousin developedhypoglycemia in infancy despite carrying the same heterozygous mutation. On the other hand, we presume that theF591fs604X mutation from the maternal allele is also pathogenic because it is a frameshift mutation leading totruncated protein, which might be nonfunctional.
Our patient developed diabetes mellitus accompanied by repeated reactive hypoglycemia, and it was hard tocontrol not only hyperglycemia but also reactive hypoglycemia. Reactive hypoglycemia usually occurred in thelate morning or early evening, and not at night. Not only taking supplementary food for reactive hypoglycemiaand subsequently dinner but also the secretions of counter-regulatory hormones triggered by hypoglycemia mightprevent reactive hypoglycemia after dinner. The OGTT before treatment showed that hyperglycemia developed due todelayed early insulin response to an elevation of blood glucose levels and that reactive hypoglycemia developeddue to delayed suppression of insulin secretion in response to a fall in blood glucose levels. Therefore, it issuggested that the response to glucose metabolic change was impaired in the mutant K-ATP channel. In our case,we could not control reactive hypoglycemia with only an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which is described aseffective for reactive hypoglycemia (24, 25). However, the combination of α-GI and nateglinide could obviously decrease episodes of reactivehypoglycemia, although this combination has not been reported to be effective for reactive hypoglycemia.Nateglinide is a D-phenylalanine derivative antihyperglycemic drug that stimulates early insulin secretion, andit has a shorter duration of action than sulfonylurea. Considering its action, it has been expected thatnateglinide is effective for diabetes mellitus with reactive hypoglycemia by inducing early insulin secretionand preventing delayed prolonged insulin secretion (26). In fact, wecould control not only hyperglycemia but also reactive hypoglycemia with the combination of α-GI andnateglinide.
In conclusion, our case showed that a SUR1 mutation in CHI could alter regulation of insulin secretion withadvancing age, leading to diabetes mellitus with reactive hypoglycemia from hyperinsulinism. Therefore, we thinkthat long-term follow-up and periodic OGTTs are important for early detection of insulin dysregulation in CHIpatients carrying a SUR1 mutation, even though hypoglycemia resolves spontaneously without pancreatectomy duringinfancy. Furthermore, nateglinide may be useful therapeutically in the treatment of reactive hypoglycemia withimpaired glucose tolerance/early diabetes mellitus.
