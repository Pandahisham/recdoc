Technical Reviews


A technical review is a balanced review and analysis of the literature on a scientific or medical topic related to diabetes. The technical review provides a scientific rationale for a position statement and undergoes critical peer review before submission to the Professional Practice Committee for approval. In some cases, original research publications, conference proceedings, or other comprehensive review articles are used as the basis for a position statement instead of a technical review. Listed below are recent technical reviews.
