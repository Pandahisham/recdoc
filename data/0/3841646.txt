Racemose neurocysticercosis and reversible dementia


Sir,
The recent publication on racemose neurocysticercosis (NCC) and reversible dementia is very interesting.[1] Sharma et al. reported that “The outcome of dementia patients with NCC seems favorable in most cases; therefore, a high index of suspicion for NCC should be kept, especially in endemic areas.”[1] Indeed, the neurological symptom is not rate in NCC. Indeed, the existing of dementia and cognitive function impairment in NCC is more common in non-calcified active NCC.[2] Nearly, 40% of all non-calcified active NCC can present with dementia. In the real life, dementia might be lately detected and clinical work-up does usually not include looking for NCC. Focusing on the outcome; although, the present report showed favorable outcome.[1] Some previous reports mentioned for discordant observation after complete treatment.[3]
