 Mandai et al. Vol. 139, No. 2, Oct. 20, 1997. Pages 517–528.In the above-mentioned manuscript, “kilodalton” was mistakenly inserted in place of “Kd” in  three instances. On p. 522, first column, line 13, the sentence should read “The Kd value was calculated to be the order of 10−7 M.” Similar errors appear on p. 525, second column, one line from  the bottom, and on p. 526, first column, line 6.
