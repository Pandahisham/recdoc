STUDIES ON THE FLEXNER GROUP OF DYSENTERY BACILLI 

 1. The toxicity of killed dysentery bacilli can be ascribed to the somatic antigen. Antibodies to intact dysentery bacilli apparently contain no toxin-neutralizing antibodies other than those which precipitate the purified somatic antigen. 2. The serological properties of dysentery bacilli are determined by the specific somatic antigen. The specificity and cross-reactivity of the somatic antigen are dependent upon the carbohydrate moiety of the molecular complex.
