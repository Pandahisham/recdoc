High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) competes with radiofrequency and cryotherapy for the treatment of small renal masses as a third option among ablative approaches. As an emerging technique, its possible percutaneous or laparoscopic application, low discomfort to the patient and the absence of complications make this technology attractive for the management of small renal masses. This manuscript will focus on the principles, basic research and clinical applications of HIFU in small renal masses, reviewing the present literature.Therapeutic results are controversial and from an clinical view, HIFU must be considered a technique under investigation at present time. Further research is needed to settle its real indications in the management of small renal masses; maybe technical improvements will certainly facilitate its use in the management of small renal masses in the near future.

We are  facing a rapid				 increase of incidentally  detected small renal masses (SRMs) nowadays  [1, 2], prompting us to face many different clinical scenarios and probably minimally invasiveablative techniques will  find their role in those unfit patients who are notoperable and do not accept a partial nephrectomy or a watchful waiting policy [3]in case of a possible renal cell carcinoma (RCC) diagnosed probablyincidentally [4].
High-intensity focusedultrasound (HIFU) induces thermal damage to the targeted tissue without theneed of the insertionof a probe into the tissue, thus being the most real “minimally invasive”proposed technique among the ablative treatments for small renal masses (SRMs).			
This manuscript willfocus on the principles, basic research, and clinical applications of HIFU insmall renal masses, reviewing the present literature and analyzing HIFU as apossible treatment for SRM, recognizing no experience in its use for any renal massesby our group.
We reviewed PubMed withno limit on time, searching for papers in English or Spanish, using HIFU and renalor HIFU and kidney as key words. We included the literature published on HIFUboth in the experimental and clinical settings.
The principle of HIFUresembles the one for ultrasound (US), but a higher intensity isused. Ultrasound is progressively absorbed by the tissue and its mechanicalenergy converted to heat. At a high and focused strategy, the generated heatdenatures proteins and produces coagulative necrosis, objectives obtained whentemperature reaches 65°C in renal lesions [5]. The induction of thermal necrosis will depend on severalfactors: the applied power, the US  frequency, transducer characteristics (shape, type, size, and number ofprobes), exposure time, spatial distribution of the field, absorptionproperties of the tissue, attenuation in the intervening tissue, acousticreflection and refraction, and  finally the perfusion rate in the targetedtissue.  Different necrosisrates were shown (volume of ablated tissue per 1 second isonication) for different organs, and forexample, the kidney has a lower necrosis rate than the liver [6].
As a technique under development, there are nostandard recommendations for its application and this is a point under vastresearch. Initially, extracorporeal HIFU generators used multiple piezoelectricelements located in a concave disk, generating intensities of >10000 W/cm2which were derivedin cavitation lesions, limitating its use in humans [7]. Nowadays, HIFU systemsuse single transducers, focused by acoustic lenses or by being concave. As thefocal lengths are smaller, frequencies of 3-4 MHz can beachieved, producing smaller but better defined lesions. Modern HIFU devicesobtain focal depths of 10–16 cm; the focalzones are cigar shaped and the volume ablated depends on power intensity,duration of application, and location of pulses. All this equipment isaccompanied by US regular probes trying to control the effectiveness of theHIFU application; interestingly, as power intensity increases (5–20 kW/cm2),a cavitation phenomenon appears which permits a target point to monitor HIFUeffects [8]. An excellentsummary on physical principles and devices of HIFU [9] has recently beenpublished.			
In the extracorporealapproach, frequencies of 1–1.8 MHz are usedin an attempt to increase penetration; in this range, renal thermal lesionswere observed in  animal models [10, 11]. In theclinical setting, twosystems for  extracorporeal HIFU have been tested. First, from StorzMedical (Storz; Schaffhausen, Switzerland), we use a1 MHz piezo element focused at a depth of 100 mm with a parabolic reflector of10 cm aperture. An integrated 3.5 MHz B-mode US  transducerpermits inline imaging of the area to treat. The US  beam is coupled into the body bya flexible polyurethane cushion filled with degassed water at 16°C, witch permits the variation of theskin-focal spot distance altering its filling [12]. The second HIFU therapeuticsystem was designed by Chonqing Haifu CO. Ltd (Chonqing, China);it is composed by a patient table, an operating console, and a treatment unit,situated under the table within a basin filled with degassed water to couplewith US delivered to the patient, who lies over the water bath. Exchangeableellipsoidal transducers of 12 or 15 cm diameter are installed in the water batharound a central 3.5 MHz diagnostic transducer. This system permits frequenciesof 0.5, 1.2, and 1.5 MHz and focal lengths of 100–160 mm dependingon the transducer used. Following the treatment protocol and by exposing thetargeted areas up to six times, the authors achieve an estimated site intensityof up to 20000 W/cm2, enough to create cavitation and even bubble formation onreal-time diagnostic imaging, which authors propose as successful tissueablation marker [13].
Due to the problems withextracorporeal HIFU applications that we will further comment on, the equipmentmoved into the  laparoscopic field. In porcine models, it was modified with acceptable partial kidneyablation  with no damage to surrounding not targeted tissues [14].				 In phaseI study, this approach was attempted in the human setting, using conventionallap isolation of the SRM through four 12 mm access ports; authors usedintraoperative renal power Doppler US with a 10 Hz laparoscopic US probe (BKMedical, Denmark) to  locate the SRM. They then changed one of the ports to an18 mm port (Ethicon; San Angelo, Tx, USA) to introduce the laparoscopic HIFU system (Sonatherm, MisonixInc., Fiarmigdale, NY, USA), which is composed by a treatment console, anarticulated probe arm,a pomp unit, andthe laparoscopic probe (covered with a system which permits cooling withgas-free cold water) [15]. HIFU energy is delivered by a truncated sphericalshell 4 MHz transducer with a 30 × 13 mm aperture and a 35 mm focal length. One ofthe best improvements of this approach, compared to the percutaneous one, isthat the probe works in direct contact with the SRM and real-time imaging,based on qualitative assess on hyperechoic changes resulting from boiling andcavitation events, permittingdirect control of the procedure with the 12 mm transducer aligned confocallywith the HIFU transducer. The procedure was calibrated resembling the resultsobtained in animal models research to ablate tissue at an average rate of 0.6 cm3/min at typical power level between 30–38 W [14, 16].
We found 42 manuscripts using HIFU andrenal/kidney as key words. HIFU has been extensively used in other organs,targeted to malignant and nonmalignant tissues: brain, breast, eye, prostate,bladder, uterus, liver, and so forth, showing no increase in cell dissemination[17–20]. Anattractive indication for tumour in a solitary testis has been recentlypublished with acceptable results [21].
The thermal damageproduced by HIFU causes progressive tissue changes depending on the time whenthe pathological study is done. Immediately after its application in a porcinemodel, the tissue demonstrated intense congestion, hyperaemia, and alterationsof the micropapillaries, and electron microscopy showed alterations of the mitochondria,ribosomes, and lysozymes. At day 2, necrosis starts to be seen within anintense area of hyperaemia and congestion which results in complete necrosis atday 7. Finally, at day 90, a complete fibrosis of the targeted area is observed[22]. On healthy human kidney, haemorrhages were seen in 15 out of 19 cases andmicroscopically, it was shown that they were caused by fibre ruptures in thewall of small vessels [23]. In papers where SRMs have been excised after HIFU application,“severe thermal tissue damage” has been defined as intravascular disruption oferythrocyte membranes, vacuolisation of tumour and arterial smooth musclecells, pycnosis and elongation of tumour cell nuclei, rupture of tumour cellmembranes, and cell detachment, changes which correspond to complete tissuenecrosis if the time elapsed from HIFU application and specimen removal islonger [24]. Negative NADH staining in snap-frozen tissue obtained beforetissue fixation with formaldehyde after HIFU treatment also reaffirmsirreversible heat damage [15, 24].
Linke et al. were the first to treat akidney of a rabbit using extracorporeal HIFU [25]. When applied percutaneouslyin a rabbit model, it was clearly showed that only 2 out of 9 tumours showedwell-demarcated effects of ablation [26]. Watkin et al. treated 18-pig kidneys with acute damage detected in 67% [11].In a canine model, HIFU application with 400 W power and 4-second pulseduration and a calculated site intensity of 1430 W/h obtained coagulativenecrosis of variable degree in the targeted area [12]. Recently, the use ofmicrobubbles injected before percutaneous HIFU isonication of goat kidneysshowed better necrosis rates than direct HIFU application [13].
In humans, phase II study using theStorz system was conducted by the University of Vienna. Sixteen renaltumours were treated with HIFU, two with curative intent and 14 were subsequentlyremoved. Examination of the specimens showed poor results in terms oftherapeutic effect, as necrosis was found only in 9 out of 14 cases, all ofwhich had been exposed to the highest site intensities, and the histologicallydamaged tissue only composed 15–35% of thetargeted tissue [27]. In another phase II study, Häcker et al. treated 19 patients with RCC before nephrectomy, focusing HIFU tohealthy renal tissue; after immediate removal of the kidney, they observedvariable but limited pathological signs of thermal damage, as for examplehaemorrhages, just in 15 out of 19 specimens, but these effects could not becorrelated to the energy administered and lesion size did never reach thetargeted volume [23].
When usingthe Chongqing  system,Wu et al. applied percutaneous HIFU with a palliative intent in 13 advancedRCC, having shown clinical improvement (less pain and disappearance ofhaematuria) in most of the treated patients, although treatment was consideredincomplete in 10 patients [18]. Similar disappointing results were publishedfrom UK,where 8 patients were treated with a similar system and only 4 out of 6 kidneys showedradiological evidence of treatment effect on MRI 12 days after HIFU applicationand just 1 out of 4 removed kidneys showed histological confirmed ablation [17].This group is currently undergoing a prospective, nonrandomized clinical trialof percutaneous HIFU in the treatment of SRM, looking at histological outcomein resected tumours in one arm and following the ablated tumours with contrastenhanced MRI in theother arm [28].
In arecently published clinical phase I study, the laparoscopic HIFU approachpreviously described was applied to 10 patients with solitary renal masses. Twoof them had 9 cm tumours and HIFU was applied just as marker lesion beforeradical laparoscopic nephrectomy; the rest had SRM with a median size of 22 mmand were treated with a “curative intent” applying HIFU to the entire tumourwith a margin of 2-3 mm ofsurrounding parenchyma. Seven of these tumours were operated afterwards bymeans of a laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and one was left in situ in apatient with high comorbidities. In the SRM subgroup, a median HIFU exposuretime of 19 minutes (range 8–42) was used. Thefirst two patients showed, in the subsequent pathological examination, just a 2-3 mm of vitaltissue adjacent to where the HIFU probe was approximated with the rest of thetumour with thermal necrosis; the authors explained this phenomenon to anexcessive cooling of the probe, and changing this parameter, they did notobserve it again in the remaining cases, although a patient showed a 20% central area with nothermal effects, showing complete thermal necrosis in the 4 remaining removed cases(57%). The nonexcised tumourwas successfully treated attending to real-time US  data,examination of core biopsies showing thermal necrosis, and follow-up CT scansup to 6 months showing no constraintenhancement and shrinking of the lesion [15].
There havebeen just two severe complications due to HIFU application in the abdominalcavity in humans: a superior mesenteric artery infarction and a perforation ofthe terminal ileum, but both were after treatment of recurrent or metastaticcolon carcinoma [29]. When focused to kidneys, no serious side effects havebeen shown [27]; just 2 patients had grade III skin lesions [28], but the mostcommon type of skin toxicity is less than 1cm blister or track at the treatmentsite [17]. Changes in laboratory tests are also nonsignificant [17, 18].
 Technology has improved theinitial problems of the first HIFU intents to treat kidneys with devicesderived from piezoelectric lithotripters [22] which could not focus the targetedlesion; the development of a new HIFU source (Storz UTT System, Storz MedicalAG, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland) with a smaller (10 cm) diameter for flexibleextracorporeal application permitted the authors to focus precisely on thetargeted area in an ex vivo scenario with perfused kidneys, adjusting the pulseduration and the power of the generator to the lesion size [30].
One of the majorproblems with HIFU is that from an extracorporeal application, there areseveral factors that interfere between the power emitted by the ultrasoundprobe and the energy arriving to the targeted area: focal length, type, andcharacteristics of the tissue to be crossed through variable vascularization of the kidney andits mobility as well asthe limitation proximity of air (gut) or bone (ribs) because ofreverberation, acoustic shadowing, and refraction [31], the last with burningpower with potential damage to close organs.
Another drawback of percutaneousHIFU application is the absence of a reliable radiologic method controlling theeffects of HIFU in real time. Research is being done to find more fixed devicescoupled with respiratory movements trying to save absorption of ultrasoundenergy from nontargeted tissues like ribs, fat, or muscles; MRI is being moreextensively proposed as a guide to the treatment compared with regularultrasound due to its information regarding temperature changes in the treatedtissue within seconds after application [31]. Unfortunately, movement of thekidney also affects the accuracy of MRI thermometry [32]. Mobility has beenpartly corrected using multichannel focused US  systems, trying to combinemotion tracking and feedback electronic steering of the HIFU beam [33] andmultiprobe systems of small-aperture confocal HIFU transducers that also theoreticallypermit more flexible targeting [34, 35].
All these reasons could explain thepoor results in the clinical setting, mostly when histopathological assessmentof thermal necrosis on the targeted tissue has been studied. The limitedclinical experience with the extracorporeal approach and its poor results makethis approach not suitable to treat renal cancer in humans, and it has to beconsidered a technique under experimental research [12].
Although percutaneous approach wouldbe the ideal and real “no invasive,” laparoscopic approach facilitatesresolutions of many of the problems facing the percutaneous approach. The use ofthe 18 mm laparoscopic HIFU transducer, applicable to conventional laparmamentarium and controlled by US, as shown by Klingler et al. in phase I study, indicatedjust for peripheral tumours not larger than 3.5 cm in size [15], opens a windowto clinical research with this method as it really does not clamp the kidney orpuncture it as other ablative techniques. Although the protocol is underevolution, the authors have shown safe and promising results with at leastbetter thermal necrosis results than those obtained with the percutaneous approach, but it has to bekept in mind that laparoscopy itself is not complication-free as it needsgeneral anaesthesia, pneumoperitoneum, and tumour isolation, so this approachwill have to be compared in randomized trials with other nonablative techniquesand also with watchful waiting policies in front of SRM in elderly or unfit patients,the subgroup of patients where it makes sense to avoid open or laparoscopicpartial nephrectomy for an SRM.
The follow-up of SRM treated withHIFU is generally performed by contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, but other methodssuch as PET and microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasound are under evaluation [36].Microbubbles increased the ablation efficiency and the visibility of tissuedestruction attending to the appearance of hyperechoic regions within thetargeted tissue [6]. As with the rest of the nonablative techniques, definitivefollow-up protocols are missing [37], and the role of the biopsy in contrast-enhancedlesions has to be investigated [38].
One of the advantagesof HIFU applications is that treatments could be repeated, but the need to doit under general anaesthesia results in a limitation of this strategy.
Vast research is neededto establish standards of pulse and power levels which ascertain tissue death,as well as the number and types of probes utilized, as in ex vivo porcine experiments, atidentical power levels, lesions induced by multiple probes were larger thanthose induced by single probe [34]. Another nonresolved issue is the finalextent of the coagulative thermal-induced necrosis with time. Finally,extracorporeal or laparoscopic approach will have to define their advantages.
Thus, to establish the clinicalusefulness of HIFU to treat SRM, long-term follow-up studies are needed takinginto account recurrence-free survival data, quality of life parameters,complications and cost analysis, and all these data compared in clinical trialswith open or laparoscopic partial nephrectomy as gold standard techniques [39],cryotherapy and radiofrequency as minimally invasive more developed techniques [40],and watchful waiting policy [3] as options to manage small renal masses.
HIFU is a promisingapproach to treat SRM because it is probably the most minimally invasive amongthe proposed techniques. Nevertheless, the number of treated patients is verysmall, and its results with the percutaneous approach make it not applicable tothe humans with a curative intent. Laparoscopic approach makes it a loose partof its “minimally invasive” principles, but preliminary data show betterthermal necrosis results and better US real-time control of the treatment.  For the moment, we think that HIFU has to beconsidered as an investigational technique. Technical improvements could certainlyfacilitate its use in the management of SRM in the near future.
