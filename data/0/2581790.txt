All urologists have faced patients suffering a renal cancer asking for the occurrence of the disease in their offspring and very often the answer to this question has not been well founded from the scientific point of view, and only in few cases a familial segregation tree is performed. The grate shift seen in the detection of small renal masses and renal cancer in the last decades will prompt us to know the indications for familial studies, which and when are necessary, and probably to refer those patients with a suspected familial syndrome to specialized oncological centers where the appropriate molecular and familial studies could be done. Use of molecular genetic testing for early identification of at-risk family members improves diagnostic certainty and would reduce costly screening procedures in at-risk members who have not inherited disease-causing mutations. This review will focus on the molecular bases of familial syndromes associated with small renal masses and the indications of familial studies in at-risk family members.

Renal cell carcinoma(RCC) affects approximately 150 000 people worldwide each year, causing close to 78 000 deaths annually, and its incidence seems to be rising [1]. This rising trend is partially dueto the growing use of new and improved noninvasive abdominal imagingmodalities, such as ultrasonography, CT, and MRI [2, 3]. In more recent years, 48–66% of RCCs havebeen detected incidentally as small renal masses in asymptomatic patients,whereas historically most cases were diagnosed following investigations for flankpain or hematuria [4]. RCC is not a single entity, but rathercomprises the class of tumors of renal epithelial origin. Broad histologicaland molecular studies have resulted in a consensus classification of differentRCC subtypes (Table 1) [5].
Most cases of RCC arethought to be sporadic whereas there has been estimated that hereditary RCCsyndromes are estimated at 1–4% but have majorclinical and scientific implications [6, 7]. First, the identification ofpredisposing gene offers the possibility of genetic testing: surveillance ofmutation carriers results in early diagnosis and treatment. Secondly, theinvolvement of the same genes is demonstrated in a number of sporadic RCCs, providinginsight into the various mechanisms of renal tumorigenesis [8]. To date, 10 familial syndromesassociated with one or more of the various histological subtypes of RCC havebeen described, all of them inherited with an autosomal dominant trait, thatmeans that carrier individuals of a mutant allelehave a 50% chance of passing the mutant gene to the offspring and therefore theassociated disorder (Table 2) [9]. The diverse nature of thesepredisposing genes implicates different mechanisms and biological pathways inRCC tumorigenesis. Hence, identification of mutations responsible for thesesyndromes in healthy carriers constitutes a challenge in the clinicalmanagement of these individuals.
There are no generally accepted screening guidelines for hereditary RCCsyndromes; however, some recommendations can be made. A hereditarypredisposition to renal cancer should be suspected whenever an individual whois diagnosed with renal cancer has a close relative also diagnosed with thedisease, and/or when an individual presents with multifocal renal tumors or ahistory of previous renal tumor. Family history should be obtained and apedigree created, paying specific attention to relatives with a known historyof cancer. Whenever possible (when a gene-causing disease is identifiable), agermline genetic testing should be performed on the proband. In addition, andas a general rule, molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members isappropriate in order to identify the need for continued, lifelong, clinicalsurveillance. Interpretation of the result is most accurate when a disease-causingmutation has been identified in an affected family member. Those who have a disease-causing mutation require lifelong regularsurveillance. Meanwhile, family members who have not inherited the mutation and their offspring have risks similar to the generalpopulation [10].
In this case, and generallyspeaking within a genetic testing context, the presence or absence of amutation in a predisposing gene or the type of mutation determines the clinicalactuation in cases of hereditary syndromes of cancer. In this sense, andfollowing the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommendations, wecan describe the following situations [10]:
Situation 1.When the mutation ispresent:					the pathogenic sequence alteration is reportedin the literature;sequence alteration is predicted to bepathogenic but not reported in the literature;sequence variation of unknown clinicalsignificance;sequence alteration is predicted to be benignbut not reported in the literature;a benign sequence alteration is reported in theliterature.

Herein we review thefour most frequent syndromes (von Hippel-Lindau, Hereditary papillary RCC,Hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC, and Birt-Hogg-Dubé), the molecular biology ofthe associated genes, and the clinical consequences of a genetic counseling.
VHL (OMIM: 193300) isthe main cause of inherited RCC [11]. This syndrome includes centralnervous system (CNS) and retinal hemangioblastomas, clear cell RCC and renalcysts, pheochromocytomas, neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors and pancreaticcysts, and endolymphatic sac tumors [12]. VHL occurs at a prevalence ofabout 1/36 000 and VHL-associated tumors with relatively high penetrance  (80–90%) develop in thesecond to fourth decades of life. RCC affects up to 75% of patients by the ageof 60 years. RCC is predominantly multiple and bilateral and occurs at a meanage of 39 years [11, 12] (Table 3).
Genetically, VHL is causedby germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene located on 3p25-26 accompanied by inactivation of thewild-type copy of the VHL gene in asusceptible cell through loss of heterozygosity (LOH), promoterhypermethylation, or somatic mutation [6].
VHL disease tumorsuppressor protein (pVHL) has been implicated in avariety of functions including transcriptional regulation, posttranscriptional gene expression, protein folding, extracellular matrixformation, and ubiquitinylation [13]. The role of pVHLin the regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes through thetargeted ubiquitinylation and degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) has beenelucidated, leading to a model of how disruption of the VHL gene results in RCC andthe production of highly vascularized tumors.
Under normoxicconditions, HIF1α is hydroxilated (−OH) on twoconserved praline residues by a member of the EGLN family of prolyl hydroxylaseenzymes. This hydroxylation provides a substrate-recognition site for thepVHL-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which contains elongins C and B, cullin-2(CUL2), and RBX1. Polyubiquitylation of HIF1α by the VHL complex leads to itsproteasomal degradation by the 26S proteasome [6] (Figure 1).
However, under hypoxicconditions, HIF1α is not hydroxylated, pVHL does notbind, and HIF1α subunits accumulate. HIF1α forms heterodimers with HIF1β and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes (i.e., VEGF, EPO, TGFα, PDGFβ). Likewise, when pVHL is absent or mutated, HIF1α subunits accumulate, resulting incell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHLdisease [13].
Mutations in the VHL gene either prevent its expression(i.e., deletions, and frameshifts, nonsense mutations, splice site mutations) or lead to theexpression of an abnormal protein (i.e., missense mutations), and interestinggenotype-phenotype correlations are emerging for VHL disease that relate to thedevelopment of RCC [14]. A group of VHL mutations termed type 1, comprising mostly deletions andpremature-termination mutations that cause total loss of pVHL function,predispose to the entire spectrum of VHL-syndrome except pheocromocytomas [15]. By contrast, type 2 mutations,which are mostly missense changes that reduce pVHL activity, predispose to theentire VHL spectrum, including pheochromocytomas with or without RCC, calledtype 2B and type 2A, respectively [6]. Several studies have revealed thattype 1 and type 2B mutations, which predispose to RCC, show complete loss of HIF1α ubiquitylation and regulation,whereas type 2A mutations result in an incomplete defect in HIF regulation [16]. However, type 2A mutations havebeen shown to disrupt binding of pVHL to microtubules and abrogate theassociated microtubule-stabilizing function of pVHL, implicating defectivecytoskeleton organization in this VHL phenotype [17]. A third VHL-syndrome subclass(type 2C)predisposes almost exclusively to pheochromocytomas [9]. Type 2C mutations produce pVHL thatregulates HIF but is defective in fibronectin assembly, indicating a possiblelink between fibronectin-matrix assembly and pheochromocytoma development [17]. Another class of VHL point mutations inactivates pVHLfunction by disrupting proper protein folding mediated by chaperonin TriC/CCT [18]. More recently, two independent groupsreported a reduced risk for RCC in individuals with a complete deletion of the VHL gene. This group of individuals would define a new VHL phenotype characterized by a low risk for both RCC andpheochromocytoma [19, 20].
The molecular genetictesting of VHL is mainly performed bysequence analysis of all three exons which detects point mutations and small deletions or insertionsand that represents the 72% of VHL mutations, and deletion analysis (by means of Southern Blot, MLPA, quantitativePCR, etc.) for detecting partial or complete gene deletions, which account for approximately28% of all VHL mutations [21, 22].
Over 300 different VHL germline mutations have beenidentified [6, 11]. The mutations occur in all three exons, with only a handful of mutations found in four or more families(i.e., delPhe76, Asn78Ser, Arg161X, Arg167Gln, Arg167Trp, Leu178Pro). Codon 167 is a hot spot mutation. A database of mutations in the VHL gene is maintained on the human gene mutation database website http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php.
Molecular genetic testing is indicated in all individualsknown to have or suspected of having VHL syndrome [23]. Since the detection rate for VHL gene mutations is nearly 100%, molecular testingmay also be used to evaluate individuals with a single VHL-associated tumor anda negative family history of the disease. In addition, for individuals withmanifestations of VHL syndrome who do not meet strict diagnostic criteria andwho do not have a detectable VHL germline mutation, somatic mosaicismfor a de novo VHL disease-causing mutation should be considered. In someinstances, molecular genetic testing of the offspring of suchindividuals reveals a VHL mutation [24].
The level of mutation detection obtained by molecular genetic testing of the VHL makes it possibleto effectively rule out VHL syndrome with a high degree of certainty inindividuals with isolated hemangioblastoma, retinal angioma,or clear cell RCC, who have no detectable VHL disease-causing germline mutation; somatic mosaicism for a VHL gene mutation still needs to be considered insuch individuals. A younger individual, especially one with multiple lesions,is more likely to have a germline VHL mutation than an older individual with asingle lesion [25].
Since pheochromocytomais part of the VHL syndrome spectrum and may occur as the exclusivemanifestation of VHL syndrome (type 2C),individuals with a family history of these tumors, or those in whomthe disease is bilateral or multifocal, should be offered molecular genetic testing for VHL germline mutations [26]. Germline VHL mutations are rare in simplex cases of unilateral pheochromocytoma(i.e., an affected individual with no family history of VHL syndrome), unless theindividual is younger than age 20 years. Exceptions are those individuals witha family history that is more consistent with familial paragangliomas of the head andneck, which are caused by mutations in various subunits of the gene encoding succinic dehydrogenase (SDH)[27, 28], or those individuals who havefeatures of other heritable diseases associated with pheochromocytoma such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2Aor 2B or neurofibromatosis type 1 [25].
Use of molecular genetic testing for early identification of at-risk family members improves diagnostic certainty andreduces the need for costly screening procedures in those at-risk familymembers who have not inherited the disease-causing mutation [29]. In addition, the American Societyof Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) identifies VHL syndrome as a Group 1 disorder, thatis, a hereditary syndrome for which genetic testing is considered part of thestandard management for at-risk family members [30]. Early recognition ofmanifestations of VHL syndrome may allow for timely intervention and improvedoutcome; thus, clinical surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk individuals,including children, for early manifestations of VHL syndrome is appropriate.
Geneticcounseling is the process of providing individuals and families withinformation on the nature, inheritance, and implications of genetic disordersto help them make informed medical and personal decisions.
As mentioned above, VHLsyndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and we call proband (orindex case) to the affected individual through whom a familywith a genetic disorder is ascertained. It has been reported that about 80% ofindividuals diagnosed with VHL syndrome have an affected parent whereas de novo mutations of the VHL gene are estimated to occur in about 20%of probands. Recommendations for the evaluationof parents of a proband with an apparent de novo mutation include molecular genetic testing if the VHL disease-causing mutation in the proband is known. If the disease-causing VHL mutation in the proband is not known, ophthalmologic screening and abdominal ultrasoundevaluation, at a minimum, should be offered to both parents [31].
In the case of the sibsof a proband, the risk of VHL syndrome to sibs depends upon the genetic statusof the parents: if a parent of a proband is clinically affected or has a disease-causing VHL mutation, the sibs ofthe proband are at 50% risk of inheriting the altered gene; and if neither parent has the disease-causing VHL mutation identified in the proband, the sibs have a small risk of VHL syndrome because ofthe possibility of germline mosaicism in one parent (at present the incidence of mosaicismis not known) [24].
Each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk ofinheriting the mutant VHL gene; but the degree of clinical severity isnot predictable (Figure 2), whereas the risk to other family members dependsupon their biological relationship to the affected family member and can be determinedby pedigree analysis and/or molecular genetic testing.
Molecular genetictesting of at-risk family members is appropriate in order to determine the needfor continued clinical surveillance. Interpretation of molecular genetic testresults is most accurate when a disease-causing germline mutation has beenidentified in an affected family member. Those who have the disease-causingmutation require regular surveillance, whereas family members who have notinherited the disease-causing mutation and their offspring need have nofuture concern [31].
Because early detectionof at-risk individuals affects medical management, testing of asymptomaticindividuals during childhood is beneficial [30]. As ophthalmologic screening forthose at risk for VHL syndrome begins as early as possible, certainly beforeage five years, molecular genetic testing may be considered in young children. Moleculargenetic testing may be performed earlier if the results would alter the medicalmanagement of the child.
The use of moleculargenetic testing for determining the genetic status of presumably at-riskrelatives when a family member with a clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome is notavailable for testing is less straightforward. Such test results need to beinterpreted with caution. A positive test result signals the presence of a VHL disease-causingmutation in the at-risk family member and indicates that the same molecular genetictesting method can be used to assess the genetic status of other at-risk familymembers. However, a negative test for a VHL gene mutation under such circumstances suggests one of thefollowing possibilities:
						the at-risk family member has not inherited a VHL disease-causingmutation;the familial VHL mutation may not be detectable by the assaysused; orthe diagnosis of VHL syndrome in the affected family member isquestionable.					
the at-risk family member has not inherited a VHL disease-causingmutation;
the familial VHL mutation may not be detectable by the assaysused; or
the diagnosis of VHL syndrome in the affected family member isquestionable.
In this situation, thepresumably at-risk family member has a small, but finite, residual risk ofhaving inherited a disease-causing allele (i.e., VHL syndrome or otherhereditary disorder). In counseling such individuals, careful considerationshould be given to the strength of the clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome inthe affected family member, the relationship ofthe at-risk individual to the affected family member, the perceived riskof an undetected VHL (or other) gene mutation, and the potential need for someform of continued clinical surveillance [31].
It is recommended thatphysicians ordering VHL molecular genetic testing and individualsconsidering undergoing testing understand the risks, benefits, and limitationsof the testing prior to sending a sample to a laboratory. In fact, in somecountries the individuals must give and sign an informed consent before thegenetic analysis.
When neither parent of aproband with an autosomal dominant condition has the disease-causing mutationor clinical evidence of the disorder, it is likely that the proband has a de novo mutation. However,possible nonmedical explanations including alternate paternity or maternity(i.e., with assisted reproduction) or undisclosed adoption could also becarefully explored.
Hereditary papillary RCC(HPRCC) (OMIM 605074) is characterized by the development of multifocal, bilateralpapillary type-1 RCCs (low-grade tumors with basophilic cells and a favorableprognosis) occurring at a late age in ∼20% of gene carriers and a male/femaleratio of 2:1 among affected members [6, 32] (Table 3). The pattern ofinheritance is consistent with autosomal dominant transmission with reducedpenetrance. Metastasis is less frequent, and age-dependent penetrance inmutation carriers seems to be reduced relative to penetrance in VHL syndrome [6].
HPRCC is mainly causedby activating germline mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET proto-oncogene. MET is located in 7q31 and codifies atyrosine kinase receptor that is normally activated by hepatocyte growth factor(HGF) [33] (Table 2). The MET–HGF signallingpathway is important for cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymaltransitions, branching morphogenesis, differentiation and regulation of cellmigration in many tissues. Most of the germline mutations occur within the METactivation loop or in the ATP-binding pocket and cause ligand-independent METactivation (Figure 3) [34].
Tumors from patients withpapillary RCC and germline mutations of MET commonly show trisomy of chromosome 7 when analyzed by cytogenetic studies andcomparative genomic hybridization (CGH) providing the second activating eventin the renal cells [9].
The molecular genetictesting of MET is mainly performed bysequence analysis of exons 16 to 19. All reported alterations consist in pointmutations. Ten known mutations are clustered in exons 16–19 of the tyrosine kinase domain and all are missense mutations which change the amino acid(V1110I, H1112R, H1112Y, M1149T, V1206L, V1238I, D1246N, Y1248C, Y1248D,M1268T). Mutations at four codons (V1110, D1246, Y1248, M1268) are homologousto sites of disease-associated activating mutations in other RTKs (RET, c-kit,c-erbB). Two unrelated North American families have been identified with theH1112R mutation and shared flanking genotyping data, suggesting a foundereffect. Other mutations with only weak transforming potential (Y1248C, L1213V)confer anchorage-independent growth and an invasive phenotype in transfectedcells.
Molecular genetic testing for a germline MET mutation is indicated in all individualsknown to have or suspected of having HPRCC.
There are no specificscreening guidelines for families suspected of having HPRCC. Individuals inthese families are encouraged to talk with their doctor about screening optionsfor kidney cancer, including ultrasound, and CT scan. Some clinicians suggestthat individuals who have HPRCC, or a family history that suggests HPRCC,should have yearly screening beginning at age 30.
Hereditaryleiomyomatosis renal cell cancer (HLRCC) (OMIM 605839) predisposes to multiplecutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and solitary papillary type 2 RCCs [6, 35] (Table 2).
The majority ofindividuals (76%) present with a single or multiple cutaneous leiomyoma. Theselesions appear as skin-colored to light brown papules or nodules distributedover the trunk and extremities, and occasionally on the face. Forty percent ofindividuals with HLRCC have mild cutaneous manifestations with five or fewerlesions [36]. Histologically, proliferation ofinterlacing bundles of smooth muscle fibers with centrally located longblunt-edged nuclei is observed.
Practically all femaleswith HLRCC develop uterine leiomyomas [36–38]. However, whether all women withHLRCC have a higher risk of developing uterine leiomyosarcomas is unclear. Inthe original description of HLRCC, it was reported that 15% of women withuterine leiomyomas also had uterine leiomyosarcoma [39].
Most renal tumors areunilateral and solitary. Approximately 10%–16% ofindividuals with HLRCC who present with multiple cutaneous leiomyomas had renaltumors at the time that renal imaging was performed [37, 38]. Most tumors are classified as “type2” papillary renal cancer, which display distinct papillary architecture andcharacteristic histopathology (high-grade tumors with large eosinophilic cells,an aggressive course, and a bad prognosis) [38] (Table 3). The median age atdetection of renal tumors is 44 years, and, in contrast to other hereditaryrenal cancer syndromes, renal cancers associated with HLRCC are aggressive [38].
The disease is caused bygermline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene FH located in 1q42-43 that encodes themitochondrial Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (EC4.2.1.2.) [35]. FH consists of ten exonsencompassing 22.15 kb of DNA and is highly conserved across species. The active form of the enzyme is a homotetramer and catalyzes theconversion of fumarate to L-malate. In mammals, there are two fumarase isoforms(mitochondrial and cytosolic) that are synthesized from the same mRNA. Afterinitial synthesis, the FH proteins are partially imported andprocessed at the mitochondrial outer membrane [6].
Activity of FH enzymecan be measured in cultured skin fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells to confirmthe diagnosis. Reduced activity (≤60%) of FH enzyme was found in all affected individuals with the diagnosis ofHLRCC [40, 41].
The overall risk forrenal tumor development is unclear and the mechanism of FH-mutation-driven tumorigenesis remains unknown so far [6]. It is plausible that intracellularfumarate accumulation as a result of FH inactivation causes decreasedHIF degradation and overexpression of genes more downstream in the HIF pathway [42].
						FH is the only gene known to be associated with HLRCC. Between80% and 100% of individuals with HLRCC have identifiable sequence variants in FH [36–38]. The spectrum of mutations includes missense,insertion/deletion, and nonsense mutations that are predicted to truncate theprotein, or substitute or delete highly conserved aminoacids, along withseveral whole-gene deletion. About 40 different FH mutations have been identified and are distributed throughout theentire gene without genotype-phenotypecorrelation [40]. Several of the mutations occur inmany families, which could reflect a founder effect; notably, the Arg190Hismutation, which is the most frequent mutation (33%) in a North American familystudy, and the Arg58X and Asn64Thr mutations in studies by the European-basedMultiple Leiomyoma Consortium [6].
Molecular genetic testing for a germline FH mutation is indicated in all individualsknown to have or suspected of having HLRCC, including individuals with the following:
						multiple cutaneous leiomyomas (with at least onehistologically-confirmed leiomyoma) without a family history of HLRCC;a single cutaneous leiomyoma with family history of HLRCC;one or more tubulo-papillary, collecting-duct, or papillary type 2 renaltumors with or without a family history of HLRCC.					
multiple cutaneous leiomyomas (with at least onehistologically-confirmed leiomyoma) without a family history of HLRCC;
a single cutaneous leiomyoma with family history of HLRCC;
one or more tubulo-papillary, collecting-duct, or papillary type 2 renaltumors with or without a family history of HLRCC.
Measurement of FH enzyme activity can be useful in the diagnosis of HLRCC incases with atypical presentation and undetectable FH mutations [40, 41].
No correlation isobserved between FH mutations and the occurrence of cutaneouslesions, uterine fibroids, or renal cancer of HLRCC [36]. To date, six women with a germline mutation in FH have been reportedwith uterine leiomyosarcoma [43, 44]. It seems that FH mutation-positive families are in general not highly predisposed to uterinecancer, but a few individuals and families seem to be at high risk.
HLRCC is inherited in anautosomal dominant manner. Some individuals diagnosed with HLRCC have an affected parent and some have HLRCC as the result of a de novo gene mutation. In this case, the proportion of cases caused by de novo mutations is unknown as subtle manifestation in parents has notbeen evaluated and genetic testing data are insufficient. Recommendations forevaluation of parents of a proband with a suspected de novo mutation include molecular genetic testing if the FH disease-causing mutation in the proband has been identified. However, it is important to notethat although some individuals diagnosed with HLRCC have an affected parent, the family history may appear to be negative because of failure torecognize the disorder in family members, early death of the parent before theonset of symptoms, or late onset of the disease in the affected parent.
In the case of thesiblings of a proband, the risk depends upon the genetic status of theproband's parents. If a parent of a proband is clinically affected or has a disease-causing mutation, each sibling of the proband is at a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. If the disease-causing mutation cannot be detectedin the DNA of either parent, the risk to siblings is low, but greaterthan that of the general population because the possibility of germline mosaicism exists [38].
The risk to other familymembers depends upon the status of the proband's parents. If a parent is foundto be affected or to have a disease-causingmutation, his or her family members are at risk.
It is not possible to predict whether symptoms will occur, or if they do,what the age of onset, severity, and type of symptoms, or rate of diseaseprogression will be in individuals who have a disease-causing mutation.
When neither parent of a proband with an autosomal dominant condition has the disease-causingmutation or clinical evidence of the disorder, it is likely that the proband has a de novomutation. However, possible nonmedical explanations including alternate paternity or undisclosed adoption could also beexplored.
There is no consensus onclinical surveillance for HLRCC individuals so far but the following provisionalrecommendations have been accepted until a consensus conference is conducted [31].
Individuals with theclinical diagnosis of HLRCC, individuals with heterozygous mutations in FH without clinical manifestations, and at-riskfamily members who have not undergone molecular genetic testing should have the following regularsurveillance by physicians familiar with the clinical manifestations of HLRCC.
															Skin. Full skin examination is recommended annuallyto every two years to assess the extent of disease and to evaluate for changessuggestive of leiomyosarcoma.									Uterus. Annual gynecologic consultation is recommendedto assess severity of uterine fibroids and to evaluate for changes suggestiveof leiomyosarcoma.									Kidneys. If both the initial (baseline) and the firstannual follow-up abdominal CT scan with contrast are normal, this evaluationshould be repeated every two years.

PET-CTmay be added to identify metabolically active lesions suggesting possiblemalignant growth. It must be taken into consideration that ultrasoundexamination alone is never sufficient.
Renal tumors should beevaluated by a urologic oncology surgeon familiar with the renal cancer ofHLRCC.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome  (OMIM 135150) is a genodermatosis thatpredisposes individuals to benign cutaneous lesions of the face and neck, spontaneousrecurrent pneumothorax and/or lung cysts, and renal tumors [6, 7]. Approximately 15–29% ofindividuals with BHD syndrome have renal tumors [45, 46] (Table 3). The renal tumors areusually bilateral and multifocal. Tumor types include renal oncocytoma,chromophobe RCC, oncocytic hybrid tumor, and a minority of clear cell RCC [47]. The most common tumors are ahybrid of oncocytoma and chromophobe histologic cell types, so-called oncocytichybrid tumor (67%), chromophobe RCC (23%), and renal oncocytoma (3%). Onlyrenal oncocytoma is considered a benign tumor [48]. Other types of renal tumorsreported in lower frequency include clear cell RCC and papillary renalcarcinoma. Most renal tumors are slow-growing. Median age of diagnosis is 48years with range from 31 to 71 years [46].
The disease is caused bygermline mutations in the BHD (FLCN) gene on chromosome 17p11.2 [49]. BHD encodes folliculin, a new protein with unknown function but it is highly expressed in a variety of tissues including skinand skin appendages, type 1 pneumocytes, and distal nephrons of the kidney [50]. Recent studies suggest thatfolliculin might be involved in energy and/or nutrient sensing through the AMPKand mTOR signaling pathways [51].
						BHD somaticmutations are very rare in sporadic RCC but hypermethylations are encountered in ∼30% of all RCChistological types [52]. Germline mutations in BHD,plus somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity in tumor tissue, suggest that lossof function of the folliculin protein is the basis of tumor formation inBHD syndrome [53].
						BHD is the only gene known to be associated with BHDsyndrome. Various mutations have been identified in familieswith BHD syndrome. All mutations predict protein truncation. The most common mutation is cytosine insertion or deletion, which occurs in a polycytosinetract in exon 11, suggesting the presence of ahypermutable hot spot [46, 47]. Fifty-three percent of familieswith BHD syndrome have been found to have an insertion or deletion in the polycytosine tract in exon 11 (mutational hot spot) [46]. Sequence analysis of all coding exons (exon 4–14) increases the mutation detection in probands to 84% [46].
Molecular genetic testing is indicated in all individualsknown to have or suspected of having BHD syndrome including individuals withthe following.
						Five or more facial ortruncal papules with at least one histologically confirmed fibrofolliculoma [54] with or without family history of BHD.A family history of BHD syndrome with a singlefibrofolliculoma or a single renal tumor or history of spontaneous pneumothorax.Multiple and bilateralchromophobe, oncocytic, and/or oncocytic hydrid renal tumors.A single oncocytic,chromophobe, or oncocytic-hydrid tumor and a family history of renal cancer with any of the aboverenal cell tumor types.A family history of autosomal dominant primary spontaneous pneumothoraxwithout a history of chronic obstructivepulmonary disease.

Mutations in BHD were found infamilies with dominantly inherited spontaneous pneumothorax. Pulmonaryinvolvement appears to be the only manifestation; penetrance is 100% [55, 56].
Acquired mutations in BHD have been identifiedin sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinoma [52, 57] and colon cancer [58, 59] without other associated tumorscharacteristic of the heritable disease.
No correlation is observed between type of BHD mutation and pulmonary and cutaneousmanifestations. However, individuals who have a deletion in the polycytosine tract of exon 11 may have a lower risk ofdeveloping renal cancers than individuals with other mutations [46].
BHD syndrome isinherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some individuals with BHDsyndrome have an affected parent and some have BHD syndromeas a result of a de novo gene mutation. The proportion of cases caused by denovo mutations is unknown as a sufficient numberof parents have not been evaluated for subtle manifestations, nor are theresufficient data on clinically unaffected parents who have been evaluated by molecular genetic testing. Recommendations for the evaluationof parents of a proband with a suspected de novo mutation include molecular genetic testing if the disease-causing mutation inthe BHD gene in the proband is identified. But, although someindividuals diagnosed with BHD syndrome have an affected parent, the family history may appear to be negative becauseof failure to recognize the disorder in family members, early death of theparent before the onset of symptoms, or late onset of the disease in the affected parent.
The risk to the siblingsof the proband depends upon the genetic status ofthe proband's parents. If a parent of a proband is clinically affected or has a disease-causing mutation,the sibs of the proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting themutation. If neither parent has the disease-causing mutation identified in the proband, the risk to sibs is low, butgreater than that of the general population because the possibility of germline mosaicism exists.
When neither parent of a proband with an autosomal dominant condition has the disease-causingmutation or clinical evidence of the disorder, it is likely that the proband has a de novomutation. However, other possible nonmedical explanationscould also be explored.
There is no consensus onclinical surveillance; therefore, these recommendations are provisional until aconsensus conference is conducted.
Individuals with known BHDsyndrome, individuals known to have disease-causing mutations in BHD withoutclinical manifestation, and at-risk family members who have not undergonegenetic testing should have regular monitoring by physicians familiar with thespectrum of BHD syndrome. In particular, surveillance for and monitoring ofrenal tumors include the following:
						if normal at baseline, abdominal/pelvic CT scan with contrast every twoyears;if any suspicious lesion (indeterminate lesion, questionable or complexcysts) at previous examination, annual abdominal/pelvic CT scan with contrastalternating every other year with MRI to reduce lifetime exposure to radiation;evaluation of renal tumors by a urologic surgeon;monitoring of tumors less than three centimeters in diameter by periodicimaging; they may not require surgical intervention while this small.

The identification ofgenes responsible for inherited RCC has resulted in a better understanding ofrenal tumorigenesis including sporadic RCC and is paving the way for newtherapeutic approaches [6, 7]. For VHL, recent and ongoinginsights into the functions of the VHL gene, especially the HIF-ubiquitylation pathway,provide an attractive molecular basis for the development of specificinhibitors of HIF and/or its downstream targets [13]. Preliminary studies with the VEGF receptorinhibitor SU5416 showed that at least a third of patients with advanced VHLdisease improved their clinical status giving promising expectations [60]. In same directions, new proteinkinase receptor inhibitors are emerging [9]. In HPRCC, MET inhibitors gaveencouraging results in in vitrostudies, but clinical trials have started very recently and although data onthe antitumor activity of the anti-MET compounds are not yet available, thesestudies have shown that MET inhibition results in low-grade toxicity, inagreement with the preclinical analyses performed in animal models [61, 62].
Recent studies suggestthat HIF overexpression is involved in HLRCC tumorigenesis [42, 63]. Therefore, future target therapiesfor HLRCC-associated tumors may include, for example, anti-HIF therapies suchas R59949 that regulate prolyl hydroxylase activity, thus preventing HIFaccumulation.
The study of familieswith increased rates of cancer will continue to yield more insight into thefactors that increase cancer risk. Genetic predisposition in the form ofmutations and polymorphisms will increasingly be catalogued and DNA-levelgenetic profiling of high-risk families and individuals will becomecommonplace. The increase in availability of genetic testing and counseling forhigh-risk families should prove both helpful and cost-effective, as geneticallyunaffected family members reassured regarding their health status and removedfrom lifelong follow-up screening programmes.
Finally, we also shouldkeep in mind, although not deeply discussed in this review, the psychological andethical implications of the genetic counseling [64–66], not only from the strictly clinicalpoint of view, but also regarding the management of personal geneticinformation that could have an impact on the individual and their relatives fromcertain health insurance companies.
