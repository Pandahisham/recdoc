Workshop on perinatal exposure to dioxin-like compounds. I. Summary.

An international workshop reviewed 20 ongoing or recently completed studies of the effects of perinatal exposures to dioxins, dibenzofurans, and PCBs on the reproductive, endocrine, neurodevelopmental, and immune systems. Many of the observed effects are consistent with these compounds acting as "environmental hormones" or endocrine disrupters. This report summarizes the conclusions and future directions described at the workshop.
