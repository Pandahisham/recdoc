Selective and Specific Inhibition of If                    with Ivabradine for the Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease or Heart                    Failure

Heart rate is an important contributor in the pathophysiology of both coronary                    artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). Ivabradine is an anti-anginal and                    anti-ischaemic agent, which selectively and specifically inhibits the                        If current in the sino-atrial node and provides                    pure heart rate reduction without altering other cardiac parameters, including                    conduction, and without directly affecting other haemodynamic parameters. It is                    approved for the treatment of CAD and HF. This article summarises the                    pharmacological properties, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and tolerability                    of ivabradine in the treatment of CAD and HF, and presents evidence                    demonstrating that the pharmacological and clinical properties and clinical                    efficacy of ivabradine make it an important therapeutic choice for patients with                    stable CAD or HF. The positive effect of ivabradine on angina pectoris symptoms                    and its ability to reduce myocardial ischemia make it an important agent in the                    management of patients with stable CAD or chronic HF. Further studies are                    underway to add to the already robust evidence of ivabradine for the prevention                    of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD but without clinical HF. The                    SIGNIFY (Study assessInG the morbidity–mortality beNefits of the                        If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with                    coronarY artery disease) trial includes patients with stable CAD and an LVEF                    above 40 %, with no clinical sign of HF, and is investigating the                    long-term effects (over a period of 48 months) of ivabradine in a large                    study population. So far, this study has included more than 19,000 patients from                    51 countries.

Although considerable progress has been made in the management and outcome of                patients with cardiovascular disease, important challenges remain. Coronary artery                disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF) are leading causes of death and disability                despite advances in the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Cardiovascular                disease, including CAD and HF, represents a huge public health problem globally.                Over the next several decades, the prevalence of both CAD and HF is expected to                increase, mostly because of an aging population and better survival after acute                coronary events [1].
Heart rate is an important contributor in the pathophysiology of both CAD and HF and                is being increasingly recognised as a modifiable risk factor in patients with                cardiovascular disease [2–5]. There are many mechanisms through which an                elevated heart rate might directly affect cardiovascular risk, including increased                myocardial oxygen demand, energy depletion, accelerated atherosclerosis, and                increased risk of plaque rupture [6]. This                makes reduction of heart rate an important therapeutic target in patients with CAD                and/or HF. Ivabradine is the first member of a new group of drugs, the specific                heart rate-lowering agents, to be introduced into clinical use. Ivabradine acts by                selectively inhibiting the ionic current If, which                modulates pacemaker activity in the sino-atrial node, providing pure heart rate                reduction [7].
This article summarises the pharmacological properties, pharmacokinetics, clinical                efficacy and tolerability of ivabradine in the treatment of CAD and HF.
Heart rate is normally determined by the rate of spontaneous diastolic depolarization                of myocytes in the sino-atrial node [8]. The                spontaneous slow diastolic depolarization drives membrane potential towards a                threshold that triggers an action potential. The rate of spontaneous diastolic                depolarization is significantly influenced by If, a                mixed sodium–potassium current involving ion movement across so-called                f-channels, which are activated by hyperpolarization, and the opening of which is                dependent on the intracellular availability of cyclic adenosine monophosphate [8].
Ivabradine directly and selectively inhibits the If                current, reducing diastolic depolarization rate and heart rate (Fig. 1) [9–11]. Ivabradine enters                and blocks the channel from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, preferentially                when the channel is in the open state [10].                As a result of this use-dependent inhibition, the reduction in the rate of pacemaker                activity induced by ivabradine must be more important at a higher firing rate, as                has already been suggested [10, 12, 13].Fig. 1Mode of action of ivabradine: by inhibiting ion flow though the                            f-channel, ivabradine reduces the slow diastolic depolarization phase of                            the action potential of sino-atrial node cells, thereby reducing heart                            rate.

The selective binding of ivabradine to If channels makes                it a pure heart-rate–reducing agent. The specificity of ivabradine for the                    If current ensures that ivabradine has no direct                effects on myocardial contractility (or relaxation), ventricular repolarization or                intracardiac conduction [14, 15]. The mode of action of ivabradine allows                the drug’s effect to be enhanced when necessary in clinical practice without                affecting other aspects of cardiac function and with only a minor risk                (1–4 %) of excessive bradycardia. Some, but not all, computational                models show that ivabradine doses sufficient to cause near-complete                    If inhibition can reduce heart rate substantially                without abolishing spontaneous diastolic depolarization and associated action                potentials [16–18]. In vitro studies have confirmed that full                    If block cannot occur in a clinical setting with                ivabradine, because at therapeutic concentrations, If                block is less than 50 % [9, 10].
The reduction of heart rate by ivabradine has been characterised in several human                    studies involving healthy volunteers and patients, and in several pooled                    analyses of data from multiple studies [19–21]. These                    studies have shown that the heart rate reduction with ivabradine is dependent on                    dose and baseline heart rate.
Treatment with ivabradine was associated with a decrease in 24-h heart rate of                    6.3 ± 9.5 beats per minute (bpm) at last                    assessment versus no change with placebo                    (0.4 ± 7.2 bpm,                        p < 0.001) in a                    6-month Holter substudy of the BEAUTIFUL (morBidity-mortality EvAlUaTion of the                        If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with                    coronary disease and left-ventricULar dysfunction) trial, which examined the                    cardiac safety of ivabradine in patients with stable CAD and left ventricular                    systolic dysfunction (LVSD) [22]. The                    decrease in waking heart rate with ivabradine was greater than the decrease in                    heart rate during sleep (6.8 ± 10.4 versus                    5.2 ± 8.9 bpm at last visit).
Another recent study in 23 healthy volunteers (aged 19–63 years)                    evaluated the effect of ivabradine 7.5 mg twice daily on heart rate over                    24 h and demonstrated a significant reduction in heart rate through                    24 h, while maintaining the circadian heart rate pattern (Clinical data                    from IRIS, EudraCT number: 2011-001665-40; data on file) (Fig. 2). The INITIATIVE (INternatIonal TrIal of                    the AnTi-anginal effects of IVabradinE compared to atenolol) trial, involving                    939 patients with stable angina, showed that ivabradine significantly reduced                    heart rate after 1 and 4 months of treatment, at rest and at peak                    exercise [23]. At rest, heart rate was                    reduced by 14.3 bpm in the ivabradine 7.5 mg twice daily group                    compared with 15.6 bpm in the atenolol 100 mg once daily                        group.Fig. 2Change from baseline in mean heart rate over 24 h after                                treatment with ivabradine 7.5 mg twice daily in volunteers.                                    bpm beats per minute.

Heart rate reduction with ivabradine in stable angina patients was maintained                    with long-term treatment in a randomized, double-blind study in 386 patients                    treated with ivabradine (either 5 or 7.5 mg twice daily) for                    1 year [24]. Both doses of                    ivabradine were associated with a substantial reduction in resting heart rate:                    10 bpm with ivabradine 5 mg twice daily (from 71 to                    62 bpm) and 12 bpm with ivabradine 7.5 mg twice daily                    (from 71 to 59 bpm) [24].
The dependence of If inhibition with ivabradine on                    baseline heart rate suggests that heart rate slowing should be greatest in                    patients with the highest pre-treatment heart rate. This was corroborated by                    data in 2,351 patients, which showed that the magnitude of heart rate reduction                    was directly related to baseline heart rate, for each dose of ivabradine [16].
By reducing heart rate, ivabradine reduces myocardial oxygen demand. It also                    maximizes oxygen supply and myocardial perfusion by prolonging diastolic time                    and by enabling coronary vasodilation during exercise [25, 26]. In                    contrast, β-blockers tend to prolong systole because of their negative                    effect on myocardial contractility. In consequence, diastole is shorter with                    β-blockers than with ivabradine at rest and during exercise for a                    similar heart rate reduction [25, 26].
Adequate relaxation of left ventricular (LV) myocardium after systolic                    contraction is important in facilitating diastolic LV filling, particularly                    during exercise. Though it caused similar reductions in heart rate at rest and                    during exercise to those achieved by atenolol in an animal model, ivabradine did                    not alter the relaxation time constant at rest or during exercise, and gave                    results similar to the saline control [27]. Furthermore, despite a similar effect on heart rate,                    β-blockade resulted in constriction of large and small coronary arteries                    during exercise, while vasodilation was not affected by ivabradine [28]. Ivabradine also significantly reduces                    cardiac energy consumption and preserves redox potentials during ischaemia by                    reducing heart rate [29].
In a preclinical setting, ivabradine has been shown to improve regional ischaemia                    to a greater extent than the β-blocker propranolol. In an animal model                    simulating stable angina pectoris, ivabradine and propranolol (both at doses                    producing similar reductions in heart rate) reduced exercise-associated                    ST-segment shift in the ischaemic region by approximately 80 %, but                    ivabradine preserved systolic shortening to a significantly greater degree than                    propranolol (p < 0.05)                        [30].
Ivabradine has been shown to improve myocardial stunning in dogs [31, 32]. When therapy was administered before the ischaemic insult,                    atenolol and ivabradine both reduced post-ischaemic stunning compared with                    saline control, by reducing the degree of exercise-induced ischaemia [32]. However, when administered soon after                    the ischaemic insult with part of the myocardium in the stunned state,                    ivabradine improved myocardial contractility, but because of its negative                    inotropic action, atenolol significantly exacerbated contractile dysfunction                        [32].
The effect of ivabradine in acute myocardial infarction (MI) has also been                    explored [33]. Acute MI was modelled by                    hypoperfusing the myocardial region supplied by the left anterior descending                    coronary artery for 90 min and then reperfusing for 120 min.                    Intravenous ivabradine 0.6 mg/kg, administered before the ischemic                    episode, reduced the size of the resulting infarct from 35 % of the area                    at risk in saline controls to 19 %. Ivabradine also reduced infarct size                    when given after the onset of ischemia or just before reperfusion. When given                    15–20 min after the onset of ischemia, ivabradine also improved regional                    blood flow and systolic wall thickening [33].
Several studies have investigated the longer-term effects of ivabradine on                    myocardial structure and function in models of HF after induction of                    experimental MI [34–36]. These studies have highlighted the                    potential of ivabradine to prevent negative cardiac effects following MI.                    Ivabradine, given 7 days after MI in a rat model, decreased heart rate                    over 90 days without any other haemodynamic effects [36]. Cardiac output was preserved because                    of increased stroke volume. In addition, ivabradine improved cardiac function by                    significantly decreasing left ventricular systolic diameter and increasing                    fractional shortening [36]. Similar                    cardiac benefits were also observed when ivabradine was given immediately after                    MI [34] or 2 months after MI                        [35].
Assessment of the effects of ivabradine on the global cardiac remodelling process                    in HF showed that it had beneficial effects on LV remodelling [37, 38]. Non-clinical data showed that ivabradine reduced fibrosis in                    surviving myocardium, and decreased circulating, as well as local,                    renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) stimulation [34]. In another study in a model of severe                    HF in rats, treatment with ivabradine for 3 months improved left                    ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and end-diastolic pressure, and reduced                    interstitial fibrosis in the non-infarcted LV region [35]. Another study comparing ivabradine and metoprolol for                    the prevention of experimental HF in hypertensive mice found that treatment with                    ivabradine led to a significant improvement in systolic and diastolic LV                    function, which was associated with less cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis,                    inflammation and cardiac apoptosis [39].                    Although both drugs reduced heart rate similarly and only metoprolol reduced                    systolic blood pressure, metoprolol did not prevent deterioration in cardiac                    function and adverse remodelling, despite a reduction of the inflammatory stress                    response [39].
Endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in various cardiovascular diseases,                    including CAD and congestive HF. In experimental studies, ivabradine has been                    shown to protect endothelial function. Treatment with ivabradine for                    3 months prevented deterioration of endothelium-dependent vasodilation                    in the renal and cerebral arteries in dyslipidaemic mice [40]. The protective effect seen with ivabradine was not                    fully reproduced in mice receiving metoprolol, despite a similar heart rate                    reduction. This was possibly due to inhibition of                    β-adrenoceptor-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase                        [40].
Ivabradine also reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in transgenic mice                    models of atherosclerosis. In transgenic mice with severe hypercholesterolaemia                    and atherosclerotic plaques, ivabradine reduced the atherosclerotic plaque area                    in the aortic root (by >40 %) and ascending aorta (by                    >70 %) [41].
Aortic compliance was preserved in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice                    treated with ivabradine for 6 weeks [42]. This improvement could be due to an effect on the local RAAS                    system, attenuation of oxidative stress or modulation of inflammatory cytokine                    expression [42]. Irregular shear and                    mechanical stress, which are associated with elevated heart rate, might damage                    vascular endothelium, leading to dysfunction and atherogenesis [43].
Ivabradine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over an oral dose range of                0.5–24 mg, with rapid absorption after administration of a single                oral dose [44]. In fasting conditions, the                time to peak drug concentration is approximately 1 h, with an absolute                bioavailability of the film-coated tablets of around 40 % following                gastrointestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism [44]. In fed conditions, the time to peak plasma drug concentration is                prolonged by approximately 1 h and the plasma concentration of ivabradine is                increased by 20–30 %.
Approximately 70 % of ivabradine is plasma protein bound. At steady state,                after multiple doses of 5 mg twice daily, the maximum plasma concentration                of ivabradine is 22 ng/mL and the mean plasma concentration is                10 ng/mL. Ivabradine has a half-life of 2 h in plasma and an                effective half-life of 11 h. Renal clearance of ivabradine is                70 mL/min, and the total clearance is 400 mL/min. After oral                administration, approximately 4 % of the ivabradine dose is excreted                unchanged in urine.
Compared with younger individuals, no appreciable differences in the pharmacokinetic                profile of ivabradine were observed in the elderly (aged ≥65 years)                or very elderly (≥75 years). Renal impairment (creatinine clearance                15–60 mL/min) has a minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of both                ivabradine and its main metabolite, as renal clearance accounts for a small part                (20 %) of the elimination of both products.
As regards hepatic impairment and ivabradine, patients with mild hepatic impairment                require no dose adjustment. Caution is advocated when treating patients with                moderate hepatic impairment, and ivabradine is contraindicated in patients with                severe hepatic insufficiency (as a substantial increase in systemic exposure is                predicted) [44].
Ivabradine is extensively metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP3A4. It                is a very weak inhibitor of this enzyme and has no apparent influence on the                metabolism and plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 substrates. Conversely, CYP3A4                inhibitors and agonists have been shown to affect ivabradine plasma concentrations,                so the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ivabradine is                contraindicated. Proton pump inhibitors, sildenafil, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA                (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, digoxin                and warfarin have not demonstrated any clinically significant effect on the                pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ivabradine in drug–drug interaction                studies [44].
The anti-anginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of ivabradine has been confirmed in                    patients with stable angina in clinical studies comparing it either with placebo                    or with standard anti-anginal agents (Table 1).Table 1Summary of the principal results of the main publications of                                ivabradine in coronary artery diseasePublicationStudy summaryCAD: monotherapy Borer et al., 2003 [19]                                            (n = 360)Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,                                        multicentre study in patients with stable CAD and chronic                                        stable angina                                        (n = 360).

In a placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-ranging study conducted in 360                        patients with stable CAD and chronic stable angina, Borer et al. [19] showed that ivabradine produced                        dose-dependent improvements in exercise tolerance parameters. At                        2 weeks, ivabradine 5 and 10 mg twice daily significantly                        improved the time to 1-mm ST-segment depression compared with placebo (by                        44.1 and 46.2 vs 9.0 s,                            p = 0.016). This                        reduction in angina and ischemia was associated with significant reductions                        in rate-pressure product at peak exercise                            (p = 0.011) and                        increases in total work performed in an exercise tolerance test [ETT]                            (p = 0.019) among                        ivabradine-treated patients; both changes showed significant dose-dependence                            (p = 0.002 for both)                            [19]. Furthermore, in the                        open-label extension phase (2–3 months) of this study,                        ivabradine reduced angina attacks from 4.14 to 0.95 attacks per week                            (p < 0.001) and consumption of                        short-acting nitrates from 2.28 to 0.50 U per week                            (p < 0.001) [19].
Ivabradine was compared directly with the β-blocker atenolol in                        INITIATIVE, a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 939                        patients [23]. After                        16 weeks of treatment, patients receiving ivabradine 7.5 or                        10 mg twice daily or atenolol 100 mg/day had similar                        increases in total exercise duration at trough (+86.8 and +91.7 vs                        78.8 s,                        p < 0.001 for                        non-inferiority) and the number of angina attacks per week (−2.2 and                        −2.3 vs −2.7 attacks per week) [23]. Even though ivabradine was non-inferior, after                        4 months of treatment, all ETT parameters (time to limiting angina,                        time to angina onset, and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression) tended to have                        improved more with ivabradine than with atenolol, resulting in a                        significantly greater increase in exercise capacity per beat reduction in                        heart rate with ivabradine than with atenolol. Heart rate was reduced by                        14.3 and 14.3 bpm with ivabradine 7.5 and 10 mg twice daily,                        versus 15.6 bpm with atenolol [23].
The anti-anginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of ivabradine (7.5 and                        10 mg twice daily) has been compared with amlodipine 10 mg                        daily in a large multicentre, international, double-blind, randomized,                        parallel-group trial in 1,195 patients with stable angina [45]. In this study, ivabradine was not                        inferior to amlodipine in improving exercise tolerance as well as increasing                        time to angina onset, time to limiting angina and time to 1-mm ST-segment                        depression. Similarly, ivabradine was not inferior to amlodipine in                        preventing angina attacks and limiting nitrate use; however, ivabradine                        produced a greater reduction of rate-pressure product (a surrogate for                        myocardial oxygen consumption) than amlodipine.
Skalidis et al. [46] assessed                        the effect of ivabradine (5 mg twice daily) on coronary blood flow                        velocity and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with stable CAD                            (n = 21). Coronary                        blood flow was assessed invasively using intracoronary Doppler measurements                        at baseline and after 1 week of ivabradine treatment. This study                        showed that ivabradine significantly reduced heart rate and improved                        hyperaemic and resting coronary flow velocity and CFR in these patients                        after 1 week of treatment. These results suggested that in addition                        to ivabradine having anti-ischaemic effects in patients with CAD (as                        previously shown), it may also have an impact on ischaemic events, as CFR                        predicts adverse cardiovascular long-term outcomes [47].
Ivabradine has been shown to provide additional anti-ischaemic efficacy in                        patients who are already receiving standard therapy with β-blockers                            [48–50]. The double-blind, randomized,                        multicentre, placebo-controlled ASSOCIATE (evaluation of the Antianginal                        efficacy and Safety of the aSsociation Of the If                        Current Inhibitor ivAbradine with a beTa-blockEr) trial was conducted in 889                        patients with stable angina already receiving atenolol [48]. All included patients had a                        positive symptom-limited exercise test while receiving atenolol                        50 mg once daily. These patients were randomized to receive either                        ivabradine 5 mg twice daily for 2 months, which was then                        increased to 7.5 mg twice daily for an additional 2 months                        (449 patients), or placebo (440 patients) and underwent exercise testing at                        the trough of drug activity at 2 and 4 months. In the ivabradine                        group, heart rate decreased by 7 bpm during the first                        2 months of treatment with 5 mg twice daily and by                        9 bpm with ivabradine 7.5 mg twice daily. Ivabradine                        significantly increased the total exercise duration as well as all other                        exercise test criteria such as time to limiting angina, time to angina onset                        and time to 1 mm ST-segment depression                            (p < 0.001)                        compared with placebo (Fig. 3) [48]. Significant                        improvements were seen with ivabradine 5 mg twice daily after                        2 months of treatment but were more pronounced after up-titration to                        7.5 mg twice daily. The treatment with ivabradine was well                        tolerated, and 90 % of patients were up-titrated to 7.5 mg                        twice daily after the first 2 months. This study clearly                        demonstrated that ivabradine treatment in patients with stable angina                        receiving the β-blocker atenolol resulted in a significant long-term                        improvement in total exercise duration in standardized Bruce protocol                        exercise testing. A recent analysis of this study extended these findings                        and demonstrated that ivabradine treatment resulted in improvements in all                        ETT criteria relative to placebo in patients with stable angina pectoris                        with resting heart rates above and below 65 bpm [51].Fig. 3Results of the ASSOCIATE study showing the effects of ivabradine                                    on exercise tolerance testing (ETT) after 4 months of                                    treatment in patients with chronic stable angina who received                                    the β-blocker atenolol.

Results of the ASSOCIATE study showing the effects of ivabradine                                    on exercise tolerance testing (ETT) after 4 months of                                    treatment in patients with chronic stable angina who received                                    the β-blocker atenolol. Adapted from Tardif et al.                                        [48]
A pilot study compared the anti-anginal and anti-ischemic efficacy and                        tolerability of ivabradine (7.5 mg twice daily) in combination with                        the β-blocker bisoprolol (5 mg once daily) versus bisoprolol                        10 mg/day in 29 patients with stable angina [49]. After 2 months of therapy, the mean                        resting heart rate decreased similarly in both groups (from 76.6 to                        59.3 bpm                        [p < 0.001] vs                        from 75.9 to 60.5 bpm                        [p = 0.002]). However,                        addition of ivabradine was more efficient for improvement of exercise                        capacity, as shown by the results of the 6-min walking test (from 388 to                        446 m                        [p < 0.001] vs                        from 386 to 400 m) and an ETT (workload increased from 5.9 to 7.0                        metabolic equivalents with ivabradine + bisoprolol,                            p = 0.004, vs 5.7 to                        6.2 metabolic equivalents with bisoprolol alone,                            p = 0.141). Because of                        the small size of the study, its results should be viewed with caution and                        as hypothesis generating in nature. Nevertheless, they do suggest that the                        combination of ivabradine and a β-blocker is preferable to treatment                        with a β-blocker alone in patients with stable angina [49].
The non-interventional, multicentre, open-label ADDITIONS (prActical Daily                        efficacy anD safety of procoralan In combinaTION with beta blockerS) trial                        followed 2,330 German patients with stable angina pectoris receiving                        β-blockers who initiated treatment with ivabradine                        5–7.5 mg twice daily [50]. This study demonstrated that adding ivabradine to standard                        therapy with a β-blocker significantly reduced heart rate (from 85                        to 65.6 bpm after 4 months), the number of angina attacks                        per week (from 1.7 attacks to 0.3 attacks per week) and nitrate consumption                        (from 2.3 to 0.4 U per week) over 4 months of treatment (all                            p < 0.0001)                            [50].
Finally, the results of a long-term trial investigating the efficacy and                        tolerability of add-on ivabradine demonstrated that the initial efficacy                        observed with ivabradine is maintained over a longer period of time                        (12 months) in patients with chronic stable angina receiving                        concomitant therapy with anti-anginal therapies such as long-acting                        nitrates, molsidomine, nicorandil, trimetazidine or dihydropyridine                        calcium-channel blockers [24]. In                        both ivabradine treatment groups, there was a significant reduction in                        resting heart rate (from 72.4 to 62.7 bpm and from 71.8 to                        59.4 bpm with ivabradine 5 and 7.5 mg twice daily).                        Furthermore, the mean number of angina attacks per week decreased                        significantly by more than 50 % after 12 months’                        treatment with ivabradine                            (p < 0.001),                        and more than 80 % of patients had no attacks or only one angina                        attack per week after 12 month of therapy (compared with                        58 % of patients at baseline) [24].
Combination therapy is widely used in clinical practice in order to achieve                        adequate control of angina, and the majority of patients receive two or more                        anti-anginal drugs. However, clinical trials evaluating combination therapy                        have yielded inconsistent results [52–55]. Most                        studies have been small, and many have not shown significant benefits with                        combinations as opposed to single-drug therapy. The ASSOCIATE study has                        demonstrated that addition of ivabradine to β-blockers provides                        further clinical benefits, and this might be considered one of the best                        evidence-based combination therapies for angina patients. Furthermore, the                        ADDITIONS study confirmed that combining ivabradine with β-blocker                        therapy was efficient and well tolerated in everyday clinical practice.
The proven anti-anginal and anti-ischemic efficacy of ivabradine has led to                        its approval for the treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris in                        normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate >60 bpm who are                        inadequately controlled with an optimal dose of β-blocker or who are                        unable to tolerate β-blockers, or for whom the use of                        β-blockers is contraindicated.
Ivabradine provides anti-anginal efficacy in a wide range of patients,                        including elderly patients [56] or                        those with concomitant diseases [21]                        such as diabetes [57]. An analysis                        of the REDUCTION (Reduction of ischaemic Events by reDUCtion of hearT rate                        In the treatment Of stable aNgina with ivabradine) study showed that                        ivabradine was effective in patients older than 80 years of age                            [56]. This open-label,                        multicentre, non-interventional subanalysis of 382 patients with stable                        angina pectoris receiving ivabradine showed that ivabradine therapy over                        4 months significantly reduced angina pectoris episodes (from 3.0 to                        0.8 per week), heart rate (from 83.0 to 71.0 bpm) and the                        consumption of short-acting nitrates (from 4.2 to 1.2 U per week)                        [all p < 0.0001 vs                        baseline] [56, 58].
Furthermore, ivabradine is effective in subpopulations of patients with                        stable angina pectoris and various concomitant diseases [21]. In a pooled analysis of five                        randomized studies investigating the efficacy of ivabradine in patients with                        angina (n = 2,425), the                        anti-anginal efficacy of ivabradine was similar across a range of                        subpopulations (51–70 % reduction in the frequency of angina                        attacks in subpopulations, divided by age, gender, angina severity, disease                        characteristics and comorbidities). The efficacy of ivabradine was                        maintained in the presence of different comorbidities: no difference in                        efficacy was observed in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive                        pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease.
These findings are further supported by an analysis of the effect of                        ivabradine in 535 patients with stable angina and diabetes [57]. The heart rate reduction and                        anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal effects seen with ivabradine, as evaluated                        by ETTs, were similar in patients with and without diabetes mellitus [57]. Ivabradine treatment was not                        associated with adverse effects on glucose metabolism.
The BEAUTIFUL study investigated the prognostic effects of adding ivabradine to                    standard treatment [59, 60]. This randomized, double-blind,                    placebo-controlled study was conducted in patients with CAD and an LVEF of                    <40 %                    (n = 10,917) randomized to                    receive ivabradine 5–7.5 mg twice daily or placebo on top of                    conventional cardiovascular treatment as recommended by guidelines. In                    BEAUTIFUL, the composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, admission to                    hospital for acute MI and admission to hospital for new-onset or worsening HF in                    the ivabradine group was similar to that in the placebo group. In discussing the                    BEAUTIFUL results, the investigators underlined that heart rate in the total                    population was low at baseline (72 bpm), leading to insufficient heart                    rate reduction with ivabradine (5.6 bpm of reduction corrected for                    placebo) and therefore limiting the impact of ivabradine on the primary                    composite endpoint. However, in a pre-specified subgroup of patients with an                    elevated heart rate (≥70 bpm), ivabradine reduced the rate of                    admission to hospital for fatal or non-fatal MI by 36 % (hazard ratio                    [HR] 0.64, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.49–0.84,                        p = 0.001;                        Fig. 4) and coronary                    revascularization by 30 % (HR 0.70, 95 % CI 0.52–0.93,                        p = 0.016) [59].Fig. 4Effect of ivabradine on risk of hospitalization for myocardial                                infarction (MI) in patients with coronary artery disease with left                                ventricular systolic dysfunction and a heart rate ≥70 beats                                per minute (bpm) in the BEAUTIFUL trial.

Effect of ivabradine on risk of hospitalization for myocardial                                infarction (MI) in patients with coronary artery disease with left                                ventricular systolic dysfunction and a heart rate ≥70 beats                                per minute (bpm) in the BEAUTIFUL trial. HR hazard                                ratio. Adapted from Fox et al. [59]
A post hoc analysis of the trial in patients whose limiting symptom at baseline                    was angina (n = 1,507) showed                    that ivabradine reduced the primary composite endpoint by 24 % (HR 0.76,                    95 % CI 0.58–1.00,                    p = 0.05) and reduced the                    rates of hospitalization for MI by 42 % (HR 0.58, 95 % CI                    0.37–0.92, p = 0.021)                        [61].
The echo cardiographic substudy of the BEAUTIFUL trial in 590 patients showed                    that 12 months of therapy with ivabradine significantly improved LV                    end-systolic volume index [LVESVI] (−1.48 vs                        +1.85 mL/m2 with placebo,                        p = 0.018) and LVEF                    (+2 % vs no change,                    p = 0.009). This reduction in                    LVESVI was related to the degree of heart rate reduction with ivabradine [62].
The non-interventional, multicentre, open-label ADDITIONS trial also investigated                    the effects of adding ivabradine to standard therapy with β-blockers on                    quality of life [50]. The results of                    this study highlighted that not only did the addition of ivabradine have                    significant anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy (as previously discussed)                    but it was also associated with an improvement in quality of life, as assessed                    using EQ-5D index scores (+0.17,                        p < 0.001) [50]. This improvement in EQ-5D index                    scores correlated well with the results of the EQ-5D visual analogue scale                    (VAS), for which the general health status throughout the 4 months of                    treatment improved with ivabradine (VAS 57.4 ± 18.3                    points at visit 1, 65.6 ± 16.0 points at visit 2 and                    72.7 ± 15.4 at visit 3).
In the first quarter of 2012, ivabradine was approved by the European Medicines                    Agency for the treatment of chronic HF, on the basis of the results of the                    Systolic Heart failure treatment with If inhibitor                    ivabradine Trial (SHIFT). Furthermore, the updated European Society of                    Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the treatment of chronic HF recommend ivabradine                    for patients with sinus rhythm, LVEF ≤ 35 % and                    heart rate ≥70 bpm who remain symptomatic despite recommended                    therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin                    receptor blockers, β-blockers, or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists                        [63].

SHIFT was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre,                    placebo-controlled study, which investigated the effects of ivabradine                    (initiated at 5 mg twice daily and titrated to a maximum of                    7.5 mg twice daily) when added to current guideline-based therapy in                    6,558 patients with symptomatic chronic HF, LV systolic dysfunction                    (LVEF ≤ 35 %) and heart rate of 70 bpm                    or higher [64]. The primary endpoint of                    SHIFT was a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for                    worsening HF, and the median follow-up was 22.9 months.
SHIFT showed that ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular                    death and hospitalization due to worsening HF, compared with placebo, by                    18 % (937 [29 %] vs 793 [24 %], HR 0.82, 95 % CI                    0.75–0.90,                    p < 0.0001;                        Fig. 5) [65]. The number needed to treat for                    1 year to prevent one primary endpoint was 26. Furthermore, ivabradine                    reduced the risk of hospitalization for worsening HF, compared with placebo, by                    26 % (672 [21 %] vs 514 [16 %], HR 0.74, 95 % CI                    0.66–0.83,                    p < 0.001) and the                    risk of death related to HF by 26 % (151 [5 %] vs 113                    [3 %], HR 0.74, 95 % 0.58–0.94,                        p = 0.014) [65]. Importantly, the favourable effect of                    ivabradine on HF events became apparent within 3 months of initiation of                    treatment, and the benefits were maintained through the course of the trial. The                    effect was consistent across all pre-specified subgroups (elderly,                    β-blocker intake, cause of HF, diabetes mellitus and hypertension                    status, and baseline heart rate) [65].Fig. 5Results of the SHIFT study in patients with chronic heart failure                                (HF), showing the effects of ivabradine on the cumulative event                                curves for (a) the primary composite endpoint of                                cardiovascular (CV) death or hospital admission for worsening HF,                                    (b) hospital admission for worsening HF, and                                    (c) death from HF.

An increase in heart rate is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular                    events, and so patients with higher heart rate are expected to benefit the most                    from preventive therapy. This was shown in an analysis of patients enrolled in                    SHIFT whose heart rate was ≥75 bpm [66]. In these patients, ivabradine significantly reduced                    the primary composite endpoint, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality,                    HF death and HF hospitalization (Fig. 6). Risk reduction depended on heart rate after 28 days,                    with the best protection for heart rates <60 bpm or reductions                        >10 bpm.Fig. 6Effects of ivabradine on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with                                chronic heart failure (HF) and a baseline heart rate ≥75                                beats per minute: subanalysis of the SHIFT study. The primary                                composite endpoint of this study was cardiovascular death or                                hospital admission for worsening HF.

Another post-hoc analysis of SHIFT assessed the impact of background                    β-blockers on the response to ivabradine [67]. This analysis demonstrated that there was no evidence                    of an influence of β-blocker dose on the placebo-corrected change of                    heart rate with ivabradine. However, there was evidence of a clear effect of                    baseline heart rate on heart rate reduction                        (p < 0.0001), with                    the greatest changes in heart rate being observed in patients with the highest                    baseline heart rates [67]. After                    adjustment for the previously identified interaction between baseline heart rate                    and the effect of treatment with ivabradine, there was no evidence of a trend                    across the four dose categories, even in the analysis adjusting only for                    baseline heart rate (p = 0.135                    for the primary endpoint,                    p = 0.19 for hospital                    admission for worsening heart failure and                        p = 0.30 for                    cardiovascular death). This analysis indicated that the magnitude of heart rate                    reduction by ivabradine beyond what is achieved by a β-blocker, rather                    than the background β-blocker therapy itself, primarily determines                    subsequent outcome. The additional heart rate reduction achieved by adding                    ivabradine to the treatment regimen of patients whose heart rate was                    ≥70 bpm despite β-blockade (as well as those who could                    not tolerate β-blockers) was shown to be beneficial [67].
Another post-hoc analysis of SHIFT assessed the impact of background                    mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) on the response to ivabradine.                    This analysis showed that the beneficial effect of ivabradine observed in the                    patients with chronic HF enrolled in the SHIFT study was similar in patients who                    were receiving MRAs at baseline and those who were not. This shows that                    ivabradine improves outcomes in patients receiving multiple neurohormonal                    modulation treatments (ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker,                    β-blocker and/or MRA) and should be considered in patients receiving                    these treatments whose heart rate is ≥70 bpm [68].
Finally, an analysis of the SHIFT trial investigated the effect of ivabradine on                    recurrent hospitalizations for worsening HF in patients with chronic systolic HF                    receiving guideline-based background therapy [69]. This analysis showed that ivabradine significantly reduced the                    likelihood of recurrent hospitalizations for worsening HF. During the study                    (median follow-up 22.9 months), ivabradine was associated with a                    25 % reduction of the total number of hospitalizations for worsening of                    HF (902 vs 1,211 events with placebo,                        p = 0.0002;                        Fig. 7). Ivabradine-treated                    patients also had a lower risk of a second or third HF hospitalization (HR 0.66,                    95 % CI 0.55–0.79,                        p < 0.001; and HR                    0.71, 95 % CI 0.54–0.93,                        p = 0.012, respectively).                    Reduction of recurrent hospitalization for worsening HF is extremely important,                    as HF admissions are not only distressing for patients and their families, but                    also significantly affect patients’ quality of life and are the major                    driver of the economic burden of heart failure. In addition, hospitalization                    itself may not only be the consequence of worse prognosis but may contribute to                    worse outcome. Consequently, it is important to quantify the influence of                    treatment on these recurrent, non-fatal events because the true benefit of                    treatment should be determined by its effect on all events (including repeat                    events) and not just first events.Fig. 7Cumulative incidence of hospitalization for worsening heart failure                                (mean number of events per patient) in the SHIFT study.

The echocardiography substudy of the SHIFT trial showed that ivabradine has a                    beneficial effect on LV remodelling and function in patients with chronic HF                        [70]. This pre-planned substudy                    investigated the effects of ivabradine on the LVESVI and cardiac dimensions in                    411 patients who underwent echocardiography at baseline and after                    8 months of treatment. At 8 months, ivabradine treatment had                    significantly improved the LVESVI compared with placebo (−7.0 vs                        −0.9 mL/m2, difference −5.8, 95 %                    CI −8.8 to −2.7,                        p < 0.001).                    Compared with placebo, ivabradine also significantly reduced LV end-systolic                    volume (p < 0.001), LV                    end-diastolic volume index                    (p = 0.002) and LV                    end-diastolic volume                    (p = 0.001) and increased LVEF                        (p < 0.001) after                    8 months. These results indicate a reversal of cardiac remodelling with                    ivabradine. All changes in LV volumes and LVEF were consistent in all                    pre-specified subgroups regardless of the disease aetiology, baseline LVEF or                    β-blocker use. The beneficial effect of ivabradine was observed despite                    the fact that more than 90 % of the patients were receiving treatment                    with β-blockers and RAAS antagonists. As cardiac remodelling is a                    central feature of the progression of HF, these results have important clinical                    implications.
Ivabradine improves exercise capacity in patients with HF. The CARVIVA HF (effect                    of CARVedilol, IVAbradine or their combination on exercise capacity in patients                    with Heart Failure) study investigated the effects of ivabradine (up to                    7.5 mg twice daily) and the β-blocker carvedilol (up to                    25 mg twice daily) or their combination (5/12.5 mg twice daily)                    on exercise capacity in 121 patients with HF receiving a maximal dose of an                    angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor [71]. This prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint study                    showed that compared with carvedilol, ivabradine alone and in combination over                    12 weeks improved 6-min walk distance (from 346.7 to 474.8 m and                    from 358.2 to 453.1 m with ivabradine alone or in combination with                    carvedilol, respectively, vs from 379.0 to 435.7 m with carvedilol                    alone, p < 0.01 and                        p < 0.02) and                    exercise capacity, as assessed with a mixed venous oxygen saturation                        (MVO2) test. Significant improvements in peak maximal oxygen                    consumption (VO2) and the ventilatory anaerobic                    threshold (VAT) were also observed with ivabradine alone and in combination with                    carvedilol when compared with carvedilol alone                        (p < 0.01 and                        p < 0.03,                    respectively). The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class improved                    significantly more in patients receiving ivabradine alone or in combination than                    in those allocated to carvedilol alone.
The effects of ivabradine on exercise capacity, gas exchange, functional class,                    quality of life, and neurohormonal modulation in patients with ischaemic                    congestive HF were demonstrated in a study by Sarullo et al. [72]. This randomized, placebo-controlled                    study showed that ivabradine had a positive effect on exercise capacity and                    clinical symptoms in the 60 patients who were enrolled. The exercise capacity                    increased from 14.8 to 28.2 min                        (p < 0.0001), and                    the peak oxygen consumption improved from 13.5 to 17.9 mL/kg per minute                        (p < 0.0001) in                    the ivabradine group. NTproBNP levels decreased from 2,356 to                    1,434 pg/mL                    (p = 0.045).
Ivabradine has also been shown to improve quality of life in patients with                    chronic HF [71–73]. Firstly, patient-reported global                    assessment in patients in the SHIFT trial showed significant improvement in                    2,118 patients (72 %) in the ivabradine group compared with 2,017                    (68 %) in the placebo group                        (p = 0.0005). There was                    also significant improvement in NYHA class at the last recorded value in 887                    patients (28 %) on ivabradine versus 776 patients (24 %) on                    placebo (p = 0.001) [65]. The Patient-Reported Outcomes                    substudy of the SHIFT trial showed that a reduction in heart rate with                    ivabradine improved health-related quality-of-life parameters, as assessed by                    the disease-specific Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) [73]. After 12 months of ivabradine                    therapy, significant improvements in health-related quality of life were shown                    across all eight dimensions of the KCCQ, compared with placebo, in patients with                    chronic HF (n = 1,944). These                    changes were observed after 4 months of treatment and were maintained                    until the last post-baseline visit (24 months). Moreover, the                    improvement in KCCQ scores seen at 12 months was associated with the                    magnitude of the observed heart rate reduction seen with ivabradine, and this                    benefit was maintained at 24 months. An improvement of 5 or more points                    on the KCCQ is considered to be clinically meaningful, so this analysis shows                    that ivabradine is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in                    health-related quality of life [73].
The CARVIVA HF study showed that patients receiving ivabradine alone or in                    combination with carvedilol had a better quality of life than those receiving                    carvedilol alone [71]. Quality of life                    was assessed in this study using both a VAS and the MacNew Quality of Life after                    Myocardial Infarction (QLMI) questionnaire. Ivabradine and combination therapy                    significantly improved the overall assessment of quality of life from baseline                    (from 4.3 to 6.7                    [p < 0.01] and from                    4.7 to 6.1 [p < 0.02],                    respectively). In contrast, quality-of-life scores did not improve with                    carvedilol (from 4.6 to 4.1) [71]. These                    findings are further supported by another study by Sarullo et al. [72], which also demonstrated that                    ivabradine improved quality of life. Compared with placebo, ivabradine                    significantly improved Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire scores                    after 3 months of treatment.
Individual trial data from SHIFT and BEAUTIFUL were pooled to determine the                    effect of ivabradine on outcomes in a wide range of patients with LVSD, heart                    rate ≥70 bpm, and CAD and/or HF [74]. The pooled population                        (n = 11,897, baseline age                    62.3 ± 10.4 years, heart rate                    79.6 ± 9.2 bpm, and LVEF                    30.3 ± 5.6 %) was well treated according to                    current recommendations (87 % received β-blockers, 90 %                    received RAAS inhibitors). Median follow-up was 21 months. Treatment                    with ivabradine led to a significant 13 % reduction in the relative risk                    of the SHIFT primary composite endpoint [cardiovascular mortality or                    hospitalization for worsening heart failure] versus placebo                        (p < 0.001), and a                    15 % reduction in the relative risk of the BEAUTIFUL primary composite                    endpoint [cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute MI, or admission                    to hospital for new-onset or worsening heart failure]                        (p < 0.001). The                    relative risk reduction of the SHIFT composite endpoint was driven by a                    13 % relative risk reduction in hospitalization for worsening heart                    failure, while that of the BEAUTIFUL composite endpoint was driven by                    10 % relative risk reductions in cardiovascular death and hospital                    admission for MI. Treatment with ivabradine also led to significant reductions                    in a range of heart failure outcomes in patients with heart rate                    ≥75 bpm                    (n = 7,632 [64 %])                    compared with placebo. Cardiovascular mortality or hospitalization for worsening                    heart failure                    (p < 0.0001),                    cardiovascular mortality                    (p = 0.049), hospitalization                    for worsening heart failure                        (p < 0.0001) and                    all-cause mortality                    (p = 0.048) were all reduced                    with ivabradine in these patients. This analysis also confirmed the safety of                    ivabradine in a large population with LVSD, particularly with regard to                    bradycardia. It also showed that regardless of clinical presentation or profile,                    ivabradine has an important role in the treatment of patients with LVSD and                    elevated heart rate ≥70 bpm.
Ivabradine has a favourable tolerability profile, as observed during its clinical                development [44, 75]. It is safe and well tolerated when administered as a                monotherapy [19, 23, 45] or when                administered in combination with atenolol [48], bisoprolol [49], other                β-blockers [50, 58] or other cardiovascular therapies [24]. Ivabradine was well tolerated in a range                of patient populations, including those with stable angina, CAD or HF [22, 65].
Ivabradine is also well tolerated in patients with co-morbidities including asthma                and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [21, 57] or in patients with                diabetes mellitus, without any particular safety concerns or adverse effects on                glucose metabolism [57]. Another important                advantage of ivabradine is that it can be safely used in the presence of low blood                pressure because it has no effect on blood pressure or other haemodynamic                parameters.
The two most common adverse events associated with the recommended doses of                ivabradine are bradycardia and visual symptoms [75]. Bradycardia is an expected adverse event of any heart rate-reducing                treatment. However, in the clinical programme of ivabradine, only                3–4 % of patients receiving therapeutic doses of ivabradine (5 or                7.5 mg twice daily) experienced symptomatic bradycardia. Furthermore, there                were very low rates of discontinuation in these studies due to this adverse event                    [23, 59, 65]. For example in the                SHIFT trial, bradycardia led to permanent withdrawal from the study of 48 patients                (1 %) on ivabradine versus 10 (<1 %) of those in the placebo                group [59]. A Holter substudy of the                BEAUTIFUL trial investigated the cardiac safety of ivabradine in patients with                stable CAD and LV systolic dysfunction also receiving β-blockers [22]. In this study, 840 patients who were                enrolled in the BEAUTIFUL trial also underwent 24-h digital ambulatory ECG recording                at baseline and after 1 and 6 months of treatment. There was no increase in                the incidence of conduction and rhythm disturbances with ivabradine compared with                placebo [22]. This study showed that                ivabradine significantly lowers heart rate without affecting cardiac safety.
The visual symptoms associated with ivabradine are due to the action of ivabradine on                retinal ion channels (Ih current), which belong to the                same family as those responsible for the If current in                the sino-atrial node. In the clinical trials of ivabradine, visual symptoms (mainly                phosphenes) were reported in a small proportion of patients. These symptoms were                generally mild and resolved spontaneously during or after treatment. Fewer than                1 % of patients receiving ivabradine in clinical trials discontinued                treatment because of visual symptoms [19,                    23, 24, 45, 48–50, 58, 65].
Ivabradine is available in 5 mg and 7.5 mg film-coated tablets. For                the treatment of CAD, the recommended starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg                twice daily, which can be up-titrated to 7.5 mg twice daily after 3 or                4 weeks if the resting heart rate is still above 60 bpm. The dose of                ivabradine can be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily if the resting heart rate                goes below 50 bpm or if the patient experiences symptoms related to                bradycardia, such as dizziness, fatigue or hypotension, during treatment with the                recommended daily dose of ivabradine.
For the treatment of chronic HF, the recommended starting dose of ivabradine is                5 mg twice daily, which can be titrated up to 7.5 mg twice daily                after 2 weeks if the resting heart rate is still above 60 bpm [44]. If the resting heart rate is below                50 bpm or if the patient experiences symptoms related to bradycardia,                ivabradine can be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily.
A lower starting dose (2.5 mg twice daily) is recommended in patients aged                75 years or older. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal                insufficiency and creatinine clearance above 15 mL/min, or in patients with                mild hepatic impairment.
The pharmacologic properties and clinical efficacy of ivabradine make it an important                therapeutic choice for patients with stable CAD or HF. The positive effect of                ivabradine on angina pectoris symptoms and myocardial ischaemia, and its ability to                reduce myocardial ischemia, make it an important agent in the management of patients                with stable CAD.
Following the results of SHIFT, ivabradine has also been approved for the treatment                of patients with chronic HF and LVSD who remain symptomatic and therefore are still                at risk of high mortality despite therapy with conventional agents such as RAAS                blockers or β-blockers. The use of ivabradine improves prognosis, reduces                recurrent hospitalizations and improves quality of life in patients with chronic                heart failure with LVSD.
Further studies are evaluating the efficacy of ivabradine for prevention of                cardiovascular events in patients with CAD but without clinical HF. The SIGNIFY                (Study assessInG the morbidity–mortality beNefits of the                    If inhibitor ivabradine in patients with coronarY                artery disease) trial includes patients with stable CAD and an LVEF above                40 %, with no clinical sign of HF, and is investigating the long-term                effects (over a period of 48 months) of ivabradine in a large study                population [76]. So far, this study has                included more than 19,000 patients from 51 countries. The results of SIGNIFY will                undoubtedly provide further insights into the role of ivabradine in CAD                patients.
