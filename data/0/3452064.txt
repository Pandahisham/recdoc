Clinic–based study of family history of vascular risk factors and migraine

The objective was toevaluate the presence of a positivefamily history (FH) of vascular riskfactors between patients withmigraine with aura (MA) andmigraine without aura (MO), and inchronic migraine (CM) compared toother headache types. As migrainepatients are typically too young tohave developed vascular events,studying older relatives of migrainepatients may be a practical meansof evaluating associations betweenvascular risk factors and migraine.A cross–sectional study of a clinicbasedsample of adults withmigraine headache was carried outat the University of Utah. Predictorvariables comprised first or seconddegree relatives with stroke, hypertension,diabetes or hypercholesterolaemia.Outcome measurescomprised diagnosis of MA, MO orCM according to the revisedInternational Headache Society criteria.There was no significant differencein FH of vascular risk factorsin MA compared to MO(adjusted OR 1.04, 95% CI0.61–1.78). CM was associatedwith a decreased risk of FH ofstroke (OR=0.11, 95% CI0.02–0.87, p=0.036). There was nosignificant difference in FH of vascularrisk factors in MA patientscompared to MO. CM patients weremore likely to have a negative FHof stroke compared to otherheadache types, suggesting that CMis likely a neuronal disease ratherthan a vascular one.
