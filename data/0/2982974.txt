A STUDY ON THE COPING BEHAVIOURS OF WIVES OF ALCOHOLICS

A study was conducted on 30 wives of alcoholics using Orford-Guthrie's ‘coping with drinking’ questionnaire. Tlie commonest coping behaviour reported was discord, avoidance, indulgence and fearful withdrawal while marital breakdown, taking special action, assertion and sexual withdrawal were least frequent. There was no significant correlation between the coping behaviours and the variables like duration of marriage, duration of husband’s alcoholism, socio-economic and educational status. Implications of these findings are discussed and a cross cultural comparison is made.
