AN ORGANISM RESEMBLING BACILLUS ACTINOIDES ISOLATED FROM PNEUMONIC LUNGS OF WHITE RATS

 An organism obtained from the pneumonic lungs of eleven white rats is described. It has been maintained in pure culture in a number of instances. In young cultures the organism appears as a long slender bacillus. In older cultures on coagulated serum media characteristic club-like capsular material is formed. On blood agar characteristic swellings appear at one or both ends of the rod. These become more refringent, and the body of the organism begins to shrink. Finally only rounded spore-like refringent bodies are found. The organism is Gram-negative.
