Double-Blind Comparison of Iodamide and Diatrizoate for Excretory Urography 1

Supported in part by a grant from the Squibb Institute for Medical Research.
A double-blind comparison of meglumine iodamide and Renografin 60 (52% meglumine diatrizoate and 8% sodium diatrizoate) for bolus excretory urography was performed. Doses of 0.8 cc/kg. to a maximum of 55 cc were administered to fifty patients, twenty-five receiving each drug.
There is a suggestion that iodamide may be superior to diatrizoate in pyelocalyceal opacification while being equal to diatrizoate in parenchymal opacification and in types and severity of side-effects.
