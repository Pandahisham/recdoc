There wasmicronodular cirrhosis of the liver and the spleen was enlarged. The bleeding was traced to distendedveins in the right paracolic gutter which were oversewn and the abdomen closed. A coagulopathy wasdiagnosed and treatment including high dose aprotinin commenced. However, he continued to bleedand at a second laparotomy the area of previous haemorrhage was packed. Further deteriorationcontinued until death 12 hours later. Intraperitoneal haemorrhage from ectopic varices is a rareoccurrence.

On the basis of this report aprotinin would notseem to be of benefit for this condition.
