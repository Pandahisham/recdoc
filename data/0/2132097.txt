LYMPH PRESSURES IN STERILE INFLAMMATION

 1. The normal lymph pressure in the legs of anesthetized dogs is not measurable. 2. The maximum pressure of lymph in the quiescent leg under conditions of sterile inflammation is around 120 cm. of lymph. 3. Venous pressure rises immediately in a region subjected to sterile inflammation and then slowly returns to normal. The rise in lymph pressure follows the rise in venous pressure. 4. Changes in lymph flow, lymph pressure, and protein concentration of the lymph occur when the part producing lymph is subjected to external temperatures between 50° and 60°C.
