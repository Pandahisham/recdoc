Bone marrow aspirate showing Leishmania donovani in polymorphs



A 41-year-old man who was a permanent resident of Uttarakhand, a north Himalayan and sub-Himalayan state of India, presented with bilateral pedal edema and backache. He had no history of fever, hepatosplenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy and was clinically suspected of having multiple myeloma. A complete blood cell count test showed normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 7.5 g/dL) with normal white blood cell count and platelet count. Biochemical investigations showed decreased albumin (2.1 g/dL) and increased globulin (8.6 g/dL) levels with a high serum alkaline phosphatase level (315 IU/L; reference range, 33-96 IU/L). A subsequent bone marrow examination revealed hemophagocytosis (1+) and elevated plasma cells (14%) and iron stores (4+). In addition, both extracellular and intracellular Leishmania donovani (LD) bodies were observed. Interestingly, these LD bodies were present inside neutrophils, which is an uncommon feature of leishmaniasis (Giemsa stain, Ã—1,000). LD bodies, if intracellular, are usually present in the histiocytes. However, the present clinically unsuspected case of leishmaniasis from a nonendemic region demonstrated the presence of LD bodies inside neutrophils. This observation is rarely reported and is considered an uncommon finding in bone marrow examinations.
