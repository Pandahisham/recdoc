Cutaneous remnants of the vitellointestinal duct: a clinico-pathological study of 19 cases

The presence of cutaneous vitellointestinal duct remnants was confirmed histologically in 19 cases in the period 1970-1984. These lesions occurred mostly in males (16 males, 3 females), and 80% in children under the age of five years. One case was identified in an adult, suggesting that these lesions may in some cases cause little inconvenience, and that their true incidence is underestimated.
