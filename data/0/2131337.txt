ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT AND VACCINE VIRUS 

 Rabbit skin treated for a few minutes with ultra-violet light and then inoculated at once with vaccine virus is less susceptible to the action of the virus than is untreated skin. If 24, 48, or 72 hours elapse between the time of irradiation and inoculation, the treated skin appears to be more susceptible than is untreated skin. Skin repeatedly exposed to ultra-violet light is less susceptible to the action of vaccine virus than is non-irradiated skin.
