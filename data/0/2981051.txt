POST - CATARACTOMY DELIRIUM : A TWO YEAR PROSPECTIVE STUDY

A two year prospective study of 221 consecutive inpatients undergoing cataractomy revealed the incidence of post-cataractomy delirium to be 1.8%. While in one case the delirium was due to anticholinergic toxicity, in the remaining three cases no organic cause was evident. Sensory deprivation was present in two patients. Preventive measures for the condition are discussed.
