High dose melphalan, BCNU and etoposide with autologous bone marrow transplantation for Hodgkin's disease.

Thirty-eight patients with previously treated Hodgkin's disease were given high dose combination chemotherapy using melphalan and BCNU and autologous bone marrow transplantation. In 25 patients etoposide was added in conventional dosage. During the course of the study the dose of melphalan was increased from 80 to 140 mg m-2 and the dose of BCNU from 300 to 600 mg m-2. The response rate was 76% with 53% complete remission. Forty-five per cent of the patients are free of disease at 4-20 months follow-up. There were eight (26%) treatment-related deaths due to lung damage (seven cases) and irreversible cardiac failure (one case). Fatal lung damage occurred only in patients receiving 600 mg m-2 of BCNU with high dose melphalan. The dose of BCNU given with high dose melphalan should not exceed 500 mg m-2. This treatment is effective against relapsed Hodgkin's disease but must be used cautiously. The best time for its use remains to be determined.
