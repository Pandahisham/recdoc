A CEREBELLAR DISORDER IN CHICKS, APPARENTLY OF NUTRITIONAL ORIGIN

 Growing chicks maintained on a diet consisting of milk powder, casein, starch, yeast, cod liver oil, salts and filter paper develop ataxia, tremors, retraction or twisting of the head, clonic spasms of the legs, and stupor. These symptoms may appear suddenly, usually between the 18th and 25th day, and may end in death. If recovery takes place, the chicks may go on to normal development. Definite lesions are found in the cerebellum of the affected chicks. These consist of edema, necrosis and hemorrhages. Hyaline thrombi are found in the capillaries in and about the degenerated areas.
