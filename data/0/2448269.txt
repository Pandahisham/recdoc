Crohn's disease in Northern Ireland--a retrospective study of 440 cases.

The incidence of Crohn's disease in the community is thought to be changing, with conflicting evidence for increases, decreases or steady state situations being described. A retrospective study, using strict criteria for diagnosis, for a 16 year period in Northern Ireland demonstrated an increasing incidence of Crohn's disease, with a distribution in the population similar to that described in previous studies.
