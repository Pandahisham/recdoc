					Background. Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency for which prompt diagnosis and treatment are imperative to reducing the rate of death and long-term neurologic compromise. Few cases of meningitis have been reported during pregnancy, many of which had devastating outcomes for mother, neonate, or both. Case. A 38-year-old multigravida at 35 weeks of gestation presented with mental status changes, fever, and preterm contractions. Lumbar puncture revealed gram positive cocci consistent with S. pneumoniae. Patient was intubated and admitted to ICU where she was given antibiotics and adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone. Continuous fetal monitoring was utilized throughout her course of her hospitalization. Patient was discharged home after ten days in the hospital and had an uncomplicated vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) at 38 weeks. Both she and the infant are doing well with no permanent neurologic sequelae. Conclusion. A review of literature indicates only isolated cases of pneumococcal meningitis being described during pregnancy. An extended period of time between onset of maternal illness and delivery appears to reduce the risk of neonatal transmission and improve both maternal and fetal outcomes.

Bacterial meningitis has an annual incidence of 4â€“6cases per 100 000 adults and results in approximately 135 000deaths worldwide each year. Since the development of theHaemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, the mostcommon bacterial pathogen for community-acquired meningitis isStreptococcus pneumoniae which has a fatalityrate from 19% to 37%. In patients that survive theinitial insult, neurologic sequelae including seizures, hearingloss, impaired mental status, and/or cognition may occur in asmany as 30% of all cases [1]. Local extension from contiguous extracerebral infection (e.g., otitis media, mastoiditis, or sinusitis) is acommon cause. Patients with bacterial meningitis will usuallypresent soon after the onset of symptoms with a classic triad offever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Promptrecognition and treatment are key steps to reducing the morbidityand mortality associated with bacterial meningitis. In this casereport, we describe a patient who presented during the thirdtrimester of pregnancy with fever, mental status changes, and asubsequent diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. We will review theevaluation and management of this case as well as provide aliterature review of other case reports of pneumococcalmeningitis in pregnancy.
A 38-year-old multigravida with an intrauterine pregnancy at 35weeks was found unconscious at her home and airlifted to thenearest tertiary care center. Throughout transport and uponarrival at the ED, her mental status alternated between combativeand lethargic and was unable to provide any coherent informationregarding her present condition or past medical history. Herfamily later reported that the patient had presented to herprimary care physician five days earlier with complaints of leftotalgia and low grade fever. Treatment was initiated withazithromycin for otitis media, but her pain continued to worsenprecipitating an emergency room visit the day before her admissionto the hospital. She received prescriptions foramoxicillin-clavulanate and opioids at this visit but had not yetstarted these medications. Her husband reported several bouts ofemesis that same evening before her changes in mental status thefollowing morning. Her primary obstetrician was also contacted andshe verified an uncomplicated prenatal care with a term vaginaldelivery in her first pregnancy, followed by a caesarian deliveryfor breech presentation in her second pregnancy. The patient hadbeen counseled during this pregnancy regarding mode of deliveryand opted for repeat caesarean section at 39 weeks.
On arrival in the ED, she was febrile to 38.7 C, with a pulse rateof 152 bpm, respiratory rate of 40, blood pressure of 147/80,and Glasgow coma score of 11 (4 for eye opening, 1 verbal, 6movement). Fetal heart tones were noted to be 170 bpm withreassuring variability. Uterine contractions were noted every 2-3minutes and initial sterile vaginal exam indicated cervicaldilation of 4 cm with 50% effacement. The fetus wasvertex in presentation with a size consistent for statedgestational age and a normal amniotic fluid index. The remainderof the physical examination was significant for purulent drainagefrom her left ear with marked erythema of both tympanicmembranes. She was also noted to have decreased breath sounds atthe base of the right lung. Complete blood count revealed aleukocytosis of 55 000 with 70% granulocytes and22% bands. Chest X-ray indicated a possible infiltrate inthe right middle and lower lobes. The patient was then intubatedfor airway protection, sedated, and given cetriaxone (2 g q 12hours, IV) for empiric treatment of meningitis before being sentto the radiology suite. CT scan of the head revealed fluidcollection in the middle ear and mastoid on the left. She wastransferred to the intensive care unit and lumbar punctureobtained with 12 750 leukoctyes (80% PMN), glucose <5,and protein of 965. Preliminary blood and cerebrospinal fluidcultures indicated gram positive cocci in chains, consistent withS. pneumoniae. Vancomycin (1 g q 24 hours,IV) was then added for broader coverage, and dexamethasone (10mg q 6 hours, IV) started as adjuvant therapy. Myringotomy atbedside revealed frank purulence in the middle ear which wasevacuated and sent for culture. Continuous fetal and uterinemonitoring was initiated with an experienced labor and deliverynurse posted at bedside for signs of fetal distress or continuedpreterm labor. This comprehensive level of care was continueduntil the level of sedation was decreased and the patient wasextubated. Uterine contractions ceased in regularity after thefirst 24 hours with no further cervical change noted. Patientremained intubated until hospital day eight when her mentalstatus had returned to baseline. At this time, she wastransferred to the antepartum floor for two additional days ofsurveillance before discharge home. Final cultures from blood,CSF, and ear were consistent with S. pneumoniaewith sensitivity to vancomycin. Patient completed the final fourdays of a 14-day course of vancomycin and ceftriaxone at home.Her obstetrical care was then returned to her primaryobstetrician.
At 38 weeks gestation, the patient presented to her primaryobstetrician with uterine contractions and was noted to be 9 cmdilated. She had a successful VBAC delivery of a male infantweighing eight pounds with APGAR scores of 8 and 9, at 1 and 5minutes, respectively. Mother and child are doing well at thetime of this writing, with no sequelae since delivery.
Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency in which earlydiagnosis and treatment is imperative to prevent death and reducelong-term complications. Lumbar puncture is used to confirm thediagnosis in patients presenting with clinically suspectedmeningitis; however, imaging should be completed first in patientswith new-onset seizures, an immunocompromised state, signsconcerning for mass lesion or moderate-severe level ofconsciousness. If imaging is to be performed before lumbarpuncture, empiric therapy should be initiated first as a delay intreatment can result in poor outcomes. The choice of initialantimicrobial therapy is based on the most common bacteria causingthe disease according to the patient's age and the clinicalsetting and on patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility. With theworldwide increase in the prevalence of penicillin-resistantpneumococci, combination therapy with vancomycin plus athird-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) hasbecome the standard approach to empirical antimicrobial therapy.Intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg q 6 hours for 4 days, IV)before or with the first dose of antibiotics has been shown toreduce the risk of death (14% versus 34%) andneurologic disability (26% versus 52%) in adultswith pneumococcal meningitis when compared to placebo [2].
In a recent prospective study, the clinical features andprognostic factors were described in adults with bacterialmeningitis. Risk factors for an unfavorable outcome were advancedage (>60 years), presence of otitis/sinusitis, absence of rash,low score on Glasgow coma score (<8), tachycardia (>120bpm), a positive blood culture, an elevated erythrocytesedimentation rate (>56), decreased platelet count(<180 000/mm3), low CSF white-cell count (<100/mm3),and causative species S. pneumoniae [3]. In the current case, thelikely mechanism for transmission of the pathogen was throughinvasion of the central nervous system from a case of severeotitis media. Hence, our patient met a minimum of six of theseten criteria (tachycardia, otitis, absence of rash, positiveblood culture, low CSF white-cell count, S.pneumoniae) placing her at increased risk for a poor outcome. Inaddition, it is not clear what impact the state of pregnancy hason prognosis for both mother and neonate.
A review of the literature was conducted using MEDinesearch and review of references cited. Key words utilized includepregnancy, meningitis, and pneumococcal. This revealed five singlecase reports and a small case series of women diagnosed withpneumococcal meningitis during pregnancy or the postpartum period.Lucas described 26 cases of pneumococcal meningitis in Nigerianduring pregnancy (n = 15) or the immediate postpartum period (n= 11) during a time period from 1958 to 1962 [4]. The overall fatality rate forthis group of women was 27% (7/26), and the rate ofneurologic sequelae in survivors at time of discharge was53% (10/19). The type of complications included hearingloss, severe emotional disturbance, aphasia, and hemiplegia. Ofthe 15 women diagnosed during pregnancy, 3 of the mothers diedand the fetal loss rate from spontaneous abortion, stillbirth,and neonatal death was 47% (7/15). The high incidence ofcases in Nigeria during this time period led the author tosuggest that pregnancy predisposes women to pneumococcalmeningitis. Although pregnancy does result in a diminished immuneresponse, there is no data to conclude that there is increasedrisk specific to S. pneumoniae.
The single patient case reports are outlined inTable 1 (see [5â€“9]). The timeinterval between onset of maternal illness and the delivery ofthe neonate is less than 36 hours in three cases. Each of thesecases resulted in either a fetal or maternal death, and in oneinstance both mother and infant died. In the other two cases, thetime frame between onset of maternal illness and delivery wasextended with a favorable outcome for both mother and infant.With the current case, discussion initially focused on whether itwas prudent to move towards delivery, especially in light of herearly signs of labor and her family's strong desire for acaesarian delivery. However, continuous fetal monitoringindicated a reassuring status throughout her hospitalization, andall signs of preterm labor had diminished leaving no indicationfor a premature delivery. It is difficult to draw conclusions fromisolated reports, but the scant literature available suggests thatan extended interval between the onset of maternal illness anddelivery provides an important window of time for maternal andneonatal well-being.
