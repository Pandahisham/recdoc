The rupture of retroperitoneal varices is a rare and catastrophic complication of portal hypertension. We describe a case of this nature, the first in Brazilian medical literature, and also reviewing all previous 34 cases. We systematically analyzed all therapeutic approach and propose a management algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of this lethal condition. The majority of the patients presented with abdominal pain, distention and hypotension, and developed hemorrhagic shock. Rupture of retroperitoneal varices can be properly managed if an early diagnosis is made and surgery is performed promptly, which is the only effective treatment. Arteriography should be used when the suspicion is of rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The first case of rupture of retroperitoneal varices, a rare and catastrophiccomplication of portal hypertension, has been reported in 1958 [1]. According to our research over Medline and PubMed, to date, only 34 similarcases have been described with high mortality rates even nowadays [1–38]. We used hemoperitoneum and varices as keywords for search. The aim of thisarticle is to describe a case of this nature, the first in Brazilian medicalliterature, and also reviewing all previous cases. We systematically analyzedall therapeutic approaches and propose a management algorithm for diagnosis andtreatment of this lethal condition. Rupture of retroperitoneal varices can beproperly managed if an early diagnosis is made and surgery is performedpromptly.
A 51-year-old woman entered the Emergency Department of Universitary Hospital of theUniversity of Sao Paulo (USP) in March 2006 presenting with abdominal pain fortwo days, associated with nausea and vomits. She also reported abdominaldistention for the last fourteen days.
Her pastmedical history showed a chronic abuse of alcohol leading to liver cirrhosisassociated to Hepatitis B. She had been under medical follow-up with aclinician from 2001 to 2004, when she abandoned medical care.
Herphysical examination was remarkable for an ill-appearing, pale, jaundiced, anddyspneic patient. She had a heart rate of 100 beats/min and a systolic bloodpressure of 95 and diastolic of 65 mm Hg. Abdominal examination revealeddiminished bowel sounds, a slight distention, and diffuse tenderness duringpalpation, with no guarding. Admission laboratory values showed hemoglobinlevel of 6.4 g/dL. MELD score of 24, Child-Pugh grade C.
Anendoscopy was carried out, which showed a healed distal esophageal ulcer, ahiatal hernia, and erosive gastritis of the body and antrum. There were no signsof esophageal varices.
A fewhours after entering the Emergency Department she developed severe hypotensionof 70/40 mm Hg, Glasgow coma scale 14, tachycardia of 125 beats/min. Sheunderwent volume resuscitation with no sustained response. Treatment forSpontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis was initiated with Ceftriaxone. Additionaltreatment with norepinephrine was started as she remained hypotensive evenafter the continuous infusion of volume. She was then transferred to theintensive care unit. She had progressive hemodynamic instability, abdominaldistention, and altered mental status, requiring endotracheal intubation.
At thistime a surgeon was requested to examine the patient. A paracentesis was carriedout; the peritoneal fluid was hemorrhagic with a hematocrit of 12%. Laboratoryvalues at this moment were hemoglobin level of 3.8 and INR of 7.29. She wasthen transfused with packed RBCs and plasma. Reaching hemodynamic stability sheunderwent an exploratory laparotomy.
About 5 L of blood were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. A rupturedretroperitoneal varix was found to be the cause of bleeding, next to themesenteric root. Direct ligation of the vessel led the bleeding to stop (Figure 1). The liver was cirrhotic; an exuberant collateral circulation was seen onthe retroperitoneum and on the abdominal wall, with canalization of theUmbilical vein, with an 8 mm diameter. The Retzius vein was identified in bothparacolic gutters, with a lot of collaterals. A liver biopsy was made. Laterhistopathological evaluation revealed steatohepatitis grade IV (alcoholic andnonalcoholic).
Returningto the intensive care unit the patient was massively transfused with packedRBCs and plasma for anemia and coagulopathy. She continued to behemodynamically unstable associated with renal and hepatic failure. On the sixthposoperatory she died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
Traumaand nonmalignant gynecological conditions account for more than 90% ofintraperitoneal hemorrhages [2]. The main cause of hemoperitoneum inwomen is the rupture of an ectopic pregnancy; in men, the major cause is theposttraumatic rupture of the liver or spleen [2]. The vascular causesare also relevant, as the Aorta Aneurysm, rupture of viscera, and hemorrhagicpancreatitis. Inflammatory and hematological disorders rarely manifest ashemoperitoneum.
Incirrhotic patients with ascites the intraperitoneal bleeding occurs most of thetimes due to structural lesions such as hepatocellular carcinoma or ovarycancer and rupture of intraperitoneal varices [3].
Theintraperitoneal varices rupture is a rare event, whose incidence unknown, andit is related to severe portal hypertension. We believe that the real incidenceof this pathology is much superior than the 34 cases described in literature dueto misdiagnosis. It also appears in patients with terminal liver disease,mostly in a fulminate way.
Portalhypertension leads to the development of portosystemic shunts in well-definedanatomic sites. The most acknowledged sites include the gastroesophageal veinsconnecting the azigohemiazigos system, the hemorrhoidary veins from theinferior mesenteric vein, communicating with the tributaries of the InternalIliac Vein and the Umbilical and periumbilical veins draining to the leftPortal Vein and to the epigastric veins of the anterior abdominal wall. Therecanalization of the Umbilical vein is known as Cruveillier-BaumgartenSyndrome [1, 4]. There are also shunts of the Retzius veins connectingthe Colic veins with the lumbar and the lower intercostals veins; pancreaticveins connecting the splenic vein and the left renal vein; numerous venouscanals communicating the liver with the diaphragm (Sappey veins) [1].
Thereare 34 cases of intraperitoneal bleeding due to rupture of varices described inliterature, as shown in Table 1. Including our patient, 27 were men and 8 werewomen. The age onset was 21 to 76 years old (average of 48.8). Only one casereported in literature was of a noncirrhotic patient. Table 1 summarizesthe presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and results of the cases described inliterature. 			
Themajority of the patients presented with abdominal pain, distention andhypotension, and developed hemorrhagic shock. The diagnosis was established byparacentesis, angiography, ultrasound Doppler, and tomography. Even so, thediagnosis was confirmed only by laparotomy.
Thehemoperitoneum diagnosis is confirmed by paracentesis when the Ht > 5%. Theparacentesis was important in the diagnosis and surgical indication is most ofthe cases. Only two cases out of ten who survived did not undergo theparacentesis [5, 6]. In one of them, the diagnosis was suggested viatomography and confirmed at laparotomy [5].
Theangiography was used as an attempt to achieve the diagnosis in 6 cases ofhemoperitoneum by varices inside the abdomen [7–12]. The source of thebleeding was identified only in one patient. However, this patient past awayprobably because of recurrent bleeding [8]. In one case the angiogrammay have anticipated the recurrent bleeding and finally his death [9].
The onlyeffective treatment was surgery. None of the 7 patients treated in anonchirurgical basis survived. Twenty eight were operated, twelve survived. The global mortality rate was 65.7%. And for the patients submitted to surgeryit was of 57.1%. The causes leading of death were uncontrollable or recurrentbleeding, liver failure, kidney failure, heart failure, and aspiration of bloodfrom ruptured esophageal varices.
Out of28 cases that underwent surgery, in twenty six the ligation of the bleedingvessels was successful, and eleven survived the after surgery period. In twocases who underwent surgery, the ligation was not possible [12, 13], andthe patient died of bleeding, even after the use of a portocaval shunt as anattemptive to relieve the portal hypertension [12]. Only one patientsurvived after a porto-systemic shunt [14].
Themanagement of the bleeding from intra-abdominal varices is difficult sincethere are no randomized trials due to the rareness of this situation [15]. However, this condition seems to be underestimated, probably because most ofthe patients present tense ascitis and hepatic disease in a terminal stateleading rapidly to death [2].
Thepatients' survival rate seems to be related to three important facts: thepatient's functional hepatic reserve, the importance of the hemorrhagic shockin its presentation, and the early operative intervention and control of thebleeding source [3, 16].
Thefirst challenge in the management of these cases is in the differentialdiagnosis of acute hemorrhagic abdomen in a cirrhotic patient. We suggest a flowchartbased on the analysis of all the published cases related to intraperitonealvarices and a review of the articles related to the other causes ofhemoperitoneum in cirrhotic patients (Figure 2).
Theparacentesis with Ht over 5% is a precise indicator of intra-abdominal bleedingthat can dimish the risk of unnecessary laparotomies [2]. It may berepeated in another site to exclude a punction accident and has rarely been torelate to hemorrhagic complications [16]. 			
Once thebleeding in a cirrhotic patient was identified, the diagnostic orientation ismade on differing HCC rupture, bleeding intra-abdominal varices, vascularcauses such as aorta's aneurism, and gynecological causes.
Wesuggest checking the dosage level of HCG in women, followed by Abdominal DuplexScan in both sexes as the first diagnostic step. Duplex scan can provideinformation on the Aorta and its branches, the abdominal collateralcirculation, the patency of the Portal Vein, hepatic nodules and tumors, and theovaries.
Computerizedtomographic scanning was suggested by Bataille et al. [15] and Goldsteinet al. [5] as the first diagnostic approach for excluding rupture ofhepatocellular carcinoma and all other causes. It is, though, more expensivethan the Duplex Scan, and it is not always available in all emergency services. On the other hand, it provides more detailed information on other acutehemorrhagic abdomen.
Arteriographyhas proved to be an inefficient investigation for diagnosis and treatment ofretroperitoneal bleeding varices. It postpones the surgical treatment [14], the only one that has been effective in these cases. Thus, it is very importantto notice that arteriography has a fundamental role in the treatment of therupture of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is the main differential diagnosisas mentioned before.
Thefundamental treatment of variceal bleeding is the ligation of the vessel. Nevertheless, the Surgical Portosystemic Shunt or the Transjugular IntrahepaticPortosystemic Shunt (TIPSS) must be considered for selected patients.
In theoperation room, the decision of performing a Portosystemic shunt must take intoconsideration the patient's clinical condition and the time needed to performthe shunt. In unstable patients and with little hepatic functional reserve westrongly suggest not increasing the surgical time. However, multiple bleedingvarices or the possibility of a new bleed should be analyzed in order to decideif the shunt must be performed.
TIPSSwas not performed in any of the reported cases. Nevertheless, the way weunderstand its use for treatment of gastroesophageal varices can help us in treating variceal bleeding from the retroperitoneum. Therefore TIPSS can be usedmainly for the patient's postoperatory when there is suspicion of a newbleeding, or for diminishing the portal tension in selected patients serving asa bridge for liver transplantation. Before deciding if the TIPSS will beperformed, one must be aware of its contraindications and complications as bleeding,perforation of the liver capsule, and encephalopathy, among others.			
Bleedingintraperitoneal varix is a rare complication of portal hypertension, butcarries a high mortality rate. Nonetheless, the physician must know thiscondition, as the clinical suspicion is the only way of establishing an earlydiagnosis and indicating surgery at once, which is the only effectivetreatment.
Wesuggest a flowchart to optimize the treatment of the acute hemorrhagic abdomenin the cirrhotic patient. Paracentesis followed by ultrassonography with DuplexScan or Computerized Tomography seems to be the most important procedure forestablishing the correct diagnosis of abdominal pain, distention, and shock. Thereafter,surgery must be performed as soon as possible in case of ruptured varices. Arteriography should be used when the suspicion is of rupture of hepatocellularcarcinoma.
