RED CELL STROMA IN DOGS 

 Normal red blood cells in dogs contain stroma in fairly uniform amounts. This red cell stroma is rich in proteins and lipides. Anemia due to blood loss causes an increase in stroma protein. The highest levels of stroma protein are found in the severe anemias. As the anemia is corrected by red cell regeneration, the stroma protein level falls to normal. Anemia due to blood destruction (phenylhydrazine) presents very high levels of stroma proteinâ€”almost double the increase noted in anemia due to blood loss. Hypoproteinemia added to anemia due to blood loss causes no significant change on the stroma protein level. Abscesses due to the subcutaneous injection of turpentine during the anemia cause slight decreases in the stroma protein levels. Chloroform poisoning has no effect on the stroma protein levels. The total lipides of the stroma are rather stable and are little influenced by anemia. In certain experiments with hemolytic anemia and with hypoproteinemia, there is a significant rise in total lipide figures.
