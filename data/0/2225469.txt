A murine model of osteosarcoma was developed to investigate the association between the expression of VEGF and the progression of osteosarcoma. Two human osteosarcoma cell lines with distinct VEGF expressions were introduced into proximal tibiae of immuno-deficient SCID mice, either by direct injection through the cortical bone or surgical exposing and drilling on the tibial metaphysis to seed tumor cells. Bone tumors were obvious on microCT within 4 weeks following osteosarcoma cell inoculation through surgical delivery. In contrast, direct injection without drilling often resulted in periosteal tumors. Although neoplasms were developed regardless of VEGF levels, orthotopic tumors derived from high VEGF-expressing cells were detected 2 weeks earlier on CT images than the ones from VEGF negative cells. At sacrifice, high VEGF tumors were distinctively larger in size and more frequently invaded the adjacent bone tissue. Multiple metastatic lesions were found in all the lung tissues at 8 weeks from high VEGF group, whereas only 1 of 7 VEGF negative tumors exhibited pulmonary metastasis. Overall, this model developed with the surgical tumor cell delivery results in histological and radiographic features more consistent with primary osteosarcoma. Interestingly, VEGF expression correlates with the early establishment, rapid tumor growth, and the development of pulmonary metastasis.

Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bonetumor that usually affects adolescents and young adults. Multimodalitytreatment consisting of aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy and wide surgicalresection has markedly improved prognosis in osteosarcoma. However, nearly a half of the patients stillexperience therapeutic failures [1]. Treatment of patientswith osteosarcoma, especially those nonresponsive to current chemotherapyprotocols, remains a major challenge. Although the exact mechanisms of invasioninto adjacent tissues, the microcirculatory system, and lymphogenic orhematogenic dissemination with subsequent extravasation and formation ofsecondary tumor foci remain unclear, it appears that high metastatic potentialand recurrence rate are associated with promoted neovascularization [2]. Indeed, growth, invasion,and metastasis of solid tumors are dependent on neovascularization, which isregulated through angiogenesis [3]. The development of tumorangiogenesis is believed to be dependent on the net balance between the actionsof angiogenesis promoters and inhibitors. Proangiogenic factors are upregulatedin malignancy, and have been linked to poor prognosis with disease progression [4]. It appears that theproangiogenic factors within solid tumors stimulate host vascular endothelialcell mitogenesis and possibly chemotaxis. A large number of proangiogenicfactors have been identified, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta-1(TGFβ1), transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), and epidermal growth factor(EGF) [5]. Perhaps the bestcharacterized one is vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF), which is relatively unique among growth factors in terms of itsspecificity for the vascular endothelium [6]. Enhanced VEGF geneexpression has been identified in a number of malignant tumors from breast,lung, ovarian, liver, and colon in comparison with normal tissue [7]. However, there are fewstudies aimed at elucidating the correlation of VEGF expression and progressionof osteosarcoma. The objectives of the current study are to characterize amurine model of human osteosarcoma with distinct VEGF expressions to monitorVEGF expression in the development and progression of this most commonmalignant bone tumor.
Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice at four weeks of age wereobtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me, USA) and used as hostsfor the experimental sarcoma. The animals were housed in a pathogen-freeenvironment and given free access to autoclaved chow and water. All mice werequarantined for one week prior to experimentation.
Human osteosarcoma cell lines, G-292 (CRL-1423) and HOS (CRL-1543) cells wereobtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va, USA) andprocessed according to the vendor’s instruction. G-292 Cells were cultured inMcCoy’s 5a medium with 1.5 mM L-glutamine and 2.2 g/L sodium bicarbonate, whileHOS cells were maintained in MEM (Eagle) medium with 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 1.0 mM sodiumpyruvate. Both cell cultures also contained 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.Cells were incubatedat 37C° in a 5% CO2 incubator. Mediawere changed every 3 days. When 90% confluence was reached, culture medium wasremoved, the cell layer rinsed thoroughly with phosphate buffered saline (PBS),and enzymatically dissociated by adding 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-0.03% (w/v) EDTA.Cells were maintained by subculture at a ratio of 1 : 8. Prior to implantation,the cell suspensions were diluted with 0.5% (w/v) trypan blue in 0.16 mol/Lammonium chloride to assess cell viability and number.
Human VEGF levels in the culture mediumcollected from G-292 (CRL-1423) and HOS (CRL-1543) cell cultures were assessedusing Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D Systems) with a pair of rabbit anti-humanVEGF antibodies (R&D Systems) according to manufacture’s instruction andthe standardized protocol previously described [8].
The Institutional Animal Investigation Committee approved all animal procedures. SCID Mice were anesthetized by IPinjection of a mixture of Xylazine (8 mg/kg) and Ketamine (100 mg/kg). Twodifferent approaches were utilized to deliver the osteosarcoma cells to theright tibiae of the mice.
In the surgical exposuregroup, under strict sterile conditions, a 0.5 cm incision along the lateralcollateral ligament of the knee was made to expose the proximal of tibia. A 0.8 mm dental drill was used to drill a small hole across the metaphysis. The woundwas rinsed with PBS containing Penicillin G (500 unit/mL) and Streptomycin(500 μg/mL) before closing the skin cut by simple interrupted sutures. 100 μL ofculture medium containing 106 osteosarcoma cells (G-292 or HOS) wasinjected into the hole immediately after surgery. The other limb received asham operation without injection of tumor cells.
To compare with the surgicalgroups, mice were given a direct injection of 106 G-292 or HOS cellsthrough the cortical bones into the proximal tibial metaphysis using a 23 Gneedle, without the surgical procedures described above. All animals were monitored throughout thestudy with daily visual inspection for general health and tumor development. Acaliper was used to measure the leg dimensions to assess growth of the tumor.Animals were sacrificed at 6 and 8 weeks after tumor cells inoculation by CO2 asphyxiation.Legs containing orthotopic tumors, liver, and lungs were harvested forhistological and molecular evaluations.
An eXplore Locus MicroCT system (GE Medical Systems, London, ON,Canada) was used to monitor the tumor growth, characters of bone lesions, andlung metastasis. Mice were scanned immediately following tumor cellimplantations, and every 2 weeks thereafter.All mice were fully anesthetized (10 mg/kg of Xylazine and 120 mg/kg ofKetamine) and restrained during each CT scanning. Scan parameters were set at45 μm isotropic voxel size, 400 projections, 400 milliseconds exposure time, 80 KW voltages, and 450 μA current.
Proximal tibiae bearingosteosarcoma tissue and receiving sham operation were collected along with thelungs and liver at sacrifice. Tissues were fixed in buffered formalin,decalcified in EDTA (bone tissue), and embedded in paraffin at consistentorientation. The bone tumors in tibia were cut longitudinally and other tissueswere cut in multiple layers. All tissues were stained with hematoxylin andeosin, and examined under a Zeiss light microscope. Digital photomicrographswere captured and analyzed using Image-Pro Plus analysis software (MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, Md, USA).Tumor length and width were measured, and metastatic lesions wereevaluated.
IHCwas performed on primary orthotopic tumor sections to detect the expressionlevels of VEGF, Flt-1 (physiological receptor of VEGF), and CD31, according tothe instructions of the vender and theprotocol published previously [9]. Briefly, paraffin sections weredeparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in graded alcohols and water. 0.3%Hydrogen Peroxide was applied to diminish endogenous peroxidase followed bymicrowave incubation to enhance the antigen. After blocking with 1.5% normalgoat serum for 1 hour, the sections were incubated overnight with the primaryantibodies (2 μg/mL, BD, Pharmingen) in a moisturized chamber at 4C°. Biotin-conjugated secondary antibody andAvidin-biotin enzyme reagents were sequentially applied for 30 minutes betweenextensive washes. The color wasdeveloped by adding 3.3′-diaminobezidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB). In negative control sections, an irrelevantantiserum was applied at the same concentration as the primary antibody. Digital images were captured and analyzedusing the Image-Pro software package. The level of positive staining and localization was evaluated in sixdifferent fields and expressed as pixel density.
Primary osteosarcoma tissues including the adjacentbone were snapped-frozen in liquid nitrogen at the time of sacrifice. The tumortissues were ground into power while deep-frozen and a portion of thetumor-bone powder homogenized in 0.5 mL of Trizol solution (Gibco BRL) using aglass Grinder Pestle. Total RNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit(Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, Tex, USA) in accordance with the manufacturerinstructions. The precipitated RNA wasthen treated with DNase and passed through a spin column (Rneasy mini kit,Qiagen) for further purification. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR forthe expression of VEGF, c-myc, and c-fos was performed as described previously [10]. Briefly, cDNA was reverse transcribed from 0.5 μgof total RNA in 40 μL reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 500 μM each ofdeoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP), 0.5 U/μL of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 μM random hexamers, 5.5 mM MgCl2, and 1.25 U/μL of reverse transcriptase (Perkin Elmer, Conn, USA); and incubated in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer, Mass, USA) at 25C° for 10 minutes, 48C° for 5 minutes followed by 95C° for 5 minutes. For real-time PCRsteps, sense and antisense primer pairs were picked in “Primer3” software(http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi) and listed asfollows: VEGF 5′-AAGGAGGAGGGCAGAATCAT-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCATGGTGATGTTGGA-3′; c-myc 5′-GGTGGAAAACCAGGTAAGCA-3′ and5′-CCTTCTCCTCTGCCATCTTG-3′; c-fos 5′-AAGGAGAATCCGAAGGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGGGCCCTTATGCTCAATCT-3′. To standardize target gene level with respect to variability in RNA and cDNA quality, housekeep gene 18S was coamplified as an internal control. Reaction mixtures of 25 μLcontaining 12.5 μL of 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 400 μM dUTP, 1.25 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, 0.5 UAmpErase uracil N-glycosylase), 0.5 μL each of 0.4 μM target primers and 2 μL of cDNA. The PCR reactions were set in MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plateswith MicroAmp optical caps and amplified in the ABI Prism 7700 SequenceDetector (PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif, USA) for 40 cycles (95C°for 15 seconds, 60C° for 1 minute). The fluorescent signals were recordeddynamically. The values of thresholdcycle (Ct) at which a statistically significant increase in reporter-dyesignals (ΔRn) isfirst detected were imported into Microsoft Excel program and used to calculatethe relative quantification of the target gene expression. With the Ct value of18 S the samples as an internal control and mean Ct value of target geneexpression from the bone tissue of the sham operations as the calibratorsamples (named 0% expression change), the comparative gene expressions of theexperimental tumor groups over the sham controls were calculated according tothe formula given in the manufacturer’s manual [11].
A total of 40 mice wereused for this study with 2 premature deaths (anesthetics overdose, eliminatedfrom the study). Statistical analysis between different VEGF expressing tumorgroups was performed by Student t-test, or the ANOVA test; with theSchafer formula for post hoc multiple comparisons, using the SPSS softwarepackage (SPSS. Chicago, Ill, USA). A P value of less than .05 was considered as significant difference. Data areexpressed as mean ± standard error of the mean.
 ELISA was performed to determine VEGF expression levels in medium after 72 hours of cell culture. There were only trace levels of VEGF expressed in theculture media collected from the dishes of the HOS (CRL-1543) cells.However, the VEGF level in media of G-292 (CRL-1423) cells was over 27 times higher than the level detected inmedia of HOS cells during the same culture period of time.
Regardless of the VEGF expression,osteosarcoma cells from both lines induced orthotopic tumors in the upper tibiaregion of the SCID mice. Daily measurement of the legs for tumor growth intibia did not generate meaningful data until the late stage of thetumorigenesis, and no differences were observed between the two tumor cellslines (data not shown), possibly due to the incarcerated tumor expansion inbone tissues. On the other hand, the different methods of tumor cellinoculation resulted in varying growth patterns of the orthotopic tumors.Surgical exposure and drilling of the tibia promoted cell anchoring andresulted in intramedullary lesions (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Any surrounding soft tissue bulging was not obvious until 6 weeks after cell transplantation. Tumors establishedusing direct injection of osteosarcoma cells resulted in primary tumorsanchored to adjacentperiostea and grown away from the bone surface (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).
 MicroCT indicated that 6of 7 mice surgically implanted with G292 cells (high VEGF expression) developeddetectable bone tumors at 2 weeks after tumor cell inoculation, whereas the HOScells-(low VEGFexpression) derived tumors became detectable in microCT images at either 4weeks or 6 weeks after inoculation (P<.05). Periodical microCT scansdynamically monitored the development and growth of the primary tumor andproved a useful assessment technique in this study. Figure 2 reveals an exampleof the progression of the experimental osteosarcoma (G292 cells).
Histologyevaluation using a computerized image analysis system showed that the averagesizes (observed areas on sections) of the primary tumors derived from G292cells were 3.97±0.84×2.95±0.24 mm (length × width), significantly larger thanHOS experimental orthotopic tumors (1.85×1.34) mm at 8 weeks, the terminationpoint of the experiment (P<.05). In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed strong positive CD31(Figure 3(a)) and VEGF (Figure 3(c)) staining on G292 cell-derived orthotopic tumorsections, in comparison with the tumors from HOS cells (Figures 3(b) and 3(d)).
 RNA samples isolated from the orthotopic tumors were examinedfor the gene expression of VEGF, Flt-1, and both oncogenes c-fos and c-myc. Relative gene expressionsover the sham controls were calculated. Significant higher VEGF expression wascompanioned with elevated c-myc expression in G292-derived primary tumors(Figure 4).
Lungs and liver were collected and pathologically examinedfor tumor metastasis. No emerging metastatic lesions were identified in livertissues. However, all of the G292-experimental osteosarcoma mice sacrificed at8 weeks and 80% of the mice at 6 weeks developed extensive lung metastasislesions (Figure 5). In comparison, only 1 out of 7 HOS-tumor mice developed asimilar pulmonary change within the same time.
Thecurrent study establishes a mouse model of osteosarcoma by introducing humanosteosarcoma cells to the common disease site-proximal tibia-in immunedeficiency mice. Using two clonally unrelated human osteosarcoma cell lines, wetry to compares the correlation between VEGF expression and the development andprogression of osteosarcoma in this murine model. Osteosarcoma is an extremelyaggressive malignant tumor of the skeleton characterized by fast growth andearly hematogenic metastasis. It is postulated that the growth, invasion, andmetastatic potential of many solid tumors are dependent on angiogenesis mediated via thepotent proangiogenic factor VEGF. Clinical studies have shown that the densityof intratumoral microvessels correlates well with the grade of invasiveness,the frequency of metastasis, and clinical prognosis in many types of cancers [12, 13]. Malignancies have anabsolute requirement for a persistent supply of new blood vessels to nourishtheir growth and to facilitate metastasis. The angiogenic cascade leading totumor vascularization can be divided into two general phases, the prevascularphase and the vascular phase [5, 14]. Once tumor cells transforminto angiogenic phenotype, these malignant cells in avascular tumors becomecapable of inducing neovascularization, which permits a rapid rate of tumorgrowth and increases metastatic potential. The development of tumorangiogenesis is believed to be dependent on the elevated expression andpresence of active proangiogenic factors within the solid tumors that stimulatehost vascular endothelial cell mitogenesis and possibly chemotaxis [4]. VEGF (the most potent direct-actingproangiogenic protein known) is a diffusible endothelial cell-specific mitogen and an angiogenicfactor that also increases vascular permeability. It stimulates and maintainsneovascularization in a variety of tumor types [6]. In situ hybridization assays have shown a marked upregulation ofVEGF mRNA in many human tumors [15], and VEGF mRNA has been foundto be much more abundant in cancer cells than in endothelium, suggesting thatthe cancer cells themselves generate VEGF to induce angiogenesis through aparacrine loop. However, little is known about the role of angiogenesis andproangiogenic factors, such as VEGF, in the development and biologic activityof malignant bone tumors [16] though several clinicalstudies have found that many osteosarcoma patients with pulmonary metastasis hadprimary tumors with high levels of VEGF expression [17]. In this study, we utilized establishedosteosarcoma cell lines with distinct VEGF expressions to generate anexperimental orthotopic osteosarcoma mouse model. The data clearly show thatthe orthotopic tumors derived from high VEGF expressing osteosarcoma cells(G292) grew more rapidly and were more likely to metastasize to the lung by 6–8 weeks. In contrary, the experimental orthotopic tumors derived from low VEGF expressingcells were less inclined toward early pulmonary metastasis. The data provides aVEGF targeting osteosarcoma model to all further studies to understand the roleof VEGF in the pathogenesis, progress, and prognosis of the tumor.
With the recent expansion of molecularbiology techniques, genetic alterations, associated the development and metastasesof malignant tumors, have been observed. Cellular oncogenes have been found tobe activated by DNA rearrangements (proviral insertions, chromosometranslocations, and DNA amplifications). These alterations may result in anincreased or deregulated gene expression. Although numerous oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes have been identified in osteogenic sarcomas, c-myc and c-fos seem to be expressed with a relatively high incidence [18–22]. C-myc protooncogeneon chromosome 8 encodes transcription factor, which involves in the regulationof cell growth, DNA replication, and transcriptional regulation of specifictarget genes [23]. C-fos protooncogene,the cellular homologue of v-fos, is involved in osteoblast andchondrocytes differentiation [21]. Studies have indicated that c-myc and c-fos were found overexpressed in the relapse osteosarcoma and themetastasis cases [19]. In this G292 experimentalosteosarcoma model, these oncogenes, especially c-myc, markedly expressed in the tumor tissues supplementing withthe high VEGF expression.
To our knowledge, there are only a fewreports concerning experimental murine models of osteosarcoma [24, 25]. Luu et al. recently reported an orthotopic osteosarcoma model byinjecting three related human osteosarcoma lines (TE85, MNNG/HOS, and 143 B) toproximal tibia of athymic nude mice [25]. Coincidentally, the authorsused the N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) transformed HOSosteosarcoma cells in their model and found that the cells resulted intumorigenesis in primary injection site, but significant less pulmonarymetastasis compared to the other cell line (143 B). Since MNNG is known to create DNA strandbreakage, it is postulated that the mutagen may cause the genetic alterationand be responsible for the phenotypic difference in tumor growth and metastaticpotential [25]. We utilized the original HOScells in our model, and predictable primary tumors were established in uppertibiae of SCID mice. However, the pulmonary metastasis was not evident, inagreement with Luu’s findings [25]. One of the majorcharacteristics of HOS cells is their low expression of VEGF, that is, experimentalevaluations have been performing to test the hypothesis that the slowerneo-angiogenesis in primary tumors due to lack of VEGF contributes to thedelayed remote metastasis of osteosarcoma.
Kaya et al. [17] examined 27 human cases ofprimary osteosarcomas and evaluated the correlation between the expression ofVEGF and presence of microvessels, the clinical-pathological variables, and thesurvival of patients. Their investigation suggested that patients with VEGF-positiveosteosarcoma developed a significantly higher lung metastasis rate andtherefore a reduced chance of survival. It appears that antiangiogenic therapy,especially the blockade of VEGF effects may be a novel and potentiallypromising strategy for this common form of malignant tumor in orthopaedicsurgery. The VEGF-associatedosteosarcoma mouse model we are reporting here may provide a platform to screenpotential interventions, including antiangiogenic gene therapy, forosteosarcoma.
