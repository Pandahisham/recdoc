Alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking in relation to high frequency of p53 protein accumulation in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the Japanese

We investigated levels of p53 protein expression in Japanese patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. A significantly larger proportion of heavy alcohol drinkers and cigarette smokers was evident in the p53-positive group. The combination of drinking and smoking was associated with a high frequency of p53 protein accumulation. Â© 2000 Cancer Research Campaign
