Ameloblastic carcinoma: Sometimes a challenge


A 60-year-old male reported with pain and extraoral swelling in the left lower third of the face. Clinically, a 2 cm × 2 cm bony hard swelling was seen extending up to the left angle of the mandible. The swelling was tender on palpation, with no signs of parasthesia. Intraorally, the ulcer was 1 cm × 3 cm in size and showed white slough and and an indurated border. Radiographically, a diffuse radiolucency was seen.
Ulcerated mucosal surface with acute inflammation is seen, along with pleomorphic epithelial cells irregularly arranged in cords and nests [Figures 1 and 2].Moderate acute inflammation with keratotic debris is seen in the islands lined by tall columnar cells showing nuclear atypia and mitotic activity [Figures 3–7].Intervening stroma is vascular and shows dense lymphocytic infiltration.The islands of tall columnar cells show a high degree of pleomormhism and mitotic activity; the intervening stroma is vascular [Figures 8–13].

Conventional ameloblastoma does not show the same intensity of pleomorphism, whereas squamous differentiation in ameloblastoma resembling keratotic debris might be confused with squamous cell carcinoma.
The histopathological features are suggestive of ameloblastic carcinoma.
