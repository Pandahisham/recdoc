CLONAL MEMORY 

 A single clone of B cells producing anti-DNP antibody recognizable by the isoelectric-focusing spectrum has been used, in a double transfer system, to study clonal memory. Trasnsferable B memory develops between 4 and 7 days after the first transfer with antigen. B-memory cells thus proliferate before or concomitantly with antibody-forming cells.
