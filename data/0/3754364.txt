Epidemiological aspects of melanoma at a university hospital dermatologycenter over a period of 20 years*

The incidence of melanoma has been steadily rising in past decades. Although itaccounts for only 3% of all skin cancers, it is responsible for 75% of deaths.
to describe the epidemiological aspects of melanoma in a university hospitalsetting over a period of 20 years. 
A total of 166 patients were analyzed between January 1990 and January 2010 forclinical and histological variables and correlations between them. A 5% level ofsignificance was adopted. 
The majority of patients were Caucasians (74%), females (61%), with a mean age atdiagnosis of 55. The predominant histological type was lentigo maligna/lentigomaligna melanoma (35.7%) and the head and neck was the most affected site (30.7%).Among non-Caucasians, the acral region was the most affected. Most tumors were insitu (41.1%). Growth of the lesion was the most frequent complaint (58.1%) andbleeding was most frequently associated with melanomas with a depth > 4mm.There were seven deaths (4.2%), with a high risk among men, non-Caucasians andthose under 20 years of age, with a Breslow's depth > 2mm, with lentiginousacral melanoma and with a history of growth and bleeding. 
Our sample differs from most of the studies in the predominant location (head andneck), histological type (lentigo maligna/ lentigo maligna melanoma) and a majorrisk of death under the age of 20, which could be with a reflex of regionalvariation. Broader studies are necessary for validation of the results.
A incidência do melanoma cutâneo aumentou nas últimas décadas. Embora represente3% dos tumores cutâneos, é responsável por 75% dos óbitos. O diagnóstico precoceconstitui a principal chance de cura. 
Descrever os aspectos epidemiológicos do melanoma em hospital universitário em 20anos. 
Avaliaram-se 166 pacientes no período de janeiro de 1990 a janeiro de 2010,quanto s variáveis epidemiológicas, histológicas e óbitos relacionados ao melanomae suas correlações. Adotou-se nível de significância de 5%. 
A maioria dos pacientes era brancos (74%), mulheres (61%), com média de idade aodiagnóstico de 55 anos. O tipo histológico predominante foi o lentigomaligno/lentigo maligno melanoma (35,7%) e a localização mais frequente foi acabeça e o pescoço (30,7%). Entre os não-brancos, a região acral foi a maisacometida. Quanto espessura tumoral, a maioria dos melanomas era in situ (41,1%).O crescimento da lesão foi a queixa mais frequente (58%) e o sangramento foi maisassociado a melanomas espessos. Ocorreram sete óbitos (4,2%), com maior risco demorte em menores de 20 anos e naqueles com história de sangramento, após análisemultivariada. 
Esta casuística difere da maioria dos estudos em relação localização (cabeça epescoço), ao tipo histológico (lentigo maligno/lentigo maligno melanoma) e aomaior risco de óbito em menores de 20 anos, o que pode ser devido variaçãoregional. Estudos mais amplos são necessários para validação destesresultados.

The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM) has increased continuously in recent decadesaround the world.1 The highest rates,40 to 60 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, are found in Australia and NewZealand.2,3 In the USA, the incidence of CM rose from 8.7 to 26.5 per100,000 inhabitants from 1975 to 2007, an increase of 300%.4 In Brazil, the estimated incidence of CM for 2010,according to the National Cancer Institute (INCA) varies from 3.04 to 3.72 per 100,000men and 2.92 to 3.04 per 100,000 women, with the highest rates in the Southern region ofthe country.5
In recent years, survival rates have improved, probably due to earlierdiagnosis.3,5 Two thirds of all cases of CM diagnosed in the USAbetween 1988 and 1999 had a tumor thickness of < 1 mm, while the proportion of CM ≥ 2mm remained stable.6
Various environmental and constitutional risk factors are found to be associated withCM. Among the former, intermittent exposure to sunlight, especially that which resultsin burns accompanied by blisters during childhood, has been referred to as the mostrelevant.7,8 As for constitutional risk factors, of note are lighterphototypes (types I and II on the Fitzpatrick scale), congenital nevus, multipleacquired common or atypical melanocytic nevi, a personal and/or family history of CM,xeroderma pigmentosum, a personal history of other skin cancers andimmunosuppression.9,10
The more refined knowledge of the epidemiological and histological characteristics of CMmay be reflected in the approach taken towards it, especially favoring earlydiagnosis.
One hundred and sixty-six patients from the dermatology center at a university hospitalwere diagnosed with CM from January of 1990 to January of 2010. The sample was definedfor convenience.
The following clinical variables were analyzed: sex, age at diagnosis (< 20, 21-40,41- 60 and > 60), skin color (white and non-white), body location (head and neck,trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs, acral regions and others), atypical nevi (none, < 10and > 10), nonmelanoma skin cancer, non-cutaneous cancer, family history of CM,symptoms and/or signs (bleeding, itching, pain and burning sensation, changes in coloror size), metastasis and deaths.
The histological variables analyzed were: histological type (superficial spreadingmelanoma [SSM], nodular melanoma [NM], acral-lentiginous melanoma [ALM], lentigo maligna/ lentigo maligna melanoma [LM/LMM] and others), tumor thickness (insitu ≤1 mm, 1.01-2 mm, 2.01-4 mm and >4 mm) and the level ofinvasion or Clark level (in situ or I, II, III, IV and V).
A significance level of 5% was considered. The variables were compared based on theChi-squared test and Fisher Exact test.
The progression towards death was evaluated based on survival analysis techniques. Onlydeaths resulting from CM were considered. A univariate analysis was performed utilizingthe log-rank test and the multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox model.
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, and terms of free and informedconsent were duly collected.
In the sample assessed, 101 patients (61%) were women and 65 (39%) were men. The meanage at diagnosis was 55, with standard deviation of 18,2 years. The minimum age was oneyear and the maximum 92 years (Graph 1). Thesample consisted of 120 whites (74%) and 42 non-whites (26%).
Histogram of age at diagnosis
Regarding body location, 30.7% of the patients presented CM on the head and neck, 21.1%on the trunk, 19.3% in acral regions, 15.1% in the upper limbs and 9.6% on the lowerlimbs. In a comparison between genders, the men presented a higher proportion of MM onthe head and neck (35.3%), followed by the trunk (29.2%). Among the female patients, theextremities (upper and lower limbs) were the most frequent site (34.7%), followed by thehead and neck (27.7%). The women presented more affected areas on the lower limbs(13.9%) than the men (3.1%), while among men CM affected the trunk more (29.2%) thanamong women (15.8%). The white patients had a greater proportion of CM on the head andneck (35.9%), followed by the trunk (25.8%). Among non-whites, acral regionscorresponded to 50% of the cases (Table 1).

Among histological types, LM/LMM was found in 35.7% of the cases, followed by SSM in35.1%, ALM in 17.2% and NM in 6%. In a comparison respective to body locations, LM/LMMwas the most frequent histological type on the head and neck. ALM was present in 88.5%of the CM cases located in acral regions, while SSM was most common on the trunk(34%).
Correlated with skin color, the white patients presented a predominance of SSM (43.5%),followed by LM/LMM (35.2%). Among the non-whites, 40% presented with ALM, followed byLM/LMM (37.5%) (Table 2 and Graph 2).

Distribution of histological type by skin color
Roughly 20% of the patients had atypical nevi, with 16.5% presenting less than 10 and3.4% more than 10 such lesions.
A family history of CM was present in 16 (10%) of the patients.
Regarding tumor thickness, 41.1% were in situ, 31.1% presented a tumorthickness < 1 mm, 11.3% were between 1.01 and 2 mm and 9.9% were betweenn 2.01 and4mm, 6.6% were > 4 mm. In a comparison of histological types, LM/LMM was the mostfrequent among in situ CM or CM with a tumor thickness ≤ 1 mm (92.3%),followed by SSM (73.1%). There was no statistically significant difference in thecorrelations between tumor thickness and gender, skin color, age and body location(Table 3).

In relation to the Clark level, 42% of the patients presented at level 1 or insitu, 13% at level II, 20% at level III, 21% at level IV and 4% at level V.The LM/LMM histological type was the most common at Clark levels I and II (84%). Amongcases of level V CM, ALM was the most common histological type (11.5%) (Table 4).

Symptoms of and/or alterations in the primary lesion were reported by 96 (70.6%) of thepatients. Among these, the most frequent report was of growth of the lesion (58.1%),followed by alterations in color by 22%, alterations in sensitivity by 14.7% andbleeding by 5.2%. Darkening was the most common alteration in color, while itching wasthe most common symptom regarding sensitivity. Reports of bleeding were most common forClark levels IV and V (83.3%), along with tumor thicknesses > 4 mm (60%). Growth wasmost commonly reported for level I tumor invasions (50%). Alterations in sensitivity andcolor were associated with in situ and thin CM (Breslow's depth ≤ 1mm), with 61.1% and 63.3% of cases, respectively, but for the last two characteristicsthere was no statistical significance (Tables 3and 4).
Metastasis was detected in 19 (13.4%) patients. Lymph node metastasis was found in 12(40%) patients, cutaneous in seven (24%), cerebral in five (17%), lung in four (13%),blood in one (3%) and bone, also in one patient (3%).
There were seven deaths resulting from CM. We have included here patients with giantcongenital melanocytic nevi (GCMN) and xeroderma pigmentosum (PX). In the univariateanalysis, there was a greater chance of death for men, those under the age of 20,non-whites, those with a Breslow's depth > 2 mm, with the ALM histological type andwith a history of growth and bleeding. However, following the multivariate analysis,only those under the age of 20 and those with a history of bleeding continued to run ahigh relative risk of death, approximately 13 and eight times higher, respectively(Table 5).
Multivariate model - evolution to death
In countries with a lower incidence of CM, such as European countries and Brazil, themajority of cases occur among females and, in contrast, in countries with the highincidence, such as Australia, New Zealand and the USA, there is a predominance of thedisease among males or even equality in terms of gender distribution.2
In this study, 61% of the patients were female, which is in line with the majority ofstudies that have been conducted in Brazil.11-16
In relation to age, CM is characterized by its incidence among young people. The averageage at diagnosis is 52, which is 10 years less than what is reported for more commoncancers such as breast, lung and prostate cancer.17 In this study, a mean age of 55 years was found, which is inconsonance with Brazilian and international literature.11,13,14,18-20
Among risk factors for CM are phenotypical traits such as light or fair skin, hair andeyes, with studies indicating a risk of developing this neoplasm 10 times higher amongCaucasians than other ethnicities.9,10 In the Southern region of Brazil, themajority of studies deal with a population that is almost 100% white.12,15 In this study, 74% of the patients were white and 26% werenon-whites. This ratio of non-whites is higher than that found in the literaturestudied.11,16,21,22
Regarding histological type, the international literature reports that among whiteindividuals, SSM predominates, varying from 37.7% in Chile to 43.6% in Argentina, 60% inSpain, 62% in Switzerland and 73.6% in Australia.19,23-26 In studies involving non-white individuals, ALM is themost prevalent.10,27 Forman et al, in the USA, however, found that 56% of thecases were LM/LMM and speculated whether this difference in relation to other studies isdue to a change in risk factors or to a regional peculiarity.28
In the Brazilian literature, in the Southern region, where there is a prevalence ofpeople with a light skin tone, SSM vary from 35.3 to 68.9%.12,14,29-35 In other regions in Brazil, where there is a greater proportion ofnon-whites, the SSM percentage is lower.16,22 Fernandes etal found a predominance of LM/LMM (29.8%), as did the presentstudy.21 Despite the fact thatthe difference in proportion between LM/LMM (35.7%) and SSM (35.1%) found in this samplewas small, the frequency of LM/LMM is still higher than that reported in the literature(5 to 10%), just as SSM is less frequent when compared with studies in which a whitepopulation is predominant (70%).10 Thisdifference may be due to the frequency of non-whites found in this study (26%) andpossibly to sun exposure patterns, although this last variable has not beenmeasured.
In the current sample, SSM was most frequent on the trunk and on the extremities and ALMwas responsible for almost 90% of the MM in acral regions. LM/LMM was the most commonhistological type on the head and neck, which is in concordance with theliterature.1 A higher proportion of ALM wasfound (17.2%) and, once again, the most plausible explanation is the elevated frequencyof non-whites in this sample.
The most common body location varies with gender and with the histological type. In themajority of studies, CM occurs with greater frequency on men's dorsal area and onwomen's legs.10
In Brazilian literature, two studies11,33 found a predominance of CM on the head and neck,as was found in the present study.
The risk of CM is increased in the presence of atypical melanocytic nevi.10 Gandini and collaborators, in a meta-analysisstudy, highlighted that finding an atypical nevus increased the risk of CM by 2.4 times,while 10 or more atypical nevi increased the risk by 32 times.36 In the present study, approximately 20% of the patientspresented atypical nevi, which is a rate similar to that described in theliterature.12,37
The risk of CM is higher in patients that suffer from non-melanoma skin cancer,including basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous-cell carcinoma (SqCC), since all threeneoplasms are related to sun exposure.38 In thepresent study, the finding of 27,7% of the patients with a history of non-melanoma skincancer is higher than that found in the literature.39,40 One possible explanation would bethe chronic exposure to the sun, which may also explain the elevated frequency of CM onthe head and neck, even though this feature has not been evaluated by this study.
A family history of CM is an important risk factor. Patients with a history of CM8 among their relatives face a risk twice as high,while three or more family members with CM may result in a risk that is 35 to 70 timeshigher.10 A history of CM in the family wasobserved in 10% of the cases, which is similar to the rate described by the majority ofthe authors. 1,8-10,19,41
Breslow's tumor thickness is described in various studies as the most importantprognostic factor for CM.2,42
According to the most recent version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC),MMs are classified, based on Breslow's depth, as thin (≤ 1 mm), intermediate (1,01-4 mm)and thick (>4 mm).42 In recent years somepapers, from many areas of the world, have mentioned an increase in the incidence ofcases of thin CM, as well as the stabilization of the incidence of thick ones. 2,18,20,43Regarding the Brazilian literature, some authors have also found a high proportion ofcases of thin CM, which is, therefore, in concordance with the findings in theinternational literature.14,15,22,44
In the sampling presented here, 72% of the cases of CM were restricted to the epidermis(in situ) or had a tumor thickness of ≤ 1 mm. One possible explanationfor the predominance of CM in initial stages results from the diagnosis being made, inthe majority of cases, by dermatologists, which contributed to the early identificationof the tumor.45
The Clark level, or the tumor invasion level, was initially considered an independentprognostic factor. In the 2002 version of the AJCC's staging, this index was computed inorder to evaluate the prognosis of lesions with a Breslow's depth of < 1 mm.42 Now, the Clark level is considered in thestaging of thin CMs only when information on ulceration and the mitotic index is notavailable.42 In the present study, 55.1% ofthe patients presented Clark levels I and II, as found in the international literature,which reveals the predominance of lesions with lower invasion levels.20,46
Changes in color and size of a previous lesion and the appearance of a new lesion arethe earliest characteristics that are noted by patients and that contribute to thediagnosis. Of these, growth has been highlighted as the most frequent clinical sign,followed by alterations in color.19,24,47 Whilein some studies growth has been associated with greater tumor thickness, in another thisassociation was not detected.19,24,47
Alterations in color have been related to thinner CM and bleeding from thickerlesions.19,24,47 There is disagreement betweenauthors regarding alterations in sensitivity, especially itching. For some, this iscorrelated with thin tumors while others associate it with thicker ones.10, 19,24,47 In thisstudy, 70.6% of the patients reported symptoms and/or signs in the lesion. The mostcommon complaint was growth of the lesion, followed by darkening, itching and, lessfrequently, bleeding. This bleeding was associated with cases of thicker CM and wassimilar to the findings of the studies mentioned.19,24,47
Alterations in color, sensitivity and growth were more frequent in cases of thinner CM,though with no statistical significance.
Metastases denote a poor prognosis, with survival times estimated in months. As a rule,the greater the thickness of the tumor, the greater the chances of metastasis.46 Cases of CM diagnosed with a Breslow's thickness< 1.5 mm show 10-year survival rates above 90%.48 The CM disseminates via lymphatic and/or hematogenic routes. The formeroccurs very early in the evolution of CM. Distant metastases may be either non-visceral(skin, subcutaneous tissue and nonregional lymph node), or visceral, most frequentlyaffecting the lungs (18- 36%), followed by the liver (1420%), brain (12-20%), bones(11-17%) and gastrointestinal tract (1-7%).10
In the sample assessed, metastases were found in 19 (13.4%) patients, with the lymphnodes being the most common (40%). In 80% of the patients suffering from a metastasizeddisease, the tumor thickness was > 1.5 mm, which is similar to the findings from theliterature referred to above.
In addition to tumor thickness, other factors associated with survival rates are: sex,age, primary body location, histological type, skin color and staging.10
The men presented a higher proportion of cases of thick CM than the women, resulting inworse survival rates.3,15,18,24 Patients over the age of 60 also had poor prognoses with anelevated proportion of cases of thick CM. 3,18,49 Balchet al recorded that, even when controlling confusing factors such asgender and tumor thickness, age was an independent prognostic factor in CM.46 This may be attributed to a decline in theimmunological response which occurs withage.46,49
Regarding body location, the majority of the authors consider the trunk to be thelocation with the poorest prognosis.3,15,18,25,47 Inrelation to the histological type, some investigations have observed worse survivalrates with NM15,18 while others have recorded that ALM was associated with a poorerprognosis.47
As for skin color, Chang et al recorded worse survival rates fornon-white individuals both in the initial and later stages, though this association didnot have an impact on the multivariate analysis.18
In this sample a greater chance of death was found among men, those under the age of 20,nonwhites, those with the ALM histological type, those with a Breslow's depth > 2 mmand those with a history of growth and bleeding. However, following the multivariateanalysis, only the patients under the age of 20 and with a history of bleeding remainedat high risk.
Children and adolescents suffer from CM less frequently than adults, which may delaydiagnosis, thereby worsening survival rates.10,41,50 The two cases diagnosed in children occurred in patients bearing GCMN,which is known to carry a poor prognosis, since two thirds of cases of CM in people withGCMN are of a non-epidermic origin, which leads to a late diagnosis and, consequently,reduced survival rates.41
Bleeding is most common in cases of thick CM according to the literature and to theresults found in this study, which denotes a poor prognosis.19,24,47
In conclusion, in this sample, cases of CM were more common in women, with a mean age of55 years at diagnosis. Whites represent the majority of patients, but the proportion ofnon-whites is bigger than other Brazilian states, justifying the higher frequency of ALMthan cited in other studies. The most frequent histological type was LM/LMM, that couldbe because of regional factors and matches with predominant location. Comparing sex andbody site, CM was more common in trunk of men and limbs of women. In agree with nationaland international tendencies, the majority of CM was in situ or thin.The number of deaths was small, with more chances of dying in those under 20 years andwith a history of bleeding, after a multivariate analysis. In that way, more attentionshould be taken to children and teenagers, mostly those with predisposing factors suchGCMN, PX and atypical nevus, besides CM in these population being rare, the diagnosis ofCM with less than 1 mm of growth, is still the best chance of cure for the most lethaltype of skin cancer.
This sample analyzed is small and came from a single institution, meaning that thesefindings cannot be generalized for the entire population of the state. This data may notreflect the reality of CM among the population of this state. Further studies arenecessary in order to validate the results obtained. However, this study represents thelargest sampling of patients with melanoma in this state, with data collected over thelongest period of time.
