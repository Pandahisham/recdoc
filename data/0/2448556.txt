Acute pancreatitis as a cause of sudden or unexpected death in Northern Ireland.

Utilising incomplete data supplied by the Hospital Inpatient Analysis, the annual incidence of acute pancreatitis in Northern Ireland was estimated to be about 170 cases per million population. The annual mortality rate for the years 1974-1983, using figures obtained from the Registrar-General for Northern Ireland, was 12.3 cases per million. An increase in both incidence and mortality from acute pancreatitis was demonstrated during the study. There was 191 deaths from pancreatitis during the study period and in 27 of these the diagnosis was made only at postmortem examination. Of the undiagnosed fatalities, 10 occurred in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse. Eight of the 27 undiagnosed cases had not sought medical attention, five had presented with a systemic complication of acute pancreatitis, and a further five had only minor gastrointestinal tract symptoms prior to death. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires a high index of suspicion and should be considered in acutely ill patients, particularly those with a history of alcohol abuse, who fail to respond to appropriate therapy.
