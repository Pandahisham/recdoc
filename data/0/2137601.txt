PROPERTIES OF GUINEA PIG 7S ANTIBODIES 

 Guinea pig 7Sγ1 antibodies were demonstrated to mediate passive systemic or cutaneous anaphylaxis; guinea pig 7Sγ2 antibodies were unable to mediate these reactions. Gamma-2 antibodies specifically inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylactic reactions provoked by gamma-1 antibodies by competing for antigen. However, gamma-2 antibodies were unable to inhibit passive cutaneous sensitization of guinea pigs by a heterologous antibody system. Guinea pig 7Sγ2 antibodies appear to lack receptors for fixation to guinea pig tissues and do not compete with sensitizing antibody for receptor sites.
