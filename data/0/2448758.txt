Admission of nursing home patients to geriatric medical wards.

Comparison was made between patients admitted from a nursing home and all other patients admitted to a geriatric medical unit in 1990 and 1993. The number of nursing home patient admissions rose from 26 in 1990 to 106 in 1993. Nursing home patients were frailer both physically and mentally with a dementia rate of 78% (in those who survived, 1993) and a mortality rate of 19.8% (1993), compared with a dementia rate of 19% and a mortality rate of 11.3% in all other admissions in 1993. Male patients admitted from a nursing home were more likely to die than females (33% versus 14.5%, 1993). Lengths of stay of nursing home patients were shorter, largely due to the availability of a 'safe environment' when discharged, but also related to shorter survival times. 61% of patient admissions from nursing homes in 1993 were considered 'unnecessary' and could have been avoided if specialist advice had been available before admission.
