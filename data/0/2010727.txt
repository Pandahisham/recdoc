Elevated levels of prolactin in nulliparous women.

Follicular-phase (Day 11) plasma prolactin, and plasma and urinary oestrogen levels of 70 nulliparous nuns were compared with those of 80 of their sisters, of whom 62 were parous. The nuns and their nulliparous sisters did not differ significantly in their prolactin and oestrogen levels. No differences in plasma oestrogens or urinary oestriol ratio were found between the parous and the nulliparous women. However, the mean prolactin level of the nuns and their nulliparous sisters was 35% higher than that of the parous women in the sample taken approximately 1 3/4 h after rising (p less than 0.0005), and 24% higher (P less then 0.01) in the 2nd sample taken 2 h later. The elevation was independent of age, weight, and age at menarch√©. Age at first full-term pregnancy, at least up to the age of 30, and second or subsequent full-term pregnancies had no further effect on prolactin level. This study suggests that the effect of early first full-term pregnancy in lowering breast cancer risk may be mediated, at least in part, by permanently lowering the level of circulating prolactin.
