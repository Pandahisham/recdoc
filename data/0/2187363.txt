Treatment of (NZB x NZW)F1 disease with anti-I-A monoclonal antibodies

(NZB x NZW)F1 mice spontaneously develop an autoimmune syndrome characterized by a fatal immune complex glomerulonephritis. Administration of monoclonal antibodies specific for an I region gene product (I-Az) of the H-2 haplotype associated with susceptibility to glomerulonephritis in these animals produced a remission in female mice with established renal disease. The results demonstrated that anti-I-A therapy stabilized the level of proteinuria and increased the 1-yr survival rate from 10% to greater than 90% in treated animals relative to control mice. These findings may ultimately have therapeutic potential for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
