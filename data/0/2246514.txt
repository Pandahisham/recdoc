Long-term survival experience of female patients with genital cancer.

Survival analyses of patients with cancer of the cervix uteri, corpus uteri or ovary registered at Cambridge in 1960-1979 show that, although the long-term survivors had mortality rates similar to those of a normal age-matched population and might therefore be considered 'statistically cured', their risk of dying from their original cancer was still much higher than normal. Death rates from other cancers were slightly increased in cervix patients but not in corpus and ovary. At all three sites there was no evidence that deaths from non-malignant causes were increased. Only in cancer of the ovary was survival significantly better for patients registered in 1970-1979 than for patients registered in 1960-1969.
