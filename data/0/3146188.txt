Research on antidepressants in India

Data suggests that antidepressants are useful in the management of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, impulse control disorders, enuresis, aggression and some personality disorders. Research focusing on the usefulness of antidepressants in India has more or less followed the trends seen in the West. Most of the studies conducted in India have evaluated various antidepressants in depression. In this article, we review studies conducted in India on various antidepressants. The data suggests that antidepressants have been evaluated mainly in the acute phase treatment and rare studies have evaluated the efficacy in continuation phase treatment.

Antidepressants as a class of drugs are used primarily in the management of depressive disorders and anxiety disorders. However, this class of drugs is also used for the management of sexual dysfunction, eating disorders, impulse control disorders, enuresis, aggression and some personality disorders.
Over the years many classes of antidepressants have become available in India, some of which have stood the test of time and are still in use and some, which are no more marketed or are no more a favorite of clinicians. The research focusing the usefulness of antidepressants in India has more or less followed the trends in the west; however, some of the antidepressants drugs which have been marketed have not been evaluated as thoroughly as others.
Most of the studies done in India have evaluated various antidepressants in depression. There are very few studies which have evaluated antidepressants in conditions other than depressive disorders. In this article, we review studies done in India on various antidepressants. The review shall focus on the research published in Indian Journal of Psychiatry and studies reported in PubMed indexed journals on efficacy, effectiveness, usefulness and tolerability issues of antidepressants in human subjects.
The trials done to evaluate the efficacy of antidepressants can be divided into studies evaluating an antidepressant (no comparator studies), efficacy of an antidepressant with placebo as a comparator, comparing efficacy of 2 active drugs and those evaluating the efficacy of antidepressants with other modalities of treatment like electro-convulsive therapy or psychological treatment.
A total of 18 open trials without a comparator group have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of various antidepressants [Table 1].[1–18] Studies done in the 1960s evaluated the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants. Later studies have evaluated the efficacy of nitroxazepine, centpropazine, amineptine, tianeptine, sertraline and milnacipran. Studies done prior to 1990s have not used any standardized rating scales, most of these also did not mention the diagnostic criteria used for the diagnosis. These studies included subjects diagnosed with various subtypes like reactive depression, endogenous depression, psychoneurotic depression, melancholic depression etc. However, the studies done after 1990s have recruited subjects diagnosed on the basis of DSM or ICD-10 RDC criteria and used standardized rating scales to evaluate the efficacy or effectiveness. The sample sizes of the studies have varied a lot, most of the earlier studies included less than 50 subjects; however, some of the recent studies have included more than 300 subjects. Most of these trials have evaluated the outcome after six weeks. All these trials have shown that various tricyclic antidepressants, nitroxazepine, centpropazine, amineptine, tianeptine, sertraline, escitalopram and milnacipran are efficacious in treatment of depression. The trial which evaluated the efficacy of sertraline also showed that treatment of depression with sertraline leads to reduction in cardiac events post myocardial infarction.[13] A recently published trial, which evaluated the efficacy of milnacipran, included subjects who had suffered from stroke.[18] It is also one of the few trials which have included subjects more than 65 years of age. The trial done by Margoob et al.[17] in addition to the efficacy of escitalopram, have also shown that gene polymorphism plays an important role in the treatment response to various antidepressants.

Six placebo controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants in depression [Table 2].[19–24] Four of these trials have been double blind controlled trials,[19–22] one recruited subjects by consecutive sampling,[23] and one followed cross over design.[24] The duration of these trials has varied from four to eight weeks and these have included 16 to 96 subjects. Of the five trials, one evaluated the efficacy of imipramine in depressive symptoms in schizophrenia[24] and another included subjects with endogenous depression only.[23] Five of these trials showed that amitriptyline, imipramine, protriptyline and trimipramine are better than placebo in the management of depression;[19–23] however, the trial which evaluated the efficacy of imipramine for depressive symptoms in schizophrenia showed negative findings.[24]

There have been 18 trials which have compared two antidepressants.[25–41] One trial compared amitriptyline with amitriptyline and trifluperazine combination[42] and one trial compared amineptine vs. amineptine with benzodiazepine.[43] In another trial nortriptyline was compared with nortriptyline plus fluphenazine [Table 3].[44] The duration of these trials have varied from 10 days to five months; however, most of these have been of four to six weeks duration. Sample size has also varied considerably ranging from 20 to 425 and only four trials have included 100 or more subjects. In terms of study design, 10 trials have followed double blind controlled design; five of these also followed adequate randomization. One trial followed single blind randomized control design and another three trials were open randomized controlled trials. Earlier trials used mixed group of depressive subjects, whereas, recent trials have included subjects with major depressive disorder only. All the trials have used standard doses of antidepressants.
Active comparator group drug trials of efficacy/effectiveness of antidepressants in depressive disorders
14/20 (70%), showed good response to depressive symptoms, with 8 reporting complete relief of symptoms. Results were better when TFP was added (75% Vs 66)

On t test- neither at day 0 nor at days 28 and 42 was any significant difference seen in the mean scores of any of the Hamilton’s scale Sx between the two drug groups.
There was no difference in the frequency of observed clinical side-effects between the two groups of subjects
S/E of severe intensity were seen only with IMN
At 4 weeks, 16 subjects (80%) recovered with TIMN as compared with 14 subjects(70%) with IMN. There was no effect in 4 subjects with TIMN and 6 subjects with IMN and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups
At 6 weeks total number of improved cases remained the same in both group and none of the case worsened
Commonest S/E with TIMN were giddiness, weakness, difficulty in walking, drowsiness and dryness of mouth
69% of cases treated with STL showed a good response, i.e. reduction in total global score by 50% or more in comparison to only 40.9% of cases treated with IMN responded favorably and this difference was significant
In the subgroup analysis it was seen that90% of subjects in STL showed good response in comparison to only 30% in the IMN group
There were 5 instances of S/E with STL and 13 with IMN
In the IMN group, 7 subjects complained of severe S/E and hence the treatment had to be stopped during the first week in5 and in the third week in 2
Only FPZ group showed 63% reduction in HDRS and NTP 20 mg/day group showed 47% reduction in HDRS with other groups falling between the above2 groups. However, the difference in mean reduction between the treatment groups is not statistically significant
Headache, dizziness, body pains and burning sensation were commonly complained of by subjects in all the groups. These complaints were more numerous and intense in those who showed poor response to treatment.
Mean percentage reduction in total HDRS score was more with DTP than with IMN throughout the treatment period, though there was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of overall response and in the response of target Sx
S/E encountered were mild, more in IMN group (dryness of mouth and constipation) than DTP (ataxia and giddiness)
There was more than 75% improvement in total HDRS score in 80% of subjects treated with NTZ as compared to 35% subjects receiving DXN
NTZ was found more effective in controlling self reproach and guilt feelings, agitation and social withdrawal
None of the subjects on NTZ reported any unwanted or undesirable effects, while one fourth subjects treated with DXN had side-effects like dryness of mouth, giddiness and drowsiness
There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of reduction in total Hamilton scores

Of the 21 trials, 18 have assessed the outcome of depression at the end of trial on Hamilton depression rating scale. Findings from these trials suggest that imipramine is superior to Nialmide,[25] phenelzine,[25] Go 2998,[24] Go 2330[26] and moclobemide[37] in the treatment of depression. Antidepressants like noveril,[27] iprindole,[28] trimipramine,[29] dothiepin[31] and centpropazine[34] have efficacy similar to imipramine. Imipramine has been found to be inferior to sintamil.[30] The study which evaluated amitriptyline and trifluperazine combination showed that it was no better than amitriptyline alone.[42] Interestingly, the study which used fluphenazine found it to be as efficacious as nortriptyline.[44] Nitroxazepine has been shown to be better than doxepin in treatment of depression.[32] The amineptine trial, didn’t present data with regard to comparison in efficacy between the various groups of medications.[43] The studies which have compared various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have shown that these are equally effective, except for one which showed that citalopram was better than sertraline.[41] The only trial done on mirtazapine suggests that it is better than amitriptyline.[35] Studies have also shown that citalopram[38] and tianeptine[11] are as efficacious as amitriptyline. The trial by Badyal et al.[39] suggests that duloxetine is as efficacious as venlafaxine in the treatment of major depression. One of the recent multicentric trials have shown that escitalopram is superior to investigational drug LY2216684.[41]
Active Comparator Group (non-pharmacological treatment/electroconvulsive therapy) Trials of Efficacy/Effectiveness.
One study has compared the usefulness of antidepressants with respect to non pharmacological treatment[45] and two studies have compared antidepressants with electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of depression.[4647] Another study compared antidepressants with both electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and non-pharmacological treatment [Table 4].[48]
Active comparator group non-drug trial of efficacy of antidepressants in treatment of depressive disorders
Clinically, drug therapy was found to be more effective and economical.
However, PPT was effective in relieving the anxiety and depression as well as improving social adjustment. Drug therapy was effective only in the relief of depression.
Both treatments produced equally significant improvement which was maintained till the end of 6 months.
ECT produced its effects quicker.
Subjects who received ECT reported lesser subjective S/Es.
Rates of remission (HRSD < 8) in ECT and IMN group were 71 % and 78% respectively.
No significant difference in the two groups on HDRS, MADRS, CGI and BDI.
S/E scores at 2 and 4 weeks were lower in ECT group.
No significant difference in 3 groups with regard to reductions in the total scores on BDI and HDRS.
Remission (HDRS < 7) at the end of the trial - 93%, 73% and 67% in the ECT, IMN and SKY groups, respectively.
No clinically significant S/Es observed.
AMT - Amitriptyline; CDP - Chlordiazepoxide; PPT - Psychophysiological therapy; DBRCT - Double Blind randomized Controlled Trial; HDRS - Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; IMN - Imipramine; ECT - Electro Convulsive Therapy; S/Es - Side-effects; RCT - Randomized Controlled Trial; MDD: Major Depressive Disorder; MADRS - Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; CGI - Clinical Global Improvement scale; BDI - Beck’s Depression Inventory; SKY - Sudarshan kriya; AD - Antidepressants
One of these studies has shown that pharmacotherapy is more effective and more economical than non-pharmacological treatment.[45] However, one study showed no difference between ECT, antidepressant and Sudarshan kriya in the management of depression over the period of three weeks.[48] The studies which compared ECT with imipramine didn’t find any difference in efficacy between the two;[4647] however, Gangadhar et al. reported quicker response with ECT compared to imipramine.
Seven trials have evaluated the different dosing schedules for treatment of depression.[49–56] These studies suggest that parenteral imipramine is better than oral imipramine and possibly the onset of action is also earlier.[49] Studies have evaluated single dosing versus multiple dosing have shown no difference in efficacy[50–525455] except for one study, which showed that single dose nitroxazepine was better than divided doses.[53]

Chakrabarti and Kulhara[5758] evaluated the antidepressant prescription pattern in a tertiary care hospital for management of depression during acute and continuation phase. For the evaluation of prescription pattern during the acute phase, case notes of 108 cases fulfilling the ICD-10 criteria of depression or recurrent depression (F32 and F33) were examined. Imipramine was the most commonly prescribed antidepressants followed by Fluoxetine. The authors also observed that pharmacotherapy was often deficient in several areas such as, starting doses, rate of increase in dose, maximum doses used, dose titrations, duration of treatment, change of drugs, recording of side-effects and compliance etc. Results regarding norms for adequate doses and periods of treatment before switching drugs, for the kind of subjects included in this study, were unclear. Regarding the continuation phase treatment, the authors observed that it was deficient in about a third (n = 24; 34 %) of the cases, on either of the two parameters i.e., dose of drugs or duration of treatment and the outcome was poorer in those treated inadequately.
One double blind controlled trial has evaluated the efficacy of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD and showed that clomipramine was superior to placebo in the management of OCD.[59] This study also showed that male subjects showed better response than female subjects. Another study evaluated the efficacy of clomipramine in late onset OCD with comorbid Parkinsonism and showed that clomipramine can be used in elderly subjects and in the presence of Parkinsonism.[60] A small open label study evaluated the usefulness of neuroleptic and fluoxetine combination for treatment of obsessive compulsive (OC) symptoms occurring during the course of schizophrenia and showed that addition of fluoxetine leads to significant improvement in OC symptoms.[61]

5 out of 10 subjects showed 100% improvement, 3 showed 75% improvement, 1 showed 50% improvement and 1 showed 40% improvement in YOBCS
74% subjects in TIMN group and 63% subjects in NZM group responded favourably and difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant. Subjects displaying depression and anxiety responded better to TIMN
Dryness of mouth seen only in TIMN group
IMN and DPM were found to be equally effective (62.8% vs 62.2%) in reducing anxiety in all subjects. IMN was significantly better than DPM in reducing the level of depression in the depressed group but as effective as DPM in the other two groups.
IMN was significantly better for the symptoms of ‘depressed mood’ and ‘retardation’, while DPM was better for Sx of ‘fears’.
Not mentioned
Both the groups showed significant improvement after the 6-week trial and the addition of IMN to CPZ therapy did not have any advantageous or deleterious effect
IMN treated group did not exhibit more S/E than the group receiving PLB
Treatment completion rates were higher with FLX and least with the IMN 150 mg/day
Anticholinergic SEs and giddiness were common in the IMN groups; headaches and restlessness were common in the FLX group
Psychiatric outcome was significantly better with FLX than with PLB at 2 months, but not over the2-12 month period
AD were significantly more cost effective than PLB in the short term and long term (P < 0.05)
Psychological treatment was not more effective than PLB for any outcome during either period
All 38 subjects (25-65.7% 5 good, 13-34.2% 5 fair) belonging to yoga and 25 out of30 of the FLX group (82.3%) showed statistically significant improvement in PME
Commonly reported S/E of FLX- nausea, insomnia, vomiting, anxiety

One study evaluated the efficacy of antidepressants in insomnia and showed that trimipramine was similar to nitrazepam for treatment of insomnia, especially in the presence of anxiety and depression; however, it had poor tolerability as compared to nitrazepam.[62]
One trial included subjects with generalized anxiety disorder, mixed anxiety depression and dysthymia and showed that imipramine was as effective as diazepam for anxiety symptoms and better than diazepam for the depressive symptoms.[63]
One trial used imipramine in combination of chlorpromazine and compared it with chlorpromazine alone in the treatment of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia and didn’t find any benefit of adding imipramine to chlorpromazine in the treatment of treatment of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia.[64]
Two studies have also studied the usefulness of antidepressants in common mental disorders. One study showed that treatment completion rates were higher with fluoxetine than imipramine.[65] The trial by Patel et al.[66] included subjects with common mental disorders and evaluated the outcome at one year. It can be considered the longest study which has evaluated the effectiveness of antidepressant in Indian subjects.
Various sexual side-effects of antidepressants have been utilized for the management of sexual dysfunction. In a recently published open trial Dhikav et al.[67] compared fluoxetine with yoga for the management of premature ejaculation. The study included 68 subjects, of whom 38 were in the yoga group and 30 subjects in the fluoxetine group. All 38 subjects (25-65.7% 5 good, 13-34.2% 5 fair) of yoga group and 25 out of 30 of the fluoxetine group (82.3%) had statistically significant improvement in premature ejaculation and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant too. In an open clinical study, Prusty and Rath (2000)[68] found clomipramine effective in nocturnal emission. In another open trial, Prusty et al. (2003)[69] found clomipramine 5 mg along with Sildenafil 50 mg was successful in preventing premature ejaculation of 18 men who had erectile dysfunction also.
Two studies have evaluated imipramine for management of enuresis in children.[7071] In one of these trials,[71] in addition to enuresis, children had other behavioral abnormalities too. These studies have shown that imipramine is useful for management of enuresis and also for behavioral problems like obstinacy and temper tantrums. It was further seen that compared to subjects with mental retardation, the response to imipramine was better in children with average intelligence.
Studies evaluating the efficacy of imipramine in childhood onset disorders
Good response (<1 week) - 4 cases
Delayed response (2-4 weeks) -14 cases
No response - 2 cases
Abandoned - 2 (1-S/E; 1- otherwise)
58 of the 75 completed the trial
At 4 weeks - 46% of enuretic subjects recovered completely, 21% partially and 32% had no improvement
At 12 weeks - complete recovery - 68%; partial - 8%; no recovery - 24%
Recovery more in subjects with mild enuresis at the beginning
At 12 weeks - in obstinacy and temper - 53% favorable response, 47% - no improvement
Better response in intellectually average group (73%); compared to mentally retarded children (52%)
Besides the above studies, case series and case reports have also shown usefulness of antidepressants in the management of trichotillomania with trichobezoar,[72] Atypical bulimia Nervosa,[73] Skin Picking,[74] Persistent developmental stuttering,[75] primary hypersomnia,[76] cognitive functioning in depression,[77] proctalgia fugax with dysthymia,[78] palmar-plantar hyperhidrosis,[79] severe resistant depression[80] etc. One open label study also evaluated the usefulness of sertraline in chronic tension type headache and showed that sertraline leads to significant reduction in mean analgesic intake per week, but there is no difference in reduction of headache index and frequency of headache.[81]
Usefulness of antidepressants (findings from case reports/case series/descriptive studies)
As is evident from Tables 1 to 6, tricyclic antidepressants are poorly tolerated compared to the newer antidepressants. Additionally, there are multiple case reports implicating various antidepressants for induction of hypomania/mania,[87–96] hyponatremia/Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH),[97–99] extrapyramidal symptoms,[100] acute colonic (pseudo) obstruction (Ogilvie syndrome),[101102] psychosis,[103] hypertension,[104] vascular headache,[105] torsades de pointes,[106] alopecia,[107] cardiogenic shock,[108] seizures,[109110] galactorrhoea,[111] mania on withdrawal of antidepressants,[112] upper gastrointestinal bleeding,[113] bleeding gums,[114] serotonin syndrome[116117] etc [Table 9].

Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of antidepressants in depression and have shown that most of the currently marketed antidepressants are useful. In addition, studies also suggest usefulness of antidepressants in generalized anxiety disorder, dysthymia and common mental disorders. Many of the recent studies have been of good design and have followed double blind randomized controlled design and had reasonable sample size. Further, several studies have been carried out at multiple sites throughout the country. The available data also suggest that antidepressants are more cost-effective than other modalities of treatment for depression.
In addition, there is some evidence to suggest the usefulness of clomipramine in OCD and that of fluoxetine in management of OC symptoms in schizophrenia. However, some major limitations of the research have been that almost all the data available in relation to treatment of depression pertains to acute phase treatment and rarely studies have evaluated the continuation phase treatment. There is also lack of data with regard to the efficacy and effectiveness in the maintenance phase treatment. Surprisingly, no study has evaluated the efficacy/effectiveness of SSRIs in the management of OCD.
There is a need to conduct studies to evaluate the usefulness of antidepressants in the management of panic disorder and depression in medically ill subjects. Studies are also required to evaluate the efficacy of SSRIs in the management of OCD, and to study the usefulness of polypharmacy in the management of depression and other disorders. Studies are few and sparse and there is a need for multi-centric studies in such a vast country.
