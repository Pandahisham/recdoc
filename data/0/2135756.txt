RENAL EFFECTS OF HEMOGLOBIN INFUSIONS IN DOGS IN HEMORRHAGIC SHOCK

 The immediate effects of treating hemorrhagic shock in dogs by replacing lost blood with 7 per cent hemoglobin solution were favorable, both on renal function and on general condition. However, subsequent transitory depression of the urea clearance for several days, shown by some of the treated animals, but not by untreated bled controls, indicates sufficient possibility of renal damage by the hemoglobin solution to prevent its recommendation at present as a blood substitute.
