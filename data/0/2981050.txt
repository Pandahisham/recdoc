PALMAR FLEXION CREASE IN MALE SCHIZOPHRENICS AND THEIR FIRST DEGREE RELATIVES

132 male schizophrenics who met APA-DSM III criteria for the diagnosis of Schizophrenia were selected. They were further subclassified into subtypes. 73 healthy normal males and 60 first degree male relatives of patients were also taken into study. They were matched for palmar flexion crease pattern. Few sub-types only differed from normals, hence heterogeneity in Schizophrenia has been noted. Implications of findings has been discussed and need for further investigation is highlighted.
