Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an EBV-associated tumour not significantly influenced by HIV-induced immunosuppression. The AIDS/Cancer Working Group.

We used a link between cancer (859,398 reports) and AIDS (50,050 reports) registries in the United States to study whether nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was increased in the population with AIDS. There was no indication of a significantly increased risk up to or after the AIDS diagnosis, which argues against progressively failing immunity being important in the development of this malignancy.
