SERUM CHANGES AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN EXPERIMENTAL PANCREATITIS 

 1. The serum changes observed during acute experimental pancreatitis indicate that the shock and death are due to an intoxication from protein split products, and not to an intoxication from pure tryptic ferment. 2. When the pancreatitis is produced by the injection of an anti-proteolytic substance (sodium oleate), the degree of intoxication bears no relation to the degree of tissue destruction. 3. The increase in serum antiferment apparently favors the recovery of the animal.
