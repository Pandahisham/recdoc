Peripheral nerve blocks for paediatric day-stay surgery: one year's experience in a district general hospital.

Two hundred children underwent day-care surgery using peripheral nerve blockade as an adjunct to general anaesthesia during a twelve month period. Total post-operative analgesia was achieved in 86%, simple oral analgesia was needed in 9% and the remaining 5% of patients required systemic opiate administration for pain.
