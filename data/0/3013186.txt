LITHIUM AND KIDNEY: (A study of renal biopsy in Lithium patients)1

A study of renal biopsy in 13 lithium treated patients is reported. The light microscopic changes were non-specific and comprised glomerular hypercellularity; cloudy swelling of the tubular epithelium and interstitial fibrosis. Correlation between structural changes and functional alterations could not be established. The duration of therapy did not have any bearing on the intensity of the structural changes. No case of renal failure occurred in well controlled series as ours.
