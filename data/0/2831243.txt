Therapy of chronic wounds with water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA)

The central portion of chronic wounds is often hypoxic and relatively hypothermic, representing a deficient energy supply of the tissue, which impedes wound healing or even makes it impossible. Water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) is a special form of heat radiation with a high tissue penetration and a low thermal load to the skin surface. wIRA produces a therapeutically usable field of heat and increases temperature, oxygen partial pressure and perfusion of the tissue. These three factors are decisive for a sufficient tissue supply with energy and oxygen and consequently as well for wound healing, especially in chronic wounds, and infection defense. wIRA acts both by thermal and thermic as well as by non-thermal and non-thermic effects. wIRA can advance wound healing or improve an impaired wound healing process and can especially enable wound healing in non-healing chronic wounds. wIRA can considerably alleviate the pain and diminish wound exudation and inflammation and can show positive immunomodulatory effects.
In a prospective, randomized, controlled study of 40 patients with chronic venous stasis ulcers of the lower legs irradiation with wIRA and visible light (VIS) accelerated the wound healing process (on average 18 vs. 42 days until complete wound closure, residual ulcer area after 42 days 0.4 cm² vs. 2.8 cm²) and led to a reduction of the required dose of pain medication in comparison to the control group of patients treated with the same standard care (wound cleansing, wound dressing with antibacterial gauze, and compression garment therapy) without the concomitant irradiation. 
Another prospective study of 10 patients with non-healing chronic venous stasis ulcers of the lower legs included extensive thermographic investigation. Therapy with wIRA(+VIS) resulted in a complete or almost complete wound healing in 7 patients and a marked reduction of the ulcer size in another 2 of the 10 patients, a clear reduction of pain and required dose of pain medication, and a normalization of the thermographic image. 
In a current prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded study patients with non-healing chronic venous stasis ulcers of the lower legs are treated with compression garment therapy, wound cleansing, wound dressings and 30 minutes irradiation five times per week over 9 weeks. A preliminary analysis of the first 23 patients of this study has shown in the group with wIRA(+VIS) compared to a control group with VIS an advanced wound healing, an improved granulation and in the later phase of treatment a decrease of the bacterial burden. 
Some case reports have demonstrated that wIRA can also be used for mixed arterial-venous ulcers or arterial ulcers, if irradiation intensity is chosen appropriately low and if irradiation is monitored carefully. wIRA can be used concerning decubital ulcers both in a preventive and in a therapeutic indication. wIRA can improve the resorption of topically applied substances also on wounds. 
An irradiation with VIS and wIRA presumably acts with endogenous protoporphyrin IX (or protoporphyrin IX of bacteria) virtually similar as a mild photodynamic therapy (endogenous PDT-like effect). This could lead to improved cell regeneration and wound healing and to antibacterial effects. 
In conclusion, these results indicate that wIRA generally should be considered for the treatment of chronic wounds. 
Das Zentrum von chronischen Wunden ist oft hypoxisch und relativ hypotherm. Dies entspricht einer defizitären Energiebereitstellung im Gewebe, die die Wundheilung behindert oder unmöglich macht. Wassergefiltertes Infrarot A (wIRA) ist eine spezielle Form der Wärmestrahlung mit hohem Eindringvermögen in das Gewebe bei geringer thermischer Oberflächenbelastung. wIRA erzeugt ein therapeutisch nutzbares Wärmefeld und steigert Temperatur, Sauerstoffpartialdruck sowie die Durchblutung im Gewebe. Diese drei Faktoren sind entscheidend für eine ausreichende Versorgung des Gewebes mit Energie und Sauerstoff und deshalb auch für die Wundheilung, speziell bei chronischen Wunden, und die Infektionsabwehr. wIRA wirkt sowohl über thermische und temperaturabhängige als auch über nicht-thermische und temperaturunabhängige Effekte. wIRA kann die Wundheilung beschleunigen oder einen stagnierenden Wundheilungsprozess verbessern und insbesondere bei nicht-heilenden chronischen Wunden eine Wundheilung ermöglichen. wIRA vermag Schmerzen deutlich zu mindern und die Wundsekretion sowie Entzündung zu reduzieren sowie positive immunmodulierende Effekte zu zeigen. 
In einer prospektiven, randomisierten, kontrollierten Studie mit 40 Patienten mit chronischen venösen Unterschenkelulzera führte eine Bestrahlung mit wIRA und sichtbarem Licht (VIS) zu einer schnelleren Wundheilung (im Durchschnitt 18 vs. 42 Tage bis zum kompletten Wundschluss, Restulkusfläche nach 42 Tagen 0,4 cm² vs. 2,8 cm²) und einem geringeren Schmerzmittelverbrauch gegenüber einer in gleicher Form (Wundsäuberung, antibakterielle Wundauflagen und Kompressionstherapie) therapierten, aber nicht bestrahlten Kontrollgruppe. 
Eine weitere prospektive Studie mit 10 Patienten mit aufwändiger thermographischer Verlaufskontrolle ergab unter Therapie mit wIRA(+VIS) eine vollständige oder fast vollständige Abheilung therapierefraktärer chronischer Unterschenkelulzera bei 7 sowie eine deutliche Ulkusverkleinerung bei 2 weiteren der 10 Patienten, eine ausgeprägte Minderung der Schmerzen und des Schmerzmittelverbrauchs und eine Normalisierung des thermographischen Bildes. 
In einer laufenden prospektiven, randomisierten, kontrollierten, verblindeten Studie werden Patienten mit nicht-heilenden chronischen venösen Unterschenkelulzera mit Kompressionstherapie, Wundsäuberung und nicht-adhäsiven Wundauflagen sowie 30 Minuten Bestrahlung fünfmal pro Woche über 9 Wochen behandelt. Eine vorläufige Auswertung der ersten 23 Patienten zeigte, dass die Gruppe mit wIRA(+VIS) verglichen mit einer Kontrollgruppe mit VIS eine schnellere Wundheilung, eine bessere Granulation und in der späteren Phase der Behandlung eine Abnahme der bakteriellen Last der Wunden aufwies.
Einige Fallberichte haben gezeigt, dass wIRA selbst bei gemischt arteriell-venösen Ulzera oder arteriellen Ulzera eingesetzt werden kann, wenn die Bestrahlungsstärke angemessen niedrig gewählt und die Bestrahlung sorgfältig überwacht wird. wIRA kann bei Dekubitalulzera sowohl präventiv als auch therapeutisch eingesetzt werden. wIRA kann die Resorption topisch applizierter Substanzen auch auf Wunden verbessern.
Eine Bestrahlung mit VIS und wIRA wirkt vermutlich in Verbindung mit endogenem Protoporphyrin IX (oder Protoporphyrin IX von Bakterien) quasi ähnlich wie eine milde photodynamische Therapie (endogener PDT-ähnlicher Effekt). Dies kann die Zellregeneration und Wundheilung fördern und antibakteriell wirken.
Zusammengefasst zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass wIRA generell für die Behandlung chronischer Wunden erwogen werden sollte.

The central portion of chronic wounds is often markedly hypoxic and relatively hypothermic [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], representing a deficient energy supply of the tissue, which impedes wound healing, as wound healing and infection defense are processes with an extremely high energy demand [1], [2], [4], [5]. Tissue temperature [4], [5], [17], [18], tissue oxygen partial pressure [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], and tissue perfusion are decisive factors for a sufficient tissue supply with energy and oxygen and consequently as well for wound healing, especially in chronic wounds [1], [2]. Water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) as a special form of heat radiation with a high tissue penetration and with a low thermal load to the skin surface produces a therapeutically usable field of heat in the tissue and increases tissue temperature [4], [5], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], tissue oxygen partial pressure [4], [25], and tissue perfusion [22], [23], [24], [25], see review in [1], [2]. wIRA can advance wound healing or improve an impaired wound healing both in acute and in chronic wounds including infected wounds [1], [2].
wIRA in clinical use at appropriate irradiances has been described as helpful and safe [4], [5], [9], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], review in [1], [2], [3], and with possible protective cellular effects [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50].
Acute wounds and especially chronic wounds, non-healing wounds or infected problem wounds should be irradiated with wIRA at least three times per week and ideally once or twice per day for 20-30 minutes each [1], [2], [3]. Longer irradiation times are possible and often helpful. wIRA does not replace other sensible/necessary therapeutic procedures (such as compression garment therapy of chronic venous stasis ulcers of the lower legs [51], [52], [53]) but complements them [1], [2], [3]. Correspondingly the therapy with wIRA has to be embedded in an overall therapeutic concept [1], [2], [3]. wIRA can be used independently from therapy preferences concerning wound management (e.g. moist wound management) [1], [2], [3]. Typically during wIRA irradiation the wound has to be uncovered, as most bandages or wound dressings (with the exception of e.g. some tested transparent foils) are not adequately permeable for wIRA [1], [3]. 
Up to now 6 prospective clinical studies with wIRA concerning wound healing have been performed, 3 with acute wounds (presented in [3]) and 3 with chronic wounds (presented here), one of these is still in progress. Experiences with wIRA in wound healing especially of chronic wounds exist since approximately 1989 [54]. One of the authors has experiences in this field since 1991 [9]. Already from different results of these early publications the importance of moderate, limited irradiances could be deduced. Typical irradiances are 80-160 mW/cm² wIRA and visible light (VIS), corresponding to approximately 60-120 mW/cm² wIRA [1]. In the year 2000 the idea to treat as well acute wounds like surgical wounds with wIRA was introduced (first study with acute wounds [4], reviewed in [3]). 
40 patients with chronic venous stasis ulcers of the lower legs were treated in a prospective, randomized, controlled study in Basel, Switzerland, with standard care including wound cleansing, wound dressing with antibacterial gauze, and compression garment therapy. Additional application of three times a week 30 minutes irradiation with wIRA(+VIS) over a maximum of 6 weeks resulted in a significantly and relevantly accelerated wound healing process (on average 18 vs. 42 days until complete wound closure, residual ulcer area after 42 days 0.4 cm² vs. 2.8 cm²) as well as in a statistically significant (p<0.001) and relevant reduction of the required dose of pain medication in relation to the control group of patients treated with the same standard care without the concomitant irradiation [2], [28]. Figure 1 (Fig. 1) depicts a successful course of treatment.
Another prospective, primarily designed randomized, controlled study (University Tromsø/Norway and the Hospital in Hillerød/Denmark, performed in Hillerød/Denmark) of 10 patients with non-healing chronic venous stasis ulcers of the lower legs (one of the inclusion criteria: ulcer size up to 5 cm in diameter) including extensive thermographic investigations (see Figure 2 (Fig. 2)) resulted under therapy with wIRA(+VIS) (maximum total irradiance 185 mW/cm², approximately 140 mW/cm² (75%) wIRA and 45 mW/cm² (25%) VIS) in an accelerated wound healing process with complete or almost complete wound healing (96-100% reduction of wound area) in 7 of 10 patients and a reduction of the ulcer size in another 2 of 10 patients [2], [5]. 
An example of a successful course of therapy with wIRA(+VIS) irradiation is demonstrated in Figure 3 (Fig. 3) with normal view, thermographic image and temperature profile across the ulcer, in each case before therapy and after completion of therapy [2], [5]. 
Among the 6 patients without concomitant problems (peripheral occlusive arterial disease, smoking or lacking compression garment therapy) a complete or almost complete wound healing (96-100% reduction of wound area) was achieved without any exception. In contrast only in 1 of 5 ulcers of the 4 patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease, smoking or lacking compression garment therapy a complete or almost complete wound closure was accomplished [2], [5]. However, even in these 4 patients with 5 ulcers clear reductions of wound area were reached in 4 of the 5 ulcers. Only one patient, lacking compression garment therapy, had a slight increase of wound size, showing the importance of a compression garment therapy in the treatment of venous stasis ulcers. In one patient a randomized controlled side comparison was possible (therapy of one leg with an ulcer with wIRA(+VIS), therapy of the other leg with another ulcer with a control group radiator, emitting only VIS without wIRA) and revealed marked differences in favor of wIRA [2], [5]. 
In addition the study showed under therapy with wIRA(+VIS) a clear reduction of pain and required pain medication (e.g. from 15 to 0 pain tablets per day) and a normalization of the thermographic image. Prior to the start of therapy typically the ulcer border was hyperthermic, accompanied with a relative hypothermic ulcer base, partly associated with several degrees of temperature gradiance. At the end of the course of therapy the temperature differences were mostly balanced [2], [5]. All assessments using visual analog scales (VAS: pain sensation of the patient in the wound area, overall rating of the effect of the irradiation by the patient and by the clinical investigator, overall assessment of the feeling of the patient of the wound area, overall evaluation of the wound healing process by the clinical investigator, overall assessment of the cosmetic appearance by the patient and by the clinical investigator) improved remarkably during the period of irradiation therapy and commensurated with the improvement of the quality of life [2], [5]. 
Currently a prospective, randomized, controlled, blinded study with a planned cohort of approximately 50 patients with non-healing chronic venous stasis ulcers (one of the inclusion criteria: ulcer size 1-200 cm²) of the lower legs is performed at the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany, Department of Dermatology. A descriptive interim evaluation of the first 23 patients with compression garment therapy, wound cleansing and non-adhesive wound dressings (standardized regarding wound conditions) and 30 minutes irradiation five times per week over 9 weeks (and additional 4 weeks without irradiation) demonstrated an advanced wound healing and better granulation in the group with wIRA(+VIS) (maximum total irradiance 185 mW/cm², approximately 140 mW/cm² (75%) wIRA and 45 mW/cm² (25%) VIS) compared to a control group with VIS. 
Concerning wound bacteria the group with wIRA(+VIS) showed – compared to the control group with only VIS – after a temporary increase from the beginning of therapy until week 5 a decrease of the bacterial load in the wounds from week 7 over week 9 until the end of the study at week 13. Bacteriological differentiation revealed in the time period with decreasing bacterial level of the wounds both a decrease of physiologic flora of the skin, called contamination flora (coagulase negative staphylococci, micrococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., streptococcus spp.) and a decrease of pathogenic flora (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, hemolytic streptococci, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. coli). The early phase with an increase in the size of the bacterial inoculum (until week 3) is mainly due to nonpathogenic contaminants. In summary, after a phase with increased bacterial growth for the first 3 weeks (mainly with nonpathogenic bacteria), the group with wIRA(+VIS) showed a decrease of bacterial growth. The better healing of the wounds might explain the impeded growth of bacteria, which vice versa results in an accelerated healing of these lesions even in the presence of significant and severe comorbidities and challenges.
88 year old woman with an infected (lightly malodorous) crustaceous ulcer (of the right distal medial lower leg), which had existed for 13 months and had increased despite of conservative dermatological therapy including local antisepsis, systemic antibiotic, and non-adhesive wound dressing up to 10 cm in diameter. Chronic venous insufficiency with marked stasis related edemas of the lower legs and extensive stasis dermatitis, diabetes mellitus type II (orally treated), slight overweight, and decreased amount of daily motion. Under irradiation with wIRA(+VIS) 30 minutes once daily, compression garment therapy, local antisepsis, non-adhesive wound dressing and possibility to end the systemic antibiotic therapy a complete wound closure was reached within approximately five months. The course of the treatment is depicted in Figure 4 (Fig. 4) [2].
77 year old woman with a pruriginous, erosive stasis dermatitis for 8 years. Contact allergy to scent-mixture. Intermittent topical therapies with hydrocortisone and tacrolimus. In November 2005 development of an ulcer of the lower leg. Local treatments with povidon iodine, ammoniumbituminosulfonat and compression garment therapy of the lower leg resulted in a reduction of ulcer size, but no healing of the ulcer was achieved. In September 2006 irradiations with wIRA(+VIS) for 30 minutes each were started, see initial situation of Figure 5 (Fig. 5). The first 7 irradiations were performed within the first 3 weeks and additional 6 irradiations within the next 5 weeks. After 13 irradiations the ulcer and the stasis dermatitis in the treated area were healed, see course of the treatment in Figure 5 (Fig. 5). Up to now (approximately 1 year follow-up) the patient is free of complaints.
Approximately 80% of ulcers of the lower legs are venous stasis ulcers (or ulcers at least dominated by venous problems) and systematic studies about the use of wIRA concerning ulcers of the lower legs have been performed up to now in venous stasis ulcers (or ulcers at least dominated by venous problems). From a theoretical point of view undesired effects like an arterial steal effect might be considered when thinking about the use of wIRA for mixed arterial-venous ulcers or even for arterial ulcers. The following examples show that wIRA can be used even in these indications, if irradiance is chosen appropriately low and if irradiation is monitored carefully. 
Example 1: the size of an already for years existing mixed arterial-venous ulcer of the lower leg of a smoker in a nursing home decreased within 16 days with 14 wIRA(+VIS) treatments of 15 minutes from 4.2 x 2.5 cm to 1.5 x 0.5 cm, the overall evaluation of the wound healing process (visual analog scale VAS 0-100) by the nurse improved within these 16 days from 6 to 75, the pain in the wound area (VAS 0-100) decreased from 48 to 33, the assessment of the feeling of the patient of the irradiation (VAS -50/+50, 0 as indifferent point) improved from +4 to +16, and the overall rating of the effect of the irradiation (VAS -50/+50, 0 as indifferent point) by the nurse improved from 0 to +26 [2]. 
Example 2: chronic venous insufficiency (third degree to Widmer) combined with peripheral occlusive arterial disease (second degree to Fontaine) and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (type II). Already within approximately 10 days with wIRA(+VIS) therapy a clear trend to heal with nearly complete healing of three smaller ulcers of the lower leg was achieved [2], [25].
Example 3: chronic venous insufficiency combined with peripheral occlusive arterial disease and diabetes mellitus with microangiopathy; approximately 7 cm large ulcer of the lower leg in the area of the tibia (with small second ulcer): under wIRA(+VIS) therapy within 15 days clear reduction of scabs, begin of granulation, nearly complete reduction of inflammatory readness of the surrounding skin [2]. A marked increase of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin between before and after a single wIRA treatment, especially in the depth of tissue, could be measured with an external probe [2], [25].
Under special precautions (monitoring of oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin, of relative hemoglobin quantity in the tissue, of blood flow velocity and blood flow with an external measuring probe acral to the arterial ulcer of the lower leg during irradiation and on the ulcer base following the irradiation) an arterial ulcer of the lower leg was irradiated with a low irradiance with wIRA(+VIS): despite of the peripheral occlusive arterial disease there was a good subjective tolerance, no steal effect occurred and the measurement on the ulcer base after the end of the irradiation with wIRA(+VIS) showed a marked increase of the superficial and deep blood flow [2], [25].
wIRA can be used both in a preventive and a therapeutic indication concerning decubital ulcers e.g. in nursing homes. A decubitus existing for 6 weeks without tendency to recover on the buttocks clearly improved (less furred, visible granulation) under therapy with wIRA(+VIS) irradiation 30 minutes twice daily over 5 weeks and the diameter decreased from 6 to approximately 3.5 cm [2]. 
wIRA causes – as shown in several investigations with different methods [33], [34], [35] – an amplified effect of topically applied substances, e.g. increased effect of a topically applied local anaesthetic (tetracain) with a more rapid, more intensive and longer effect [33] or of topical corticosteroids [34]. Thus, wIRA can be used as an alternative to an occlusive dressing.
As an additional effect in wounds, wIRA can be used to increase the penetration of a wound cream, as used for a part of the treatment period in the female patient depicted in Figure 4 (Fig. 4).
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses photosensitizing agents. These agents are taken up by the target tissue, preferentially by hyperproliferative tissue or by tissue with neoangiogenesis [55]. The photosensitizer is a chemical compound that can be excited by light of a specific wavelength. The PDT involves typically the photosensitizer, (light-) radiation, oxygen, and cell substances (e.g. lipids). This leads by different mechanisms including oxygen radicals, hydroxyl radicals, superoxide anions, and singlet oxygen to the desired cytotoxic or cell metabolism modulating effect [26], [56], [57], [58].
An irradiation of skin or wounds with VIS+wIRA without a topically administered photosensitizer presumably acts with endogenous protoporphyrin IX (and/or protoporphyrin IX of bacteria) virtually similar as a mild PDT (endogenous PDT-like effect) [2], [59], being able to modulate the immune system and/or to induce necrosis/apoptosis of damaged cells and of bacteria [59]. This can improve cell regeneration and thus wound healing [2], [60]. From clinical experience under irradiation with VIS+wIRA superficial wound infections are often overcome without antibiotic or antiseptic usage within days. For excitation of protoporphyrin IX it is possible to use within the visible light only one absorption band at approximately 629 nm (see orange curve in Figure 6 (Fig. 6) [26]) or all 5 absorption bands [55] (see blue curve in Figure 6 (Fig. 6)) or any other single absorption band or combination of absorption bands. The choice of the absorption bands has influence on the gradient of the effective integral irradiance of absorption bands from the surface into the depth [26]. wIRA might amplify the PDT effect. The above mentioned point of view of an endogenous PDT-like effect [2], [59] is supported by current publications which describe the photoinactivation of bacteria by visible light and endogenously formed and accumulated porphyrins without an administered substance (most effective blue violet light, 405 nm, corresponding to an absorption band of protoporphyrin IX [61], [62], or 420 nm, phototoxic effect on the porphyrin metabolism of Propionibacterium acnes [63]). 
Endogenous PDT-like effects might be a part of the explanation of the clinically positive effects of VIS+wIRA on wounds with regard to both healing and infection. It seems plausible that a topically applied photosensitizer could increase the PDT effect. The prodrugs delta aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and the methyl derivative methyl-amino-oxo-pentanoat (MAOP) are frequently used for PDT in dermatology. They are metabolized endogenously into the photosensitizing substance protoporphyrin IX. For example, a massive reduction of the bacterial colonisation of burns in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus by means of PDT with a photosensitizing porphyrin and visible (red) light has been published [64].
Positive effects of wIRA on chronic wounds have been demonstrated in three studies and already in routine clinical use: especially improved wound healing and enabling of the healing process in non-healing wounds combined with antiinfective effects and decreased pain, inflammation, and hypersecretion. Concerning patients with chronic wounds wIRA is a highly valuable therapeutic option and should be generally taken into account. Prevention of decubital ulcers by wIRA in long-term care facilities or home care is an additional valuable indication. The above described combination with photodynamic therapy might additionally improve the treatment of infected wounds.
