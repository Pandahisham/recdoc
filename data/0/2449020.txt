Alcohol-related attendances at an accident and emergency department.

Using a self-administered alcohol-related questionnaire and the clinical records a survey was made of the prevalence and severity of alcohol-related problems in the accident and emergency department at the Belfast City Hospital. Of 10,410 consecutive attendances during three months, 6,625 completed a questionnaire: 4,349 admitted they took alcohol at some time, 906 men exceeded 21 units weekly, and 490 women exceeded 14 units weekly. The majority of those who drank were under the age of 35 years. Only 182 considered that they might have an alcohol-related problem. Possible health promotion initiatives for these at-risk patients are considered which might be used specifically in an accident and emergency department.
