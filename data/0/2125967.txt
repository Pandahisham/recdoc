EXPERIMENTAL ACUTE NEPHRITIS 

 1. In experimental nephritis caused by cantharidin, arsenic, diphtheria toxin, and potassium chromate, in addition to the retention of the non-protein and urea nitrogen and of the chlorides in blood, an acidosis occurs. 2. Sodium bicarbonate given by the stomach has the power of diminishing the acidosis in these types of nephritis. 3. The degree of increase in the non-protein and urea nitrogen content in the blood in mild nephritis varies considerably in different dogs receiving the same dose per kilo of a given poison. 4. Histological examination shows little if any influence resulting from the administration of sodium bicarbonate upon the grade of the nephritis induced by the poisons.
