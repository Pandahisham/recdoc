Ultrasound Diagnosis of Acute Neck Pain and Swelling

A 33-year-old man presented to the emergency department with two days of right-sided facial and submandibular swelling. He denied fevers, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing or recent dental problems. The patientâ€™s medical history was unremarkable and he had no similar prior symptoms. Physical exam was notable for a tender, firm, right-sided neck mass below the angle of the mandible and a tongue-like, soft-tissue protrusion of the right sublingual region (Figure 1). A bedside ultrasound was performed revealing two sialoliths and ductal dilatation (Figure 2). Otolaryngology was consulted and the stones were subsequently removed two days later via a transoral approach.
Sialolithiasis occurs most commonly in the submandibular gland (80%), followed by the parotid (15%), and the sublingual (<5%).1 The submandibular gland is more prone to calculi because: 1) the duct is longer and larger in diameter with slower saliva flow rates, 2) saliva flows against gravity, and 3) saliva is more alkaline, with a higher mucin and calcium content.
Ultrasound is 90% accurate in diagnosing sialolithiasis and was instrumental in the management of this patient.2 The initial plan was to administer IV antibiotics and obtain computed tomography (CT), to rule out a possible abscess. Ultrasound clinched the diagnosis in a rapid, accurate manner and permitted the avoidance of a CT scan and the associated radiation, cost and time delays.
The treatment of sialoliths generally involves conservative management. Patients with symptoms persisting for more than a few days should be referred to Otolaryngology. Sialoendoscopy, fluoroscopy-guided wire basket extraction, lithotripsy, and open surgical removal are options when expectant management fails or is inappropriate. Typically stones less than 2 mm in diameter can be treated without surgical intervention.3
