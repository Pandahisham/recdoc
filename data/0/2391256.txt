 A system has been designed which is based on an adaptive, flexible, glove-like membrane that forms a smaller volume and hermetic enclosure around the inspected item (checked or carryon luggage), with minimal stray air around it. This minimizes the air quantity that needs to be treated, manipulated, and examined, while increasing the “signal-to-noise” ratio. Clean air is introduced in the enclosure by pulsed jet nozzles while the air is collected by special suction nozzles. The blowing and suction nozzles are mounted on the membrane, with maximum efficiency due to proximity to the inspected surface. Several compression/decompression cycles allow extraction of air carrying traces of explosives from inside the inspected item. The air is then passed through an electrostatic trap to collect these particles and pass them finally to a trace analyzer, such as an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS). The automated trace collection is effected without manual intervention, using a device that collects the particles using pneumatic methods and mechanical agitation.
Detection time is below 30 seconds/per baggage. The system allows for remote standoff operation, decreasing the risk of blast to personnel, whilst the false positive alarm rate is not more than the false alarm rate of the sensor system. This is based on testing conducted at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport, where over 1000 pieces of hand luggage were tested using a Smith's Detection Ionscan 400 ETD.
Effective and safe hand-held mine detection is dependent on optimizing the man-machine interface. For this to happen the operator must be optimally trained while the detector must be designed to be easy to use. That means it must be simple to operate in a manner that the human is capable of doing within a practical amount of training, and the information provided by the detector must be reliably accurate and easy for the operator to understand. For humanitarian deminers, training and many hours of use may eventually enable fitting the human to the machine, assuming a mistake is not first made. But for soldiers, who have many other tasks in which they must also continuously maintain skills, the design of both the detector and the training task must be as simple as can be safe and effective.
The Army Research Laboratory in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Missouri-Rolla, and Lincoln University has conducted various research studies pertaining to hand-held mine detection. The results of these studies are providing guidance for improved detector design, improved training techniques, and better training tools and facilities. The objectives of these studies have been to optimize soldier performance with the detector.
These studies have focused on methods for rejecting clutter, influence of distracters on probability of detection, learning decay over one- to three-month intervals, effectiveness of computer-based instruction, and potential for supplementing detection with visual techniques.
This presentation will summarize the findings from these studies and present recommendations for improving Soldier's hand-held mine detection performance.
A microfluidic-based circulatory vessel comprised of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (bPAECs) within poly(dimethylsiloxane) PDMS-based channels is described. Here, the optimal concentration, incubation temperature, and period of incubation time for fibronectin and bPAECs, two components of the immobilization, are described. To optimize the number of viable cells adhered to the channels, varying concentrations of fibronectin ranging from 1 μg/mL to 500 μg/mL were incubated in a PDMS-coated 24-well sterile plate, aspirated off, and a cell suspension(>50,000 cells/mL) was added to each well. The incubation time (0 to 90 minutes) and temperature (25°C to 37°C) were also examined in a similar manner. For bPAECs, the optimal period of cell incubation on fibronectin-coated PDMS and the appropriate density of cell suspension for confluency were established. Results suggest that fibronectin concentration, as well as incubation temperature, impacts the number and viability of cells that adhere to the PDMS surface. Fibronectin concentration was determined to be optimal at 50 μg/mL and a 10% increase in the number of viable cells was observed when the incubation temperature was raised to 37°C. A correlation exists between the number of viable cells on the PDMS and an increase in the incubation time of the cells, as well as an increase in bPAEC density. The optimal bPAEC incubation time was determined to be 120 minutes with the bPAEC solution having the highest density (150,000 cells/mL) becoming confluent in the well plate within a few hours, while dilutions of the solution were still not confluent after an overnight incubation. The incubation time of fibronectin has little effect on the average number of cells that grow on the plate after 15 minutes. These results were then applied to create a more reproducible biomimetic system using microfluidic technology for studying multiple cell lines in a microchannel.
Microfluidic devices are valuable tools for studying cells and are potentially compatible with long-term cellular measurements. It is possible to integrate and automate several functions on one chip, including sample collection from cells, injection of the sample, and detection of analytes. Furthermore, it is simple to manipulate the cellular environment in a microfluidic space, allowing for good temporal resolution for monitoring. Previously, we developed a device that can maintain living cells in culture and monitor their secretion at 6-second intervals by an electrophoresis-based immunoassay. The device has been applied to monitoring insulin secretion from single islets of Langerhans over periods of 2 hours. In the present work, we describe developments that allow this device to be used for monitoring over periods of 1–5 days. Previously, long-term continuous monitoring on the chip was limited by degradation of reagents and electrophoresis buffers. To resolve this problem, in the modified chip, all reagents were continuously perfused into the device with a gas pressure system, so only fresh reagents were used for analysis. The introduction of particulates, which clog the microfluidic channels, prevented long-term immunoassay stability. The source of the particulates was determined to be a component of the gas pressure system and was then replaced. Failure of the electrical relay, which controlled the sample injection, also hindered the immunoassay stability; this problem was solved by using a relay rated for longer operation (1 × 109 cycles). With these modifications, the immunoassay had a 4% RSD over 24 hours of continuous operation and a detection limit of 0.9 nM. The long-term monitoring chip will now be used for novel experiments that require measurements of slowly developing phenomena of islets such as temporal changes that result from time in culture and effects of lipids.
Field sampling is often influenced by many environmental variables such as temperature, turbidity, and water flow. When using SPME for field sampling, many of these variables can be eliminated or minimized. SPME extraction is dependent upon extraction conditions such as temperature and agitation. Temperature is not possible to be controlled in the field but we can control the agitation of the fiber in the water sample. Once the agitation is controlled, the concentration of analytes can be quantitated because the thickness of the boundarylayer,  a zone of defined width between the fiber and the bulk of the fluid where no convection occurs, can be estimated based on empirical formulae. Portable hand-held stirring devices have been developed using cordless drills. A special “drill bit”  was created to hold an SPME fiber or a piece of PDMS thin film which are the two extraction techniques used in our experiments. Comparisons between the agitated fiber, the agitated thin film, the static fiber, and the static thin film were completed and showed that the agitated thin film has the fastest extraction time and the largest capacity. This is due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the thin film compared to the SPME fiber. We are able to achieve rapid, reproducible extraction on site using the hand-held stirring device with very little cost.
Isocyanates are important compounds in the field of occupational hygiene. They show severe acute toxicity and have also strong sensitizing properties. Sensitization usually takes at least several weeks of exposure, but then even very low concentrations below current occupational exposure limits (OELs) could trigger life-threatening asthma attacks.
As for the determination of isocyanate concentrations in air, all routine and standard measurements are based on active sampling methods. In recent years, passive sampling methods have proven great effectiveness and reliability for air monitoring applications for many airborne analytes. Regarding isocyanates, there are up to now only two fully validated passive methods for methyl isocyanate (MIC) known from the literature [1, 2], as well as an early approach [3]  reporting a passive dosimeter for toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Furthermore, a method for diffusion-controlled sampling of TDI and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) using SPME devices has been reported.
In this paper, we present a fully validated diffusive sampling method for the determination of airborne methyl (MIC), ethyl (EIC), and phenyl (PhIC) isocyanates using 4-nitro-7-piperazinobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBDPZ)-coated [4] SDB filter tapes as collection material. Validation was carried out by active sampling using 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine (2-MP) as derivatizing agent. Sampling intervals were between 15 minutes and more than 8 hours. Sampling rates ranged from 21.0 mL/min for MIC down to 11.5 mL/min for PhIC. The limits of quantification were 1.4 ppb for MIC and 1.3 ppb for EIC and PhIC applying 15-minutes sampling periods.
In 2004, EPA warned against widespread pollution of lakesand rivers by mercury, dioxin, PCBs, pesticide pollution and othercontaminants. The EPA administrator confirmed that nearly everytime officials check for pollution, they find it. The NaturalResources Defense Council reported in 2005 that unknown andillicit sewage sources continue to degrade natural habitats andthereby increasing the risk of infectious bacteriological diseasesin drinking and recreational waters resulting in 19 950 beachclosing/advisory days in 2004—a tenfold increase since 1994.
 Keeping the nation's water supply clean and safe is ofincreasing concern, and is compounded by the inability to traceillicit contamination sources. EPA is identifying endocrinedisruptors from 87 000 chemicals. Emerging contaminants enterwaterways through the 90 000 municipal, industrial, pharmaceutical,and agricultural wastewater systems. 
 Over the next decade, it has been suggested that potable waterresources, on a worldwide basis, will be a more important issuethan the current concerns about fossil fuels. Taking into accountall of the above comments, it is becoming increasingly importantto have easily deployable instrumentation and sensing systems forthe monitoring of all aspects of water quality. 
 MicroSpectral Sensors has developed a new miniature,multiparameter spectral measurement system as a low-cost solutionfor field-based and online monitoring of environmentalcontamination threats. These are intended to provide real-timemeasurements of a wide variety of contaminants. This paper willreview the applications of this new technology to currentwater-quality measurement methods. 
A laboratory uses a range of informatics components including LIMS, CDS, ELN, and ECM/SDMS. The role of each of these components overlaps and it is not always clear which solution is the best. For example, which system do you use to store chromatography results?
Even though these better-known systems handle a lot of thelaboratories' requirements, there are still key areas that untilrecently have no clear solution. Managing manual procedures andautomating small instruments are two key areas. 
Other than specific instrument data systems, the commoninformatics products available today are not designed forreal-time management. They play a role in planning the work forthe laboratory and in storing results, but they do not getinvolved in the actual analysis process. Consequently, theirability to manage workflow and control analysis is limited ornonexistent. Real-time management of the laboratory requires acompletely new approach.
 This presentation will examine the role of each of the commoninformatics components discussing both their strengths andweaknesses. It will then highlight key areas that are stilllacking automation solutions. Finally, it will present a newconcept in informatics that integrates the strengths of existingcomponents with new real-time management control capabilities.This new concept redefines the role of informatics in thelaboratory.
 Most electronic laboratory notebooks have beendesigned to assist in R&D operations. Many of the keyconsiderations for these ELNs are based on conceptsinvolving collaboration, documentation, and protection ofintellectual property. This type of design however does not lenditself well to the requirements of automating routine procedures.For routine analyses, there is a need to control the informationthat is recorded in order to ensure that it fulfills requirementsand follows standards. Unlike the R&D environment, it isnot acceptable or desirable to record any observation or any datathat the analyst feels is appropriate. Instead, the requirement isfor a much more controlled set of data. 
In this session, we will highlight key considerations when investigating an ELN for routine procedures and discuss the benefits that can be realized by utilizing this technology as part of a laboratory informatics strategy.
One of the key problems laboratories are trying to solve is how  I make my results available to the people who need them. How can I help them to make decisions? Laboratories can have hundreds of different instrument and equipment types from different vendors all with different software packages. This talk will discuss how use of web services and XML can simplify this process for the laboratory and ensure quick decisions for the business.
What is special about fast track LIMS? Rigid adherence to principles of “fast” and “On track” phased implementation focused on achievable, priority deliverables, rapid decision making, constant monitoring and communication of progress against deliverables and resolution of issues, and so forth.
Laboratory information management systems (LIMS's) are highly complex systems that support multiple users and business processes that cross organization boundaries. LIMS interfaces with a myriad of instruments systems for data collection and helps achieve business goals through integration with other business systems. Implementation of LIMS is difficult. The road is littered with LIMS projects that did not quite meet their intended goals. Projects are frequently late, run over budget, or stop short of producing the results that were used to justify the original project.
Fast track LIMS is a proven methodology that gets LIMS implementation done quickly and keeps it “on track.” “On track” means that the implementation focuses on the correct end goals, is accomplished with efficient use of both time and resources, and produces an enduring solution that meets business needs.
This presentation will describe the principles and activities involved in the fast track methodology. The paper will address the full LIMS life cycle starting with requirements, vendor selection, design and build, configuration, and data loading through going live. The speakers will discuss some of the typical pitfalls awaiting a LIMS implementation and describe keys to success or proven ways of addressing these pitfalls. A case study will be presented highlighting the critical decisions that enabled fast track implementation and reviewing barriers to optimal execution.
Pharmaceutical R&D and manufacturing have not changed their fundamental paper-based infrastructure in decades. The principal reason is that science by nature and regulatory requirements resist change. Recently, industry and FDA have been more aligned with respect to utilizing innovation and technology to bring manufacturing processes into the 21st century. Leading companies are adopting a new approach to “automating R&D and compliance,” that is, utilizing innovative technologies (such as ELN strategies) and building quality into the research, quality, and compliance infrastructures.
The talk will discuss the current situation in cGMP lab operations relative to FDA initiatives in manufacturing and the broad opportunity for electronic lab notebook processes. The paper will profile an innovative “method-centric” software platform, designed to electronically execute and manage laboratory protocols, yielding significant reductions in overall method execution cycle times, and electronically capture all data and metadata in a common repository. Several large pharmaceutical IT infrastructure design examples will be outlined.
One of the most onerous tasks for a regulated lab is simply taking advantage of their investment. The cost and effort of validating and implementing laboratory software have forced laboratories to upgrade only every three to five years to ensure a positive return on investment. By using new software technology, vendors can deliver software that is easier to implement and validate and provides a real benefit to the end users.
Organometallic species of mercury, lead and tin, and redoxstates of chromium play important roles in biological as well asenvironmental processes because they are highly toxic and canbe of anthropogenic and/or biogenic origin. A simple and efficientcoextraction method was developed for simultaneous extraction ofdifferent species of mercury, lead, organotins, and chromium frombiological samples by using closed-vessel microwave-assistedextraction protocol. The developed extraction method was validatedusing certified reference materials of biological origin andapplied to biological samples. The developed extraction method wasvalidated by implementing EPA method 6800 as a diagnostic tool forspecies transformation during extraction and/or analysis usingICP-MS coupled with both liquid and gas chromatography. Thiscoextraction method for multispecies analysis incorporates manybenefits of microwave extraction and method 6800 in terms ofspeed, low solvent use, accuracy of measurement, sensitivity,relative simplicity, as well as the time saving and convenience ofmultiple species measurement through sample preparation andanalysis as an integrated step. 
 UPLC allows chromatographers to get higher-resolution, faster chromatographic methods by improving systemefficiency. In addition to improved efficiency, chemical factorscan be manipulated to improve the selectivity and retentivity of aseparation. In this lecture, we explore and measure how factorssuch as pH, organic modifier, temperature, and column chemistryaffect separations in UPLC by combining improved efficiency withmanipulations of selectivity and retentivity to develop high-resolution chromatographic methods.
The automation of this approach is implemented with a new, low-dispersion, 4-position column selection device which has been introduced to effectively and efficiently screen multiple variables.
In this lecture, we discuss the chromatographic effect of chemical factors on retentivity and selectivity. By understanding these effects, we can formulate a systematic screening protocol that streamlines the methods development process.
UPLC has gained popularity since its introduction in 2004. UPLC provides faster analysis time and higher efficiency compared to regular HPLC. However, a method that is truly optimized for UPLC cannot be run directly on a traditional HPLC system, mainly due to pressure limitations. It can be a dilemma for analysts or lab managers when deciding which technique will be used for a routine analytical method since they are considered two different methods and there is no easy way to transfer (or translate) methods between UPLC and HPLC to ensure, most importantly, equivalent selectivity.
 A systematic approach to covert UPLC conditions to traditionalHPLC conditions will be discussed. In this approach,DryLab software was used to facilitatetranslation of UPLC conditions to traditional HPLC conditions. Acombination of four temperature and gradient scout runs wasperformed under UPLC conditions. The retention times and peakareas of each component for each experimental run were enteredinto the DryLab software to establish aretention model for UPLC conditions. This DryLab retention modelfor UPLC was verified by actual verification runs to compare tothose predicated by DryLab. Next, the columnparameters dwell volume and flow rate were changed from UPLCparameters to traditional HPLC conditions within theDryLab software to predict separationperformance.
 In summary, our experiments showed that (1) DryLab can be usedto accurately optimize UPLC separations and (2) canaccurately translate UPLC conditions to traditional HPLCconditions and predict retention behavior very well (provided thatthe selectivity of UPLC and HPLC columns is the same). 
 In crisis and consequence management against biological andchemical terrorism, monitoring, detection, and identification areimportant for prevention of terrorism occurrence and minimizationof damage. Among terroristic weapons, chemical warfare agents(CWAs) and biological toxins (toxins) show toxic effectwithin one day, and so on-site detection is desirable. We haveevaluated commercially available on-site detection equipment forCWAs and toxins, and elucidated shortcomings of thepresent on-site detection system conducted by first responders:low sensitivity against gaseous CWAs and toxins, highfalse positive frequency, and tedious operation. To overcome thedifficulty in reliable on-site detection activity, we havedeveloped three new technologies: monitoring tape method (MTM),counterflow introduction atmospheric pressure chemical ionizationmass spectrometry (CFI-APCI-MS), and sugar-based chip biosensormethod (biosensor). MTM enables sensitive (LOD: sub mg/m3) andaccurate detection of blood and choking agents within1 minute, using portable multiarray diffusion-typeapparatus. CFI-APCI-MS enables very sensitive (LOD: subμg/m3) and continuous monitoring of volatile (nerve gas andblister agent) and nonvolatile (vomit agent and tear gas)CWAs, using ion-trap type analyzer. Biosensor enablessensitive (sub n/mL level) detection of ricin and botulinumtoxins, using specific carbohydrate ligands and surface plasmonresonance measurement. By combining these newly developedtechnologies and commercially available equipment such as ionmobility spectrometer, it is possible to detect thoroughCWAs and toxins sensitively, rapidly, and accuratelywithout tedious operation.
The concept of a “spectrometer on a chip” has been discussed now for many years. Although certain specialized measurement systems have been developed featuring customized electronics, there has not been any form of general-purpose instrumentation based on a chip-based optical spectrometer.
 A miniaturized spectral sensing system has been developedbased on an optical chip assembly measuring approximately8 mm × 1 mm. The sensor, based on a128-element optical array, is capable of providing spectral datafrom the UV to the near infrared. The device has been integratedinto a spectral measurement engine that includes solid state lightsources, on-board signal acquisition, data conditioning, andspectral data extraction. The entire package has been designed tobe accommodated on a single board system with accompanyingelectronics for information display and communications. Thiscompact system does feature conventional optics and is designed tobe constructed from inexpensive molded parts. The result is anoptimized, versatile sensing system that can be easily integratedinto different measurement platforms.
 This paper will discuss the spectral sensing concept and itsapplication to spectral absorption and fluorescence-basedmeasurements. In its current manifestations, the spectral engine isapplied to hand-held and online systems that feature integratedsample handling. The on-board intelligence provides the storage ofa large number of methods that can be applied to a host ofindustrial, environmental, and biological applications. Examplespresented will include both water-based and organic chemistries.
 It has been demonstrated that near infraredspectroscopy (NIRS) is an ideal technology for moisturedetermination in fluid bed dryers for the pharmaceutical industry.There are numerous publications to support this. However, theactual implementation in a production environment, to the best ofour knowledge, has not been demonstrated. This paper describes indetail the several stages required for a successful installation,from feasibility testing in a laboratory environment through to the validation of the entire process.
Over the years, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been coupled with multivariate techniques to determine concentration of active ingredients and excipients in pharmaceutical drug products. Typically, quantitative aspect of chemometrics analysis involves the generation of multivariate calibration models from a set of data collected on a particular NIR instrument.
When implementing chemometrics-based algorithms for online spectroscopic systems, it is critical that the dataset of the calibration model be representative exhibiting the full range of variations expected for the eventual unknown sample. The variations could be any spectroscopically sensitive parameters, such as instrumental differences, instrumental drift, and chemical or physical properties of drug substance and excipients. However, due to the difficulty, if not impossibility, in incorporating foreseeable variations into the original calibration model, solely relying on simple chemometrics-based algorithms is risky. It is essential for the pharmaceutical industry to adopt the development of specialized calibration transfer (SCT) algorithms as well as using these algorithms to evaluate any spectral variances in the data.
In this research, various techniques will be evaluated on their efficiency and effectiveness in handling the problems encountered during calibration transfer. The data analysis will be based on datasets collected on multiple NIR instruments over a period of weeks. Spectral variances will be investigated mainly based on measurement of solid dosage from samples.
 A pharmaceutical tablet usually carries severaldesired properties to facilitate the delivery of the activepharmaceutical ingredient (API). Since many tablet properties areoften affected by several parameters in raw materials and processes,pharmaceutical companies have started using multivariate analysisincreasingly to achieve desired properties in the development of atablet formulation. To accommodate the most variability andflexibility in a formulation, it is often needed to maximize theranges of several parameters that affect a tablet property. Theaim of this work is to find out an accurate and effective way ofmaximizing several parameter ranges simultaneously for a tabletproperty development. 
In this work, an accurate multivariate model was first established to correlate a tablet property with all the parameters that could affect the property. Three methods were then used to maximize the ranges of all the effective parameters so that the desired tablet property could always be achieved within the calculated ranges. The first method used Monte Carlo simulation to obtain a large amount of synthetic data for the extraction of parameter ranges. The second method used a function optimization algorithm with the multivariate model as the objective function to obtain the parameter ranges. The last method used response surface methodology with polynomial models to obtain the parameter ranges. The results of these three methods were compared for accuracy and ease of use.
 Many USEPA methods require that all drinking waterand waste water samples be preserved with acid during thecollection process to pH less than 2 prior to analysis forvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) by purge and trap (P&T).Water sample preservation prevents degradation prior to analysis,and each analytical method describes a unique preservationtechnique. Some of the methods requiring acid preservation priorto analysis are USEPA methods 502, 524, 624, 5030, and 8260. Otherregulatory VOC methods, such as the Massachusetts volatilepetroleum hydrocarbon (VPH) method, offer the option of preservingthe sample by raising the pH of the sample above 11.
 For nearly thirty years, the process of measuring, recording,and reporting each sample's pH level has been an entirelymanual procedure. The technician or chemist must open each samplevial, measure the pH manually using either pH indicator strips ora pH probe, record the measurement in a logbook, and then includethe measurements in the final client report. For high-throughputlaboratories with multiple P&T instruments analyzingsamples 24 hours each day, this practice can be extremelytime-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive.
 This poster describes a new instrument that fully automatesthe entire process of measuring, recording, and reporting the pHlevel for all VOC water samples to verify that the pH level meetsthe requirements specified in regulatory methods. The newinstrument improves laboratory productivity and profitability byeliminating the labor and materials required for manualmeasurement of pH levels of VOC water samples. 
 Epoxies were first introduced commercially in theearly 1950's for the aerospace industry and are now widelyused for a variety of applications, including manufacturing ofcommercial vehicles, electronics, inks, and varnishes. Epoxiesconsist of two components: a resin and a curing agent or hardener,which are tailored for specific properties such as adhesion,elasticity, and hardness. For the best performance, the two componentsare mixed and cured under controlled conditions. 
 It is important to have real-time methods of analyzing theepoxy curing process to determine the optimum curing conditionsfor a given epoxy, for quality-control purposes, and to betterunderstand the kinetics and underlying chemical processes.Spectroscopic methods for examining epoxies curing in real timeare not common since many epoxies are not readily removed fromthe windows or crystals used for transmission or ATR measurements.
 The introduction of the diamond ATR crystal now makesreal-time monitoring of epoxies curing  feasible. Diamond isextremely hard so the bonded epoxy can simply be scrapped off.This paper examines the curing of an epoxy under controlledelevated temperatures in real time using a new heated diamond ATR.
 With widespread availability of electronic balances,a novel simple approach to gravimetric titrations becomes anattractive alternative to usual syringe-based automatic titrators.The tested setup consists of electronic balances with RS-232 orUSB connection to the PC, a vessel for titrant solution, deliverysystem, and an appropriate detector that is also connected to thesame PC via suitable data logging device. A number of detectorsfor various types of titration were tested: a pH electrode, a pAgelectrode, Pt electrode for redox titrations, and a fiber opticsprobe connected to the CCD-based spectrophotometer. Simultaneouscollection of the mass of titrant vessels and correspondingdetector readings produces satisfactory titration curves suitablefor automatic titration with three-digit precision. 
Several variants of delivery system are discussed. Modifications of the usual titration procedures are described.
The suggested experimental setup presents a low-cost option for automatic titration in a college laboratory.
 Determination of organic contaminants is regulated bygovernments all over the world and has been included as prioritypollutants in the European Union lists. Pesticides constitute avery important group of these compounds owing to their hightoxicity and their extended use in agricultural practice.
The standard method for the analysis of pesticides in vegetablesamples is chromatography with selective detectors and eventuallyGC-MS. Due to the complex matrices,  complicated sample cleaningprocedures are needed, previously to the HRGC analysis. Classicalmethods consist in a pesticide extraction with ethyl acetate fromthe vegetable; then the supernatant is evaporated to dryness andfinally dissolved to obtain the solution ready to inject into theGC.
 In this work, a new application of the patentedTOTAD interface for online coupling HPLC-HRGCis presented. The interface coupling an HPLC to an HRGC in theKONIK K2 HPLC+HRGC system allows the direct analysis of pesticidesin fruits and vegetables.
The pesticides are extracted from the sample, previouslyground, by a simple stirring and with a few milliliters oforganic solvent placed directly in the injection vial. After theextraction, the supernatant is injected directly into the HPLCsystem and the fraction of interest is transferred to the HRGC byusing the interface. With the addition of the KONIK Robokrom HPLCautosampler and the full control through theKonikrom software, the complete analysis canbe easily automated and performed in a few minutes, limiting theuse of solvents while protecting sample integrity.
 The extraction step and the HPLC and HRGC parameters wereoptimized to obtain a multiresidue method with the selectivityand sensitivity required for the legislation. Finally, the methodwas applied to real samples and results compared in terms ofselectivity and sensitivity with the standard methods ofextraction.
Car emission standards are getting more stringent in the future.
To reduce the emission from combustion engines, the highly dynamic process has to be investigated in order to understand the generation of pollutants better. This means that the gas composition inside the cylinder has to be monitored online for each combustion cycle.
 Part of the online measuring system under development is theLubrisense 1200 mass spectrometer equipped with a CFD optimizedhigh-temperature direct inlet. The inlet-system consists of atransfer capillary, two differential-pressure stages, a heatingsystem, and a pressure control device. Together with a high-speeddata acquisition system (12.5 kHz), this system enablescrank-angle-resolved monitoring of oil evaporation in thecombustion chamber over the full speed torque range of an engine.Rapid online measurements will yield further information tounderstand the process generating pollutants. 
 Enzyme electrodes combine the high sensitivity ofelectrochemical detection with specificity of the enzyme for itssubstrate. Enzyme electrodes have gained popularity in analysis ofclinical, environmental, and food samples due to being relativelysimple, inexpensive, and easy to prepare. Enzyme electrodes alsoprovide rapid analysis, easily regenerate, and are reusable. Adding a rotation to the electrode providescontinuous stirring of the bulk solution and faster transport ofthe analyte to the electrode surface resulting in shorterdetection times and faster overall analysis. However, rotatingdisk enzyme electrodes (RDEEs) are less commonly studied and notcommercially produced. Rotating disk electrodes (RDEs) modifiedwith glucose oxidase (GOx) were constructed as working electrodesfor the amperometric detection of•-D-glucose. The rapid rotation causes theenzyme to leach off over time; a dialysis membrane was added totrap the enzyme on the electrode. The enzyme, glucose oxidase(GOx), which is highly specific for •-D-glucose, wasdirectly immobilized onto the Pt electrode surface through twodifferent immobilization methods. An electrostatic/surfaceadsorption and a polymer entrapment method were both used toimmobilize the enzyme to the Pt RDE electrode. Glucose wasdetected at 650 mV versus Ag wire pseudo-referenceelectrode using a three-electrode configuration including a Ptwire as the auxiliary electrode. Experimental conditions such asdetection potential, pH, temperature, and electrode rotation ratewere optimized for the electrostatic/surface absorption method.The surface area of the electrode was determined usingchronocoulometry. The specificity of the GOx RDEE for•-D-glucose relative to sweeteners structurally close to•-D-glucose was also studied. 
The research was financially supported by the Natural Science Summer Student Research program at Benedictine University.
 The identification of a biological fluid stain at acrime scene as a semen stain is often critical to the assessmentof the crime. This is particularly true in date rape cases, wherethe victim was drugged or incapacitated and have no direct memoryof a sexual assault. If there is no sperm in a sample,identification of a biological fluid stain as semen is difficult.All semen stains, even those devoid of sperm, will contain theprotein prostate specific antigen, or PSA. PSA is at its highestlevel in semen compared to other body fluids. This investigationcombines the use of the chemical specificity associated withimmunotechniques with outstanding sensitivity attained in real-timePCR. Antibodies specific for PSA are immobilized to surfaceof a vessel. When sample is introduced, PSA interacting with thebound antibody is then immobilized. A second detection antibodywith a coupled DNA molecule is added which binds to theimmobilized protein target. The sample vessel is then washed tofree all unbound reagents and the DNA is amplified and detectedwith a fluorescent tag. The real-time PCR was performed to amplifyand detect fluorescently tagged DNA. There is no need toquantitate the DNA; simply the presence of the previouslyimmobilized DNA indicated the presence of PSA. Using threedifferent assemblage strategies provided by TATAA Biocenter, thisstudy compares the efficacy of these assemblages in detecting PSAin semen samples devoid of sperm.
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) ofRu(bpy)32+ was studied in the presence of sugars at gold (Au) and glassy carbon (GC) working electrodes having a surface area of7.06 mm2. In an oxidative-reduction mechanism similar to that of Ru(bpy)32+-Triproplyamine (TPA), a sugar reacts with Ru(bpy)32+ whose excited state(Ru(bpy)32+*) emits light at610 nm. Using cyclic voltammetry in a flow-stop thin layer cell analysis system, an ECL signal is observed from analyte solution containing Ru(bpy)32+, Triton-X, buffer, and a sugar. At both Au and GC electrodes, a linear ECL response is observed with increasing sugar concentration. A limit of detection (LOD) of approximately1 mM was found for all sugars studied. Solutions were prepared in a 1 M phosphate buffer pH 11, 1.0 × 10−8 M Ru(bpy)32+, and 0.01/0.02% (v/v) TX-100.
 Salt marshes located near to industrialized areas can act asnatural sinks for trace metals. Anthropogenic metals, associatedwith suspended particulate matter, can be transported by tidalcurrents and trapped by vegetation with subsequent incorporationinto sediments. Plant roots can interact with the surroundingsediment, exuding oxygen, and organic compounds that influence thedistribution and availability of trace metals; however, the amountof metals taken up by the plants is dependent on the metalavailability in the sediment, and this is modified by the rootactivity. Oxygenation of upper estuarine sediments decreasesrapidly with depth due to the consumption of oxygen in theoxidation process of the organic matter; however, salt marshsediments receive an additional input of oxygen in the subsurfacelayers through the well-developed aerenchyma of salt marsh plants(halophytes) which transports oxygen from leaves to roots andconsequently to the surrounding sediments. This supply of oxygencan alter significantly the redox status of sediments with strongrepercussions on the biogeochemistry of nutrients and traceelements, namely, mercury. The methylation of mercury in salt marshsediments is poorly documented, although abundant microorganismsand strong redox gradients between roots and surrounding sedimentsmay favor that process. Because the sediment environment in saltmarshes is exceedingly complicated, it is pertinent to investigatethe conversion of inorganic mercury into organomercury species. Afully automated GC coupled to atomic fluorescence spectrometerwill be described for the determination of methylmercury insediments and salt marsh plants.
 EPA methods 524.2 and 624 outline the general criteria forvolatile organic compounds in water and wastewater analysis. Inrecent years, laboratories have run into an instrumental barrierin their efforts to increase throughput and productivity for theanalysis of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Conventional purgeand trap technology had reached a limit where the speed could notbe increased further without severely affecting analyticalperformance and quality. This paper compares the standard purgeand trap technology and the new tekmar purge and trapshowing that reduced run time can be achieved while maintainingEPA compliance with improved data quality.
 EPA methods for the determination of volatileorganic compounds in soil following method 5030 and 8260parameters can be a challenge when trying to ensure the fastestpossible run time without sacrificing your analytical integrity.Two main aspects that are often compromised when optimizing apurge and trap concentrator and autosampler are carryover andlow-end sensitivity. Teledyne Tekmar is offering a new approach topurge and trap optimization that is achieving unprecedentedperformance. Data presented demonstrate advances in analyticalabilities without sacrificing any data integrity. 
A fast method for real-time reaction monitoring is demonstrated using capillary chromatography and a new automated reaction monitoring tool—“the sipper.” Aliquots are taken automatically from the reaction vessel using a fully programmable method. After online dilution the “sipper” transfers the sample to a capillary HPLC system where fast chromatography is performed. Monitoring reactions in this way allows a full time course of the reaction to be plotted so that conditions may be optimized.
It is only recently that software tools for liquid chromatography have gained a foothold in the HPLC/IC field. Several software programs compete for the market and appeal to the user community. Thus,today's situation is similar to that of office software tools several years ago.
In the latter field, a tremendous concentration process has left over only very few products that were able to resist the tough competition and persisted on the market. As a result, these software tools have become standards and everyday tools for an overwhelming majority of users. On the other hand, users see their choices drastically reduced.
Given that background, are we heading towards a similar, quasimonopolized software situation in the field of IC? Certainly customers wish to select among different software solutions the one whose features correspond best to their applications.
It might be the actual spreading of a given product and goodmarketing pushing a certain software environment that mainlydecide about winning or losing customers. Although highlyimportant, these points will not be treated in ourpresentation.
We concentrate on features that future IC software must provide in order to keep its place within the shrinking group of high-end products. Accordingly, we highlight decisive software characteristics that are crucial for performance as well as for user acceptance. Examples are as follows:
 excellent visualization of configuration, current determination, method, instrument control, and databases;intelligent recognition of instruments and accessories; control of a practically unlimited number of devices by mouse click; management of all devices with one time program, including parallel tasks, sample preparation, sample processing, and so forth; efficient algorithms for data evaluation and databases; user-based client-server systems; GLP and monitoring features; potential for growth regarding the capabilities of the instruments, the laboratory, the methods in use, and the data already recorded; flexibility ranging from “one button IC” for the unskilled user up to the administrator level; standardized interfaces: AIA import/export; straightforward, self-explaining dialogs for complex instruments and tasks.

We expect that software products will further contribute to a healthy variety of solutions if they succeed in managing the complexity of modern ion chromatography in an intelligent way.
Phase optimized liquid chromatography (POPLC) is a method tofind out the optimal stationary phase composition for eachparticular separation. Due to the fact that retention times areadditive, different stationary phase segments are coupled togetherto create the column with the best overall performance for eachparticular separation. The retention time for each analyte iscontrolled by the use of the best selective column for thispurpose. This column is calculated by computer software. For thecalculation of the optimal column composition, the measuring of theretention data for each of the compounds of the mixture on each ofthe different stationary phases is required.
 In this paper, we demonstrate the optimization of a separationby coupling different stationary phases of different brands. Itcan be shown that an extreme improvement in selectivity can beachieved just by coupling existing columns from the shelf. An easyprocedure of how to apply the software in daily method developmentwill be presented.
 The continuous rise in costs for pharmaceuticalproducts forces us to take a closer look at traditional workflows.So far in the early stages of drug discovery, the focus was on thechemical effects, leaving the analysis of the physical effectsusing formulation and solubility studies as the last link in theprocess. 
 This approach could lead to the terrible consequence ofmissing important required properties for dosage, solubility,storage, and so forth. All the money spent on the discovery so farwould have been totally wasted.
 To avoid more disappointment and financial disaster in thefinal development stage, it is crucial to have already eliminatedunsuitable compounds at an earlier stage. New workflows andhardware systems are required which enable us to deal with thesmall volumes of material available at the early discovery stagein order to study the physical and chemical properties.
 Zinsser Analytic has developed an automatic workbench whichenables you to execute a workflow to test  formulation conditionsin parallel. The reactor is based on the microplate format for 8to 24 vials with different compounds or different testingparameters. Tools for pH measurement and adjustment, precisiondosage, weighing, and mixing (even of highly viscous media)are provided. Optical control, evaporation, filtration, and HPLC/LC-MS integration can be provided enabling you to carry out yourwell-proven formulation methods and solubility tests on a singleplatform.
 The blending station from Zinsser Analytic is a new automatedsystem designed for the preparation of complex blends of viscousmedia, ideal for developing high-throughput liquid formulationtesting experiments. Specially designed pumps, liquid deliverytools, and powerful software allow high-throughput blending withoutcompromise in precision or accuracy.
 The blending station is based on a liquid handling workbenchwith two independently operating arms. Each arm is equipped withthe viscous media dispenser and a gripper. Gripping tools aredesigned for transportation of the blending vessels and the tipsof the viscous media tools. Bulk reagents in 5-liter cans arestored under the workbench or outside the cabinet. A pump towerunder the platform with 9-high precision rotating piston pumpsdelivers the reagents from the reservoirs and dispenses them via aspecial dispensing head into the blending vessels waiting on thetwo balances. These two precision 4-place weighing cells areintegrated in the middle of the deck of the workbench. Theblending vessels are transported by the robotic arms from thestorage racks to the balances,  tare weighed, filled with theviscous liquid, and then brought back to the storage rack.
Standard low-cost glass jars are used as blending vessels(60 mL, 150 mL, 200 mL, and 300 mL). Three individually controlled heated zones on the deck(80°C, 50°C, and room temperature)contain racks with the blending vessels, source containers for low-volume materials,and the dispensing cartridges of the viscous dispensing tool.
 A repetitive sampling online titration system (Figure 2) wasconfigured using a laboratory benchtop titrator by adding pumps, asampling valve, and an analog output to communicate with a PLCprocess controller. All of the components are available off theshelf. The system has provision for automatically calibrating theelectrode and for running check samples. Precision for determiningacidity was better than 0.5% rsd.
 In the recent years, influenza virus H5N1 is being closelymonitored by public health authorities for being a health problem.For molecular detection of this virus, automation is also becomingan important tool. At Aurora Biomed Inc., automated samplepreparation for the detection of viral RNA from influenza A/H5N1was developed with a commercially available kit. Liquid handlingfor various components of the kit was carried by the workstationfor 50 μL assays in sterile500 μL reaction tubes.The reaction tubes were subsequently taken to the thermocyclerwhere reverse transcription and amplification took place in thesame buffer system.
 The amplified products of about 190, 190, 107 bp on3% agarose gel indicated that the workstation can be usedfor the kit. RNA being very sensitive to degradation and PCR being asensitive process to volume, concentration of different assaycomponents, and contamination issues, the results showed that theworkstation conformed to the precautionary requirements of thekit. 
Analytical chemistry constitutes a significant component of the drug discovery and development process. Many of the traditional techniques employed for the evaluations of compound physicochemical properties are often inadequate in modern HTS due to the throughput and sample amount limitations imposed by these approaches. Other approaches can provide adequate throughput, but they are not sensitive to compound purity and identity. Micro parallel liquid chromatography (μPLC) offers the advantages of a separation-based approach (such as HPLC and LC-MS) and enables high-throughput chemical analysis for the characterization of ADMET parameters and physicochemical properties. The approach has also been shown to reduce sample consumption, solvent usage, and waste generation.
The μPLC system employed for the determinationshighlighted in this presentation is equipped with 24 parallelcolumns for liquid chromatography, each with its own sampleintroduction port and exit port for connection to detector(s) ofchoice. Flow from a binary solvent delivery system is dividedevenly across 24 channels and results in 1/24th of the programmedpump flow rate through each column. Samples are introduced to thecolumns (housed in a cartridge) by a multichannel autosampler,which is configured to sample from either 96-well or 384-well SBSstandard plates.
In this presentation, results from the μPLC characterization of compound lipophilicity (based on logP values), solubility (thermodynamic and kinetic), purity, and stability will be discussed and compared with those obtained with conventional HPLC instrumentation and with other commonly used techniques (such as nephelometry, flow cytometry, and UV plate readers for the evaluation of compound solubility).
 A recent innovation in mass spectrometry is theability to record mass spectra on ordinary samples, in theirnative environment, without sample preparation or preseparation bycreating ions outside the instrument. In desorption electrosprayionization (DESI), electrically charged droplets are directed atthe ambient object of interest; they release ions from thesurface, which are then transferred through the air into aconventional mass spectrometer. Extremely rapid analysis iscoupled with high sensitivity and high chemical specificity; evencomplex matrices such as blood, serum, urine, and tissue can beanalyzed directly. These characteristics are advantageouslyapplied to high-throughput metabolomics, natural productsdiscovery, pharmaceutical analysis, and explosives detection amongother applications. DESI is applied to the rapid direct analysisof plant tissues; all the previously reported alkaloids have beendetected in C. maculatum along with fifteen out of nineteen knownalkaloids for Datura stramonium. Positive and negative ion DESIsare used to characterize pharmaceutical samples formulated astablets, ointments, and liquids at speeds of up to 3 samples persecond. For metabolomics applications, DESI results are combinedwith NMR and advanced statistical tools to differentiate lungcancer from control samples by studying the metabolite content ofmouse urine. Inborn errors of metabolism are being studied by thismethod. Breast cancer (profiling) and prostrate cancer (hormoneresponse study) serum samples are being investigated todifferentiate the different cancer types and study diseaseprogression. DESI can be used as a high-throughput screening ordiagnostic tool in targeted metabolomics applications. Futurepossible uses of DESI could involve in vivo clinical analysis,early diagnosis, and adaptation to miniature massspectrometers.

There is an increasing demand, within the pharmaceutical industry, for higher-throughput pharmacokinetic and metabolic screening. The rationale behind this undertaking lies in the advancement of lead compounds that have the highest probability for success. We have approached this task from a drug metabolism/pharmacokinetics perspective with Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as our principal tool in an effort to satisfy these demands.
 We have implemented a novel pharmacokinetic paradigm calledcassette-accelerated rapid rat screening (CARRS) and a similarassay for monkeys and dogs. This rugged assay comprises the use offast LC-MS/MS and highly organized interdepartmental collaborationbetween chemistry, animal dosing facility, and drug metabolism toscreen 60 new compounds per week. In order to achieve rapidturnaround time, high quality, and informative data, we haveutilized a variety of approaches that will be discussed in thispaper.
 Our most recent approach utilizes ultra performance liquidchromatography (UPLC) tandem mass spectrometry. UPLC providesimproved chromatographic separation and sensitivity whilediminishing carryover. We have used the waters acquity UPLC inconjunction with both the Micromass Premier and TSQ Quantum triplequadrupole mass spectrometers. We have developed a genericapproach to rapidly provide pharmacokinetic information by usingautomated method development software such as QuanOptimize andQuickQuan. This EZ-CARRS approach has facilitated significantlyimproved turnaround time including same day reporting of data.Additionally, we have introduced a metabolic profiling assay (inplasma) that is connected to the CARRS assay, allowing for theroutine profiling of both common and unique metabolites includingestimated AUCs without an authentic standard.
These approaches have had a major impact within drug discovery in giving program teams the ability to make decisions on the fly.
 Reactive drug intermediates can causehepatotoxicity. It can be caused through covalent modification of key proteins. Topredict the potential of in vivo reactive intermediate formation,we have developed an in vitro assay in which compounds areincubated with microsomes fortified with glutathione (GSH) andcofactor NADPH. The resulting GSH conjugates were commonlydetected using positive electrospray and neutral loss (129 Da) ofpyroglutamic acid from the [M + H]+ ion of the GSHconjugates. However, not all classes of GSH adduct afforded thisneutral loss upon collision-induced dissociation. In this study,12 commercially available compounds were incubated in human livermicrosomes. Samples were run using constant neutral loss (CNL) of129 in positive mode, and precursor ion scan of 272 in negativemode (–Prec) followed by enhancing resolution (+ER) toswitch from negative to positive mode, and information dependenceacquisition (IDA) of the detected GSH conjugates using enhancedproduct ion scan (+EPI) on the API 4000 Q-Trap equipped with turboion spray source. When CNL was used, GSH adducts of 10 out of 12compounds could be detected. In contrast, GSH adducts of all 12compounds were readily detected in human liver microsomes using–Prec. Although all the GSH adducts were detected using–Prec of 272 Da, the relative intensities varied. Thesemight be dependent on the stability of the adducts, the amount formed,and collision energy used. Enhanced product ion spectra were alsoacquired for identification and confirmation simultaneously. Inconclusion, –Prec of the 272 fragments, followed by ER andIDA EPI, provides a sensitive and specific analytical techniquethat can be applied for detecting, structurally identifying, andconfirming GSH conjugates of various unknown compounds.
Characterization of petroleum fuels is of importance in forensic arson investigations. Comparison of a fuel sample recovered from a crime scene to one in a suspect's possession is difficult due to the complex chemical nature of the fuel. Currently, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a valuable technique for analyzing petroleum samples, such as diesel. Chemometric methods can be used to statistically classify or group fuel samples based on the chemical fingerprint from the GC-MS.
 Twenty-five diesel samples were collected from the Lansing,Michigan area and analyzed by GC-MS. Sample components wereidentified from the mass spectra by comparison with a spectraldatabase. Mass-to-charge ratios were identified to representaliphatic (m/z 57) and aromatic compounds (m/z 91). The dieselsamples were evaluated using both the total ions (TICs) andextracted ion chromatograms (EICs) for the representative m/zvalues. The chromatograms were retention times aligned, normalized,and mean-centered prior to chemometric analysis.
 Pearson correlation measures the strength of the associationbetween two chromatograms, where a correlation coefficient nearunity indicates that the diesel samples are similar in origin.Correlation coefficients for the TICs ranged from 0.889 to 0.996for samples of known similar origin, while those of dissimilarorigin were as low as 0.753. Correlation of the EICs providedgreater discrimination of diesels, with samples of known similarorigin ranging from 0.966 to 0.994 and 0.968 to 0.995, while thoseof dissimilar origin were as low as 0.888 and 0.652 for m/z 57 andm/z 91, respectively.
 Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate techniquethat reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, while retainingthe important characteristics of the original data. PCA of theTICs suggests the formation of two separate clusters with twoisolated outlying samples. While similar clustering is observedfor each of the EICs, greater variance is observed within eachcluster. The distinct clustering suggests chemical similarity, asone cluster consistently contains only one brand of diesel. Takentogether, these methods show promise for the association offorensic fuel samples of similar origin and the discrimination ofsamples of different origin.
 One of the major scientific challenges of the 21stcentury will be determining the relationship between the humangenome and the risks of developing major diseases such as cancer,diabetes, arthritis, and so forth. Understanding the relationshipbetween the genome, the proteome, and the expressed endogenousmetabolites (metabolic phenotyping or metabotyping) requires thedevelopment of ever more powerful analytical chemistry techniquesand data interpretation tools. In the metabonomics arena, thistask is normally carried out by proton NMR, GC/MS, or LC/MS, thelatter with exact mass analysis, and multivariate statisticalanalysis. Interesting ions in the LC/MS data  highlighted bythe multivariate analysis are subsequently reanalyzed by usingLC/MS/MS for structural ID. Traditionally, mass spectrometerslacked the MS/MS duty cycle required to collect product ion scaninformation for thousands of metabolite ions simultaneously. Inthis paper, however, we will describe how the application of ultraperformance LC  with thesimultaneous acquisition of both precursor and product ion MS datahas been combined with novel statistical heterospectroscopy,and applied to this task. Urine samples were collected from twostudies: (1) male control and male diabetic ratesover a 16-weektime period, (2) male rates following theadministration of Hydrazine, at 1 and 80 mg/kg. Thesamples were analyzed by UPLC/MS using the simultaneousacquisition of alternating low and high collision cell energy,resulting in significant increase in MS duty cycle followed bythis new form of statistic on the resulting data. Thereversed-phase UPLC/MS analysis resulted in chromatographic peakwidths in the order of 2 seconds at the base. This new approachrevealed extra information about the dataset and allowed the easyidentification of the precursor and product ions. It was possibleusing mass deficiency filters to link these ions to obtain MS/MSstructural information.
 Microscale separations such as capillary liquidchromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) offershorter analysis times, low reagent and solvent consumption,increased reliability, and high performance over traditionalseparations. The use of microfluidic devices to perform thesetypes of separations provides advantages in instrumentalintegration and portability. The increasing popularity ofcapillary LC and CE over the last 25 years and the more recenttransition to microfluidic devices in the last 15 years havecreated a need for detection systems that are amenable tominiaturization. Due to the low flow rates and very small volumesused in capillary LC and CE, these systems must provide very highmass sensitivity and chemical selectivity and have the ability tomeasure analytes of interest in intended applications withoutprior chemical derivatization. Additionally, detectors should beeasy to use, possess high stability and reproducibility, and should beeasily fabricated in appropriate dimensions at a reasonablecost.
 Electrochemical detection is very mass sensitive. Manyanalytes, including many endogenous neurotransmitters orneuroactive compounds, are natively electrochemically active, whichallows them to be measured by electrochemical detection.Electrochemical detection scales very well with reduced samplevolume, making it amenable to miniaturization. Progress atEksigent Technologies toward the development of a microfabricatedelectrochemical detection system will be discussed.

 In recent years, electrochemical (EC) detection has become awell-established methodology for use in microfabricatedlab-on-a-chip (LOC) analysis systems. The focus of our group hasbeen the use of conventional microfabrication techniques to createfully integrated LOC-EC devices in which all electrodes areincorporated directly onto the chip during the fabricationprocess. To date, such on-chip LOC-EC devices have usuallyemployed platinum EC electrodes because this material is wellsuited to these microfabrication procedures [1]. However, to facilitate more diverse applications, itwould be useful to have access to a wider variety of electrodematerials, in particular, carbon.
 This presentation will address our effort to make a LOC devicemade completely of carbon electrodes. In order to reach this goal,three approaches have been studied. Initially, carbon films were deposited by means of both e-beam(EB) evaporation [2]  and directcurrent (DC) sputtering techniques [3]. The properties of the resulting electrodes, in termsof thickness, adhesion, and conductivity, were characterized alongwith their voltammetry with several model redox systems. Althoughthe carbon films resulting from the sputtering technique did notprove to be suitable electrodes, carbon films obtained by the EBevaporation presented reasonable electrochemical properties.Finally, carbon electrodes were patterned onto fused quartzsubstrates by means of pyrolysis of photoresist [4, 5]. Bychoosing the appropriate type of photoresist and adjusting theparameters of application of photoresist, as well as pyrolysisconditions (time and temperature), carbon films with thicknessvarying from 0.5 to 1 micron were obtained. These carbonelectrodes presented electrochemical properties analogous toglassy carbon electrodes. The top of chip and the channels, werepatterned onto soda lime glass.
A low temperature, stamp-and-stick bonding technique was developed for assembly of the final LOC device. Several applications of the resulting chips will be demonstrated.
 High concentrations of heavy metal ions (e.g., Cd2+, Pb2+) in the human body can lead to numeroushealth problems. Measurement of these toxins in biological fluids(e.g., blood and urine) can be used as an indicator of chronicexposure or a single incidence of a high level exposure. Therefore,it is important to have available analytical methods that cansensitively, reproducibly, and stably measure these contaminants inbiological fluids.
 Anodic stripping voltammetry is a useful method for monitoringheavy metal ions as the method generally provides a wide lineardynamic range, low limit of detection, and multimetal analysiscapability. We have demonstrated that boron-doped diamond is asuitable electrode for metal ion analysis in water, soil, andsludge samples. Herein, we report on the use of this electrode andmethod to analyze metal ions in biological fluids. Directanalysis in urine simulant is possible; however, blood containsmany biomolecules (e.g., proteins and peptides) that can adsorb onthe electrode surface and inhibit the response. We report on thedetection figures of merit for analysis of  Cd2+ urine simulant and preliminary approachesto prevent electrode fouling in analyses of Pb2+ in blood samples.
 The aim of any analytical system is to providehighly accurate results in quantitative analysis. In ICP-AES, useof multiline analysis is an efficient way to enhance reliabilityof the concentration results. Besides an efficient use of theinformation emitted by the ICP, that is,165–800 nm spectra, the use of several lines perelement allows the analyst to verify possible outliers due tounexpected interferences, and to increase the concentration range.Although any system equipped with a solid-state multichanneldetector can perform multiline analysis, this is not sufficientto obtain reliable element concentrations. Dedicated tools arenecessary to take full benefit of the multiline analysispotential and to facilitate the task of the analyst. HORIBA JobinYvon has, therefore, developped several interactive assistancetools to be used with a CCD-based ICP system. Multiline selectionis then facilitated by using a proprietary ICP-based spectra database containing not only wavelengths, but also sensitivity andline width. The base is used through a filtering procedure toselect lines with appropriate sensitivity and free from spectralinterferences. An interactive display tool combines single-elementspectra as a function of the expected composition of the sample.It is, then, possible to visualize the selected analyte lines andtheir vicinity within the matrix environment for a finalvalidation. Moreover, because the display tool can include blankspectra, it can also be used to select background corrections.Once concentration measurements for each line have been obtained,an ANOVA-based statistical data processing tool is used to verifypossible outliers. At the end, a reliable, single concentrationper element is given.
Olsalazine sodium is used as one of the rawmaterials for a commercial product of a major internationalpharmaceutical company. The European Pharmacopoeia provides amonograph method for the quantitation of olsalazine sodium andknown impurities by reversed phase HPLC. However, the earlygeneration silica column specified in the method is prone tostationary phase degradation at the prescribed pH. Additionally,this method has an excessive total assay time of 55 minutes. Thecompany's analytical R&D department was taskedwith developing an improved HPLC method that would (i) be able toresolve and quantitate olsalazine sodium and all nine knownimpurities, (ii) have an acceptable total assay time, and (iii)perform with the robustness required for normal use as aquality-control method. The work presented describes how thesegoals were successfully accomplished using a fully automated HPLCmethod development experimentation software platform that hadintegrated multiple column and solvent switching and DOE-basedexperimental design, creation, and implementation capabilities. Thissoftware also enabled the determination of overall methodrobustness using a built-in robustness calculation algorithm.Graphical response surface graphs indicated significantinteractions between the method study parameters, and the resultantmethod, generated by the automated optimizer, indicated thatcomplete resolution of the olsalazine and all nine impurity peakscould be achieved within 34 minutes at a flow rate of0.5 mL/min and a final organic solvent concentration of40%.
Chiral chromatographic method screening proves to be an effective tool for rapidly developing chiral separation methods. We have established in our laboratory SFC, normal phase HPLC, and reversed-phase HPLC chiral screening tools, which provide >90% screening success rate and generate >500 chiral separation methods per year for chiral analysis and preparative chiral purifications in support of drug discovery and pharmaceutical process research.
 To explore the opportunities to further increase theefficiency of chiral chromatographic method screening anddevelopment, an in-house chiral applications database wasdeveloped, implemented, and fully integrated with the screeningworkflows. The database software allowed us to streamline severaltasks, including archiving sample and structure information,importing chromatographic data from various chromatographyplatforms, inputting screening results, and generating screeningreports. Practical implementation of the databases to assistchiral method development is also being evaluated, with particularemphasis on searching strategies. The in-house chiral applicationsdatabase and a commercially available database of chiral methodsare searched simultaneously for prediction of chromatographicseparation conditions with new pharmaceutical compounds. Searcheswere based on chemical structure similarities, derived from purelystructural considerations as well as predicted physicochemicalparameters. This approach on the creation and effective mining ofpreviously collected data in order to more accurately targetscreening experiments will potentially reduce the experimentalspace examined to areas that have the highest probability ofsuccess.
Changes within the laboratory and test and measurement equipment industry are driving technical changes at the control system level. Changes such as manufacturer consolidation and the increased use of traditional test and measurement equipment within integrated manufacturing environments have created new control system issues. As a result, a different control system approach is now required in order to effectively meet product needs.
 In addition, the companies that evolve as a result ofconsolidation also need to increase the flexibility and reusecapacity of currently developed products. Increasingly, they mustrely on product line architecture approaches that enhance theintegration and affordability of new technology platforms.
 This paper specifically illustrates how changes in bothbusiness and deployment environments impact the underlyingtechnology of test equipment and challenge the production ofnext-generation products. 
 It also examines new engineering techniques, such as valuedriven analysis (VDA) and architecture tradeoffs analysismethodology (ATAM) and how they can be applied to develop newproducts. This paper will show how, using ATAM, it is possible toevaluate both existing and new control system architecturesagainst new equipment drivers such as reliability, speed,flexibility, connectivity, and enhanceability. This paper uses casestudies to demonstrate the use of variability and commonalityconstructs to effectively support a disparate product line with asingle underlying technology platform. 
Identification of neuropeptides and hormones in brain tissues using conventional proteomics approaches is challenging. Normally, one of the first steps is to homogenize the tissue, greatly diluting the peptides produced in specialized cells. In other cases, the presence of other peptides and proteins interferes with the identification of neuropeptides. The challenge becomes even more pronounced when identifying neuropeptides from species for which genomic information or annotation of neuropeptide genes is scarce. In this case, verification of neuropeptide by direct sequencing becomes necessary.
 We have identified over 36 neuropeptide genes in the honey beeby the combined use of homology searches using BLAST,searching for pertinent gene features such as signal peptide andpresence of basic amino acids, as well codon scanning forrepeating patterns. This combined approach enabled the discoveryof neuropeptide genes not identified by gene finding programs suchas GENSCAN and FGENEH, and reconciled differences in prediction ofthe same gene by two or more gene predictors. In order to aid suchapproaches, we have also developed a statistical algorithm(NeuroPred) that predicts cleavage sites in insects,mollusk, and mammals and reports expected molecular masses with orwithout putative post translational modifications.
We are testing these approaches using several newly sequencedgenomes. For example, the Tribolium castaneum(red flour beetle) genome sequencing project by BCM-HGSC hasreached annotation stage, with the second assembly alreadycompleted. By applying gene finding strategies alreadyimplemented in the honey bee, we are identifying neuropeptidegenes from Tribolium castaneum. Moreover, using NeuroPred, wepredict proteolytic products of the predicted genes, therebyproducing a list of most likely neuropeptides to be confirmed bymass spectrometry.
 Conventional chromatography follows the theory of the VanDemeter curve where the best separation is achieved for helium ata linear velocity of 20 to 50 cm/sec and low column flowrates of 1 mL/min. Several experiments have been run totest the effect of higher carrier gas flows by GC/MS. Theseelevated flow rates of 3 mL/min require fast-scanningspeeds of 5 scans/sec or1 618 μ/sec. The actual capacity forthe stationary phase can be increased with these higher flowrates, allowing for the use of thinner films. Run times areshortened and final oven temperatures can be lowered, reducing therun time and column bleed. Another interesting advantage wasobserved in minimizing irreversible absorption of active compoundssuch as pentachlorophenol and organophosphorus pesticides byshortening the time spent in the analytical column. 
 Another parameter studied was the flow of the carrier gasthrough the inlet during injection of the sample. Surge pressuresplitless injections force more of the sample into the column andminimize breakdown by reducing the stress of a flash vaporizationin a constant temperature injection. A split injection does thesame thing, although a more sensitive mass spectrometer isrequired. 
 No adverse effects were noted in precision, sensitivity, orseparation at elevated column flow rates and surge pressuresplitless injections. The split injection actually enhanced theseparation of more volatile compounds like N-nitrosodimethylamine(NDMA) and pyridine. The target lists studied in this project werethose in EPA methods 8270 and 525.
The use of automated searching of mass spectra forspecific patterns allows the GC-TOFMS system to be used as aselective detection system for numerous types of compounds. Whenapplied to the full chromatogram, this automatic search capabilitymay be used to identify chlorinated or brominated contaminantssuch as solvents or pesticides in foods or environmental samples.With the use of GCxGC-TOFMS, trace components with specificfunctionality can be identified. Sulfur-containing compounds suchas pesticides or minor flavor ingredients can be identified incomplex mixtures, such as flavoring mixtures. This workdemonstrates the use of the GC-TOFMS system as a specific detectorwith ability to provide mass spectral identification of compoundscontaining specific groups.
As fossil fuel has become more difficult to obtain, there has been renewed interest in developing fuel from alternate sources. One alternative fuel source being investigated and used in parts of the world is oil from agricultural products such as corn, rapeseed, or soy. Unmodified, or straight vegetable oil can be used as fuel in adapted diesel engines. Unfortunately, because vegetable oil is more viscous than diesel fuel, as much as 10–20 times, it can cause problems in such engines over time. To create biodiesel, a fuel with a viscosity closer to diesel, oil can be modified. Thermally cracking, or controlled pyrolysis, of bio-oil decreases its molecular weight and is thereby effective in converting oil to a more useable fuel, like biodiesel. However, because of complicated pyrolysis mechanisms, different pyrolysis conditions yield different products. This poster describes the use of pyrolysis GC/MS by chemists to study various pyrolysis conditions and their effects on different vegetable oils. Chromatograms of pyrolyzed vegetable oils are compared to chromatograms of diesel fuel to determine optimal pyrolysis conditions.
Retention times and response levels for GC/MS analysis can vary significantly between instruments, or for an individual instrument depending on its condition. Quantitative analysis normally requires, as a first step, the analysis of analytical standards to verify chromatographic retention times and establish calibration curves.
 With the introduction of the “positive list”system in Japan and the corresponding increase in the number oftarget pesticides to nearly 700, not only the preparation of analyticalstandards is  expensive and time-consuming, but alsoavailability of pesticide standards is frequently a problem. 
 In this study, the necessary parameters for quantitativeanalysis (retention times, response factors, and mass spectra)were standardized. Reliable semiquantitative analysis wasdemonstrated without the use of calibration standards. A databaseand supporting software were created for analysis of pesticideresidues in food.
Use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as a tool for forensic chemistry analyses can result in considerable volumes of data to review and evaluate (or interpret). With pressures to reduce evidence backlogs and meet deadlines, data review can create a bottleneck. Software tools developed specifically for forensic applications can streamline data review and reporting, and thus reduce or remove the data review bottleneck. Software that addresses specific tasks or sample types ensures that results and reports provide the best fit between the data and the reporting needs. The use of different software tools was evaluated using GC/MS for the following disciplines: forensic toxicology, fire/arson, and controlled substances. These software programs were compared against standard data processing software to ensure that the best fit for each section of forensic chemistry was provided. Analytical validation of the software was performed, to evaluate reliability, applicability, accuracy of results, and subjective ease of use. Specific benefits that resulted from the use of each program were quantified in terms of time saved by the analyst for reviewing and reporting data. The results include a matrix for effectively matching software applications to analytical challenges in order to improve the workflow within the forensic lab while still maintaining integrity and validity of results. Overall, it was determined that matching software programs to specific analytical tasks can reduce casework time and improve sample throughput.
 The analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) characterizesthe lipid fractions in food, making them one of the most importantapplications in food quality control. Although most edible fatsand oils contain primarily linear saturated fatty acids, branchedfatty acids, mono-, di-, and higher unsaturated fatty acids canalso occur. Additional information about lipid fraction can beobtained by determining the position of double bond(s) andgeometric configuration cis/trans. Whereas trans isomers haveadverse health effects (an increase risk of coronary heartdisease), the cis isomers typically do not. In fact, the US Foodand Drug Administration recently amended its regulations onnutritional labeling to include the amount of trans fatty acidsin the nutrition facts panel of the food (US FDA 21 CFR Part 101,Section 101.62).
The most common analytical tool to measure fatty acids in food is GC analysis after methylation to improve their volatility. Two critical aspects of the global method need to be optimized: speed of analysis to maximize throughput and selectivity of GC method to ensure resolution and reliable quantification of cis/trans pairs.
In this work, a method for automatic methylation of fatty acids with KONIK ROBOKROM autosampler and analysis of the corresponding FAMEs by the KONIK HRGC + MS Q12 system working in CI mode are presented.
 Automatic derivatization parameters (reagent volumes,temperature, and time of derivatization, etc.) and GC-CI-MSparameters (temperature of the source and reactive gas type andflow) were optimized to obtain better selectivity in thequantification of cis/trans pairs. Quality parameters of FAMEsanalysis were established. Finally, GC-CI-MS was applied to tracelevel determination of FAMEs in biological matrices (animal feed,dairy products, vegetable, oils and other processed foods) andresults compared in terms of selectivity and sensitivity with theanalysis by GC-EI-MS.
 Static headspace systems offer a simple and robustmethod of introducing volatile organic compounds into a GC.However, one of the drawbacks of static headspace analysis is thatthe technique cannot provide the sensitivity necessary to detectcompounds at trace levels since only a portion of the equilibratedheadspace vapor can be injected. Trace detection analysisgenerally requires much larger volumes of headspace vapor and theability to preconcentrate these compounds of interest prior to GCanalysis.
 This paper will present the analytical advantages of a staticheadspace system equipped with a dual sampling needle capable ofdynamically sweeping the headspace and concentrating the compoundsprior to injection. The sensitivity of this type of headspacesampling is now proportional to the total mass of the compoundspresent in the vapor phase rather than equilibrium concentrationof the headspace.
 The advantages of this sampling method will be demonstrated bypresenting sub-ppb-level results in a variety of condensedmatrices. The full evaporative technique will also be evaluatedsince the dynamic sweeping injection technique is capable ofcreating enough headspace volume to overcome sensitivity issuesassociated with very small sample sizes.
 Volatiles sampling using sorbent technology haspermitted sensitive and automated analysis of compounds from awide range of sample matrices. By collecting the organics from alarge sample volume and then thermally desorbing them into theGC/MS, parts-per-billion and even parts-per-trillion levelanalyses are possible. Selection of sorbent type and tube sizehelps in the development of techniques specific for a particulartype of compounds or sample matrix. Consequently, the sametechnology may be used for the extremely demanding analysis ofchemical warfare volatiles in air, industrialhygiene/environmental contaminants such as TICS, TIMS, solventsand combustion products, and even aroma compounds from foods andpackaging.
 This paper presents data on a unique system, comprised of athermal desorption autosampler, a volatiles concentrator, and aGC/MS, which may be equipped with a variety of sample tube sizesto optimize the process for different applications. The tubes maybe filled with different sorbent materials, and the desorptiontimes and temperatures are independently controlled for each tube.
 Application of the system is shown for several sample types,including typical surrogates for chemical warfare agents, aromaticand chlorinated solvents, and aroma compounds collected from theheadspace of foods.
 The physical and chemical performances of mostpolymeric materials gradually degrade due to external effects suchas heating, photoradiation oxidative atmosphere, and mechanicalstress. During the degradation process, not only the decomposedcompounds formed from the sample but also the structuralalternation of the samples has been important targets to analyze.By getting this information, it would be possible to prepare theadvanced materials by modifying their molecular structures and/orselecting appropriate additives. For these analyses, a newanalytical method has to be developed. 
 In this work, a new analytical instrument using an onlinemicro-ultraviolet (UV) radiator combined with themultifunctional microfurnace pyrolyzer (PY-2010iD, Frontier Lab)with capillary column GC/MS was developed. A UV beam was spottedon a small amount of polymer sample set in the pyrolyzer through afiber cable. The evolved gas from the irradiated polymer samplewas analyzed online  by GC, and then the residual polymer samplewas pyrolyzed in the pyrolyzer to give a specific pyrogram. Basedon both pieces of information obtained, the deterioration mechanism of thepolymeric material during irradiation and the effect of additivessuch as photostabilizer and UV-absorber can be evaluated usingsubmilligram order of minute polymer sample with relatively shorttest period compared with that by conventional technique such as aweather meter. Here the basic performance of this system wasexamined using typical polymer materials such as polystyrene andpolypropylene.
 Many fully automated liquid-phasemicroextraction (LPME) techniques, including static headspace LPME(HS-LPME), exposed dynamic HS-LPME, unexposed dynamic HS-LPME,static direct-immersed LPME (DI-LPME), dynamic DI-LPME, and hollowfiber-protected LPME (HF-LPME), are described in this study. Allsteps of these LPME techniques, including the filling of theextraction solvent, sample transfer and agitation, withdrawing thesolvent to a syringe, and introducing the extraction phase into theinjector, were autoperformed with a commercial CTC CombiPalautosampler, Critical experimental factors, including temperature,choice of extraction solvent, solvent volume, plunger movementrate, and extraction time, were investigated. Among the threeHS-LPME techniques that were evaluated, the exposed dynamicHS-LPME technique provided the best performance, compared to theunexposed dynamic HS-LPME and static HS-LPME approaches. ForDI-LPME, the dynamic process can enhance the extraction efficiencyand the achieved method precision is comparable with the staticDI-LPME technique. The precision of the fully automated HF-LPME isquite acceptable (RSD values below 6.8%), and thesensitivity of this method is comparable with the DI-LPMEapproaches, although only part of the extraction phase isintroduced for analysis. The fully automated LPME techniques aremore accurate and more convenient, and the reproducibilityachieved eliminates the need for an internal standard to improvethe method precision.
A method was developed to determine traceconcentrations of individual PAHs and OCPs in sewage sludgesamples, which were taken from three different wastewatertreatment plants (WWTPs) in the area of Kuwait. The new method was based onusing GC-ion trap MS techniques for the simultaneous determinationof OPCs and PAHs, and the sludge samples were extracted withaccelerated solvent extraction (ASE) using 1:1 (v/v) dichloromethane (DCM): n-hexane solvent mixture.The extracts were passed through a multilayer column containingsilica/Al2O3, followed bygel permeation chromatography (GPC) column in order to eliminatethe large interference caused by organic compounds and lipids. Sulfur was treated by anondestructive method such as using copper bars which enhancethe removal of sulfur.
 GC-ion-MS-MS optimization of several variables such as CID,ESL, and waveform was done perfectly in order to obtain exactfragment ions for each analyte and enhance the sensivity ofinterested analyte, which was in the range of ppb. However, thecorrelation (R2) of the calibration curves of the analyte wasexceeding 0.999.
 Average concentrations of 7.8 mg/kg for the sum of 16PAHs, and 39.5 μg/kg of the sum of the 16 OCPs werefound in the sewage sludge. Compared to a previous studyperformed in our laboratory using a different analytical method,PAHs are still present in similar concentrations, and there is no evidenceof large deviation from the results obtained previously, exceptthat the linearity of the calibration curve was narrowed using iontrap techniques. 
 Interest in the analysis of monomolecular layers onsilicon has grown significantly with the development efforts forthin dielectrics in the semiconductor industry. The need nowexists to probe layers tens of nanometers in thickness reliably.Traditional FT-IR sampling techniques such as transmission or ATRtypically measure samples or coatings on samples where thethickness is 3 orders of magnitude greater. Grazing anglereflection techniques have been used successfully to measuremonomolecular layers on reflective substrates. However, in thecase where silicon is the substrate, resolving the distinctivefeatures of the surface film becomes difficult. As early as 1966,Harrick saw the need for the analysis of thin films on anothersubstrate by ATR and provided detailed theoretical description ofthe phenomenon. Harrick's publicationsfurther described equations for calculation of effective thicknessof very thin films on a base layer measured at parallel andperpendicular polarization. Later, Olsen andShimura proposed an ATR method for the analysis of thin layers onsilicon at 60 degrees using a germanium (Ge) crystal, and atheoretical absorbance amplification of 3 orders of magnituderelative to traditional measurements. Recently, Milosevic et al.further described a method of grazing angle single reflection ATRanalysis using 60-and 65-degree Ge crystals for organic monolayerson silicon. This publication described theoretical detail for theenhancement in sensitivity relative to traditional ATR sampling ofbulk materials and provided examples of spectral data for theanalysis of organic monolayers on silicon using this opticalconfiguration.
Efforts by theauthors to reproduce these measurements have been partiallysuccessful and this has led to the current effort to detail anoptimization of the configuration of a grazing angle ATR accessoryfor the FT-IR analysis of monomolecular layers on silicon.
 A new 4-channel analyzer (photoionization detector(PID), and three other sensors), model 102+, was introduced byPID analyzers last year. This analyzer has the capability oflogging 7 000 points for each channel. The data can be downloadedto a PC via the RS232 and the software that is provided.
 With a geographic position sensor (GPS) incorporated into thisanalyzer, the user could easily generate a concentration profileof the contaminants in the work area, and the data would beinvaluable. If, in addition, we interface a wireless mote to thisanalyzer, we have the ability to transmit the data directly to a PCfor database archiving and real-time monitoring.
Radiofrequency (RF) wireless “motes” arelow-power, inexpensive devices that support internal and externalsensors, processing, and communications in a small package. The“field mote” receives data from the model 102+then relays it back to an RF “base mote” connectedto a server with an MYSQL database. Multiple motes, each with aunique ID number, can be used in the system with one mote in eachanalyzer.
 The user can select from more than nearly 40 different sensorsand technologies such as PID, IR, TCD, CG, capacitance,temperature, and electrochemistry. This technology can be used todevelop concentration profiles before and after ventilation isadded, monitor areas where chemicals are being loaded or unloaded,monitor hoods because of the compact size, perform continuousmonitoring during process operations, and so forth. And with the on-board GPS,if the system is moved, the new location is automatically known.Additional applications and data will be discussed.
The clean air rule [1] has provided the legislation for the regulation andcontrol of mercury emissions from coal-fired utilities in NorthAmerica. To ensure the integrity of the systems designed tomeasure the mercury levels emitted, it is essential to developsuitable calibration sources which are traceable to nationalstandards, be it the National Institute of Standards and Technologyor other national standards bodies.
Since the introduction of its first mercury continuousemissions monitor, P S Analytical has provided a calibration source,the CAVKIT, which allows a set concentration of mercury to beintroduced at various stages in the sampling and measurementcycle. This has been successfully used to check calibration and totest the integrity of the full system. The system has beenevaluated by NIST [2]. Furtherdevelopments to provide a source of oxidized mercury and the experience of this in  the field will bedescribed.
 During the extraction of oil and gas, a largequantity of undesirable water and drilling waste is produced. Thechemical composition of discharged wasts is complex and may varyat different stages of oil and gas production. Drilling mudformulations have varied greatly over the years and are alsodependent on the rock formation to be drilled. Barite(BaSO4) is commonly used inwater-based drilling mud to control and regulate the hydrostaticpressure in the well. This material contains high levels of heavymetals such as mercury, arsenic, selenium, lead, cadmium, zinc,copper, chromium, and others. The cuttings of the drilling processare typically discharged to the environment giving cause forconcern about marine wildlife. The environmental effect of heavymetals from drilling discharges has created much debate. Bariteand associated trace minerals are of a nonsoluble form and aretherefore believed by many not to be biochemically available tomarine organisms.
 This paper will discuss the analytical methods that can beused for determinations of heavy metals from drilling mud,discharges, produced water, marine sediments, and water. The paperwill focus on the use of vapor generation atomic fluorescencespectrometry (AFS) as a method for determining mercury, arsenic,selenium, and antimony. This approach has been coupled to HPLCseparation techniques to provide speciation measurements. Afingerprinting method using the trace metals of barite will bepresented that potentially can be used to monitor the fate anddistribution of heavy metals from drilling discharges.
 On March 15, 2005, the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) issued the first-ever federal rule to permanently capand reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Inorder to comply with the EPA mercury emission standard, the powerindustry is required to determine the amount of mercury emittedfrom their power plants. For this purpose, one approach may utilizecontinuous emission monitors, which are designed for thecontinuous sampling of total mercury emissions in flue gasstreams. However, this approach is presently unproven and costly.Another method, referred to as EPA part 75 appendix K, allows forsampling of the stack effluent and offline analysis of sorbenttraps. Procedures proposed for the analysis of the sorbent trapsinclude extraction methods, draft EPA method 324 and draftmodified ASTM method 6414, a thermal desorption method with coldvapor atomic absorption (CVAAS), and thermal decompositionCVAAS.
 The sorbent trap analysis work described here utilizes thedirect combustion methodology based on ASTM method D 6722, totalmercury in coal, and coal combustion residues by direct combustionanalysis. The sample preparation and handling methodology weremodified so that the sorbent traps can be reliably and routinelyanalyzed. All analyses were obtained using a LECO AMA254 mercuryanalyzer. The resulting methodology has been shown to provideexcellent recoveries, often approaching 100%, as well asunprecedented accuracy and very precise mercury results.
 The proposed combustion methodology will be described indetail. This method will be compared and contrasted withalternative approaches. Round robin results will be presentedwhich utilize this direct combustion method on a set of preloadedsorbent tubes. Analyte recoveries, accuracy, and precision obtainedin this study will be provided and these results will be comparedto those obtained by competing methods.
Mercury has long been known to be a potent toxin but recently concern has increased significantly about chronic high-level exposure to Hg and other hazardous metals found in the environment leading to health safety concerns. Recognizing this hazardous mercury pollution, many environmental agencies have published advisories against this contamination and  issued stricter methods of analysis for mercury determination.
 Recently, a simple fluorescence technique of EPA method 245.7(mercury in water by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry)was developed to meet the increasing need for accurate, low-levelmercury and other trace environmental sensitive elements. Theadvantages of this technique include low noise, ultra lowerdetection limit (e.g., it can be as low as 0.001 ppb formercury), wider working range (103), and lowerinterference.
 Aurora Instruments Ltd. has introduced a new generation ofatomic fluorescence spectroscopy; AI 3300 offers a unique vaporgeneration with ppt detection limits for Hg and other hydrideforming elements. With dual channel simultaneous measurement, thesample can be digested in one batch and both elements (Hg plus oneof the other hydride forming elements) can be measuredsimultaneously. Moreover, the AI 3300 can be combined with theXYZ autosampler to give a flexible, fully automated operatingsystem, which significantly increases the productivity and reducesthe labor cost.
 Mercury determinations are required in a variety ofsample matrices and across a very wide range of concentrations.Sensitive techniques, such as purge and trap cold vapor atomicfluorescence spectroscopy, are available that can achievedetection limits at sub part-per-trillion sublevels but which cannothandle higher concentrations without massive dilutions. On theother hand, there are less sensitive techniques, such as directcombustion mercury generation that can handle diverse matriceswith little to no sample pretreatment.
 Instrumentation designed for the differing techniques sharesmuch in terms of their detection systems but little in terms ofsample introduction. In all cases, free gaseous mercury is thespecies that is ultimately quantified. The processes to producethe mercury gas, however, diverge significantly. Methods 1631,245.1 and 245.7 employ chemical reactions with acids, oxidants,and reductants. Method 7473 employs sample heating followed byvapor catalysis.
We will introduce a combustion-based instrument to determine mercury in matrices such as solids, tissues, coal, and soils without sample pretreatment that can be equipped with a high-sensitivity liquid introduction system.
 US EPA anticipates increased implementation ofmethod 7473 for the determination of mercury in a variety ofsample matrices. The method provides rapid analysis with little tono sample pretreatment. In most cases, results can be obtained inless than ten minutes. Moreover, available instrumentation forthis technique is remarkably stable and immune from matrixinterferences. As a result, a variety of samples can be analyzedfor mercury from a single stored calibration curve.
 In this presentation, we will investigate the impact of systemcharacteristics such as moisture control, gas selection, anddecomposition temperature on accuracy, sensitivity, and stability.Using aqueous calibration standards mercury concentrations will bereported for a variety of certified reference materials. 
 In moving an analysis from the laboratory to theprocess line, the spectroscopy stays the same but just abouteverything else changes. In particular, the analyst is no longerin control; the requirements of the production process almostalways take precedence.
 We designate at-line as close to but not connected to aprocess, online as connected with a slip stream, and inline as aninstallation inserted directly. Except in the at-line case, samplemodification is usually impractical; the sample must be dealt withas it is and even then sample handling must usually be keptsimple.
 The process may impose sampling restrictions that make one orthe other spectral region the obvious choice. In other cases,either spectroscopy might be acceptable. The choice then willdepend on other aspects of the analysis situation such as the following.
Is this a standard analysis available as a complete solution?What is the operator's  skill level? What mechanical packaging is required?Is data communication necessary?Will there be adequate service support?Price.
Is this a standard analysis available as a complete solution?
What is the operator's  skill level?
 What mechanical packaging is required?

Price.
In other cases, spectroscopic variables may dictate the choiceof spectral region. Some are as follows:
(1) The convenient or required pathlength is
long: use nonfundamental (weak) absorptions,short: use fundamental (strong) absorptions.
long: use nonfundamental (weak) absorptions,
short: use fundamental (strong) absorptions.
(2) Concentration of the component to be measured is
trace: use fundamentals,major: use nonfundamentals or very short path (e.g., ATR).
trace: use fundamentals,
major: use nonfundamentals or very short path (e.g., ATR).
The sample stream is chemically aggressive; optical materialsthat are suitable for use at longer wavelengths may be vulnerableto be attacked by aggressive chemicals. At wavelengths shorter than5 μm (2000 cm−1), quartz,sapphire, and cubic zirconia are almost universally applicable.
The sample stream temperature varies; combination bands thatinvolve very low frequency absorptions may be very temperaturedependent. ATR measurements may be temperature-dependent due torefractive index changes. The amount of conditioning orcompensation required will depend on the strength of thetemperature dependence.
 The sample stream pressure varies; pressure broadening ingases can cause changes in apparent absorption that are differentfor different bands. Hydraulic hammers in liquid streams can causedeflection of optical components. Pressure conditioningrequirements will vary on a case-by-case basis but may be lesssevere if the wavelength region is carefully chosen.
The FDA has defined a set of goals for thepharmaceutical industry, called the Process Analytical Technologyinitiative (PAT). This initiative is intended to address theincreasing pressure it is being subjected to which from Congress and thepublic to reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals preparations.Instrumental methods of analysis such as NIR play a key role inaddressing the new paradigm the FDA is promoting. Making thoseanalytical methods conform to the strict requirements of aregulated environment, however, leads the spectroscopic communityinto new territory and ways of doing things.
The success of modern NIR spectroscopy has depended, from thebeginning, on the confluence of three distinct concepts: theextremely good precision and stability of modern instrumentation,the use of diffuse reflectance measurements to collect thespectral data, and the application of sophisticated multivariatemethods to extract the useful information from the data. Theadvent of the new PAT initiative from the FDA has increased theneed for new and innovative approaches to extractinginformation and simultaneously imposed new requirements on them.In this talk, we will examine the historical bases for analysis ofNIR data, a new paradigm that has appeared, and theexpectations for advancing into the future.
 Image analysis (IA) is used in forensic science forcomparative analysis between a known sample (control) and anunknown sample. The FDA's Forensic Chemsitry Center (FCC)uses IA in cases related to counterfeit pharmaceuticals andillicit drugs. The purpose of this presentation is to describe acomputerized IA method for comparing alpha-numeric printingencountered in evidence related to cases of counterfeitpharmaceuticals and illicit drugs. Because of the adaptivefeatures of the human eye, the manual, real-time image analysismethod is less sensitive to variations of shades of color anddetail. The computerized image analysis method described in thispresentation does not suffer from this subjectivity and thereforeis better at determining subtle differences between samples. Toachieve consistent results, the lighting procedure, the imageacquisition, and the image analysis method were optimized. Tominimize variations due to lighting, a lighting diffuser was used.To evaluate the computerized IA method and to assess the detailsrevealed in an image comparison, computerized analysis of imageswas compared with manual image analysis at two differentmagnifications. Using digital scanner camera, low-magnification imagescould be sampled at high resolution, thus making it possible toanalyze larger printing areas. This presentation will describe thecomputerized IA method, compared to the manual method, and actualcase studies using the computerized IA method.
 The monitoring of production processes usesphysical parameters such as temperature, and pressure but chemicalparameters are also used for process control and optimization. Toachieve constant product quality, analytical measurements areindispensable. Reliable monitoring requires content determinationof components, auxiliary substances, or reaction products. At thesame time, these determinations are used for process documentationand validation. The measuring systems applied in practice dependon the integration in the process and the position of the system;we find inline, online, at-line, or offline analysis systems,each of which has its advantages and justifications. Inlinemeasurements are direct continuous measurements (e.g., pH value orconductivity), and online measurements are carried out in a bypass athigh frequency, while offline measurements in the laboratoryoffer maximum flexibility. At-line systems are less well knownalthough they offer numerous advantages. They are positioneddirectly at the production line and allow rapid and reproducibleanalyses of important process-related parameters. If the taskconsists in measuring different parameters in samples fromdifferent sampling sites, at-line measurements are more economicalthan online measurements and just as flexible and reproducible aslaboratory offline analyses.
 This presentation gives a detailed description and discussionof a commercially available at-line system. Thanks to its robustdesign, the system is suitable for the severe conditionsprevailing in production plants and continuously suppliesanalytical results. External information can be fed into thesystem via the integrated I/O components and internally be usedfor parameter or measurement control. The integrated I/Ocomponents also serve to output analytical results and signals tothe process control system and link the at-line system to theprocess environment. The control software includes exporting ofthe results to a LIMS or to external servers and offers additionalfunctions such as remote control.
 The wide scope of application of the described ProcessLabat-line system is discussed and practical applications fromvarious industries are presented. The applications include etchingbaths from the steel industry, electroplating baths from theplating industry, and phosphatizing baths from the automotive industryplus examples from the food, paper, and pulp industries.
 The presentation describes the development andcharacterization of analytical properties of quantum dot-basedprobes for enzymatic activity and for screening enzyme inhibitors.The luminescent probes are based on fluorescence resonance energytransfer (FRET) between luminescent quantum dots that serve asdonors and molecular acceptors that are immobilized to the surfaceof the quantum dots through peptide linkers. Peptide-coatedCdSe/ZnS quantum dots were prepared using a one-step ligandexchange process in which RGDC peptide molecules replacetrioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) molecules as the capping ligands ofthe quantum dots. The peptide-coated quantum dots were labeledwith rhodamine to form the FRET probes. The emission quantum yieldof the quantum dot FRET probes was fourfold lower than the emissionquantum yield of TOPO-capped quantum dots. However, the quantumdot FRET probes were sufficiently bright to carry out quantitativeenzymatic assays. The probes were used first to test the enzymaticactivity of trypsin in solution based on signal changes of thequantum dot FRET probes in the presence of proteolytic enzymes.For example, exposure of the quantum dot FRET probes to500 μg/mL trypsin for 15 minutes resulted in60% increase in the photoluminescence of quantum dots anda corresponding decrease in the emission of the rhodaminemolecules when detached from the surface of the quantum dots dueto enzymatic cleavage of the peptide molecules. The quantum dotFRET-based probes were used to monitor the enzymatic activity oftrypsin and to screen trypsin inhibitors for their inhibition typeand efficiency.
 The haloacetic acids (HAAs) are a class ofdisinfection by-products (DBPs) formed during the chlorination ofdrinking water. Currently, the USEPA regulates five HAA species:monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid,monobromoacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid. The five HAA speciesare called HAA5, and due to possible health concerns, the USEPA hasset a maximum contaminant level for HAA5 at 0.060 mg/L.Additionally, there are four unregulated HAA species commonlypresent in drinking water: bromochloroacetic acid,bromodichloroacetic acid, dibromochloroacetic acid, andtribromoacetic acid. These four unregulated species and the HAA5species are called HAA9. 
 There are currently two methods approved by the USEPA for thedetermination of HAA9 in drinking water. The most recent method isUSEPA 552.3, which is an update to USEPA 552.2. USEPA 552.3 usesliquid-liquid microextraction, followed by derivatization of theHAAs to their corresponding methyl esters and analysis by GC-ECD.USEPA 552.3 works very well for compliance monitoring (sampling ona quarterly basis) with superb method detection limit, accuracy,and precision values; however, when adapted to online monitoring,it becomes cumbersome at hourly sampling rates.
 In this research, two analyzers and methods were developed forthe purpose of online monitoring of HAA9 concentrations indrinking water distribution systems. The first analyzer iscapillary membrane sampling-flow injection analysis (CMS-FIA)using the fluorescent reaction of nicotinamide with the HAAs(NCA-FL), and the second is postcolumn reaction-ionchromatography (PCR-IC) using NCA-FL. The CMS-FIA uses a siliconerubber membrane within a Tefzel shell to separate the HAAs fromthe trihalomethanes (THMs), followed by reaction with NCA in basicsolution and fluorescence detection of the NCA-HAA products. TheCMS-FIA is able to analyze for total HAAs and total THMs, but it isnot able to speciate within each class. The PCR-IC analyzer isable to speciate the HAAs in time using IC followed by postcolumnreaction with NCA to form the fluorescent NCA-HAA products. Methoddetection limit, accuracy, and precision studies, as well as twoside-by-side online monitoring studies, will be presented for bothanalyzers. The monitoring studies were carried out in Memphis, TN,and Houston, TX, which directly compared CMS-FIA and PCR-IC to EPA552.3.
 In the United States, chlorination is the primarydrinking water disinfection process and is quite successful atpreventing waterborne disease; however, it leads to the formationof disinfection by-products (DBPs). Since DBPs like thetrihalomethanes (THM4) have possible health issues, they are amajor concern for all utilities. The THM4 include chloroform,bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform.Presently, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) set by the USEPAfor the sum total of THM4 is 0.080 mg/L. To conductcompliance monitoring, the USEPA has approved four gaschromatography- (GC-) based methods: 502.2, 524.2, 551, and 551.1.Even though they are very reliable with excellent method detectionlimit (MDL), accuracy, and precision values, they are onlyintended for quarterly or yearly sampling ratherthan hourly online monitoring. The development ofautomated, inexpensive analyzers/methods that can perform onlinemonitoring of THM4 has gained interest due to the possibility ofnew rules and regulations requiring lower MCLs or better treatmentstrategies.
 Three methods were developed: capillary membrane sampling-gaschromatography (CMS-GC), capillary membrane sampling-flowinjection analysis (CMS-FIA), and online purge and trap gaschromatography (OPTGC). CMS-GC and CMS-FIA both take advantage ofthe CMS device, which uses silicone membrane tubing inside Tefzeltubing for extraction of THM4. OPTGC uses a gas extraction cell(GEC) that also contains silicone membrane tubing inline with anabsorbent trap to sample then concentrate THM4. CMS-FIA cannotspeciate THM4 as with CMS-GC and OPTGC, but can provide resultsfor both total THM4 and total haloacetic acids (HAAs). CMS-FIAuses a fluorescence detector to detect the products from thereaction between THM4/HAAs and nicotinamide (NCA) reagents in basicsolution. OPTGC uses a dry electrolytic conductivity detector(DELCD) and CMS-GC uses an electron capture detector (ECD) todetect THM4. It should be noted that none of the developed methodsare designed to conduct compliance monitoring or meant to replacethe USEPA methods.
 An overview of experimental details for these onlinemonitoring analyzers/methods as well as a comparison of theadvantages and disadvantages of each will be presented. Theresults from method detection limit (MDL), accuracy, precision,and two online monitoring studies conducted in Memphis, TN, andHouston, TX, drinking water distribution systems will also bepresented.
 To an aerobic biotreatment system, changes includingcomposition and concentration in influent can cause serious plantupsets due to inhibition effects. Quick monitoring and predictionof the impact of such changes are needed. This is especiallycritical to industrial wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)operations where the influent varies constantly and the operationis near capacity. Since the respiration rate is a direct indicatorof activated sludge activity, respirometry can be an effectivetool to monitor the WWTP performance. Currently, both online andbench respirometers have been used by many wastewater treatmentfacilities. However, due to its complexity, turnaround time, andresource demands, respirometry is not as widely used as otheranalytical methods, for example, TOC and COD. In this paper, wedescribe the use of a bench respirometer for quickly monitoringthe influent inhibition to a WWTP. In the test, respiration rateswere measured at different concentrations of wastewater. Bycomparing rates with the respiration of a control sample ofactivated sludge, the inhibition or toxicity as EC50 can be easilydetermined. The test usually takes less than one hour. This methodwas applied to map the influent ratio for multiple waste streamsentering the treatment plant. It was also extended to assist aquick assessment of the toxicity of a single organic compound anda potentially new waste stream influent to the WWTP. 
 Hydrothermal vents along oceanic ridges were notdiscovered until the late 1970s, so much of their chemistry hasyet to be elucidated. These black smokers reach temperatures of upto 400°C and release a plethora of chemicalsinto their surrounding environment, especially sulfides. Studyingthese vents is of consequence because several different organismsutilize chemosynthesis as opposed to photosynthesis as they thriveoff of  the sulfides released. Raman spectroscopy is ideal tomonitor different ions because of its ability to detect manycompounds simultaneously, as well as the weak signal from water.In the present study, black smoker vents on the Juan de Fuca ridgein the Pacific Northwest were investigated using Ramanspectroscopy. Signal enhancement was achieved through the use ofsilver nanoparticles.
 Chiral compounds are increasing in interest due totheir binding specificity, enabling directed targeting for druginteraction. It is the challenge of the organic and analyticalchemist to facilitate their synthesis, purification, analysis.
 The pharmaceutical standards placed on drug candidates requirethat these chiral compounds be fully resolved for characterizationand the successful purification of the enantiomers also requires abaseline resolution factor. Analysis of chiral compounds can betime-consuming based on their limited resolution, Rs factor. Thereare several chiral columns which are targeted to the specificsigma and pi interactions of a chiral compound; however manycompounds share many features related to the separationcharacteristics of multiple columns. The problem is usually that onlyone of these features is key to the resolution of the enantiomers,so the compound is generally run on several closely relatedcolumns to achieve the desired resolution of theseenantiomers.
 An application to address this time-consuming factor has beenaccomplished with the use of a custom configured HPLC system. Thesystem is loaded with the samples of interest and each sample isautomatically injected into a single port with a quaternaryinjection system that fills four simultaneous injection loopsanalytically. The sample is analyzed using a custom gradientprofile and the software automatically generates and/or emailseach sample's analysis by the four columns. This procedurerepresents a fourfold increase in productivity and is expandableto eight simultaneous analyses.
Many analytical laboratories use GCs for routine applications involving large numbers of samples. In such instances, sample throughput becomes an important operational aspect.
In this paper, we investigate various technologies for reducing the overall analysis time by shortening the time used for the chromatography and reducing the “wasted” time in between chromatograms spent in cooling and equilibrating the oven and in preparing an autosampler to be ready for the next sample injection.
 Examples are shown where the chromatography time is reduced byusing high oven temperature programming rates in conjunction withshort, narrow-bore, thin-film capillary columns using hydrogen ascarrier gas. There are, however, tradeoffs to this approach andalternatives such as isothermal chromatography, columnbackflushing, and heart cutting are shown and discussed.
 In many instances, however, the user will have an establishedmethod and will not wish to develop new conditions to acceleratethe chromatography. In such instances, the time the system spendsin coming ready for the next run becomes critical. A radical newGC air-bath oven has been developed to cool from450°C to 50°C in less than 2minutes. This is able to reduce the oven cooling time by severalminutes over more conventionally designed ovens. This timereduction is further improved by the preemptive rinsing of theliquid autosampler syringe with the next sample prior to the GCbecoming ready. In this way, significant time-savings are seenwith no changes to existing analytical methods.
 Figure 3 shows achromatogram of diesel fuel run at fast temperature programmedrates with the fast cooling and the preemptive autosampler syringerinse giving an overall cycle time of less than 7.5 minutes eventhough the column is being programmed from 50°Cto 320°C, and prerun system checks such asautomatic carrier gas leak testing and flame ionization detectorflameout testing are applied.
 Despite the advancements in availableinstrumentation, automated delivery equipment, and data analysissoftware, the rate at which high-throughput laboratories canprocess samples is still limited by the complexity of the matrix.Fast gas chromatography (GC) with a variety of selective detectorshas found wide application as a rapid screening technique forenvironmental samples, though most current applications illustratethe excellent separation efficiencies that can be achieved for theanalysis of a small number of compounds. The analysis of complexmixtures has generally been avoided since the ability to providepositive target compound identification is compromised bycoeluting target compounds and increased matrix background noiseunder fast acquisition conditions. In this study, fast temperatureprograming conditions and spectral deconvolution software wereemployed to develop a GC/MS method for the quantitative analysisof 105 widely different volatile and semivolatile organics. Theresulting 16-minute method was used to analyze fortified soilsamples in the absence of a sample cleanup procedure, and theresults were compared with those obtained by traditionalEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods SW-846 8270 and 8260analyses conducted by an independent contract laboratory. Theresults showed that while the standard EPA analyses failed toidentify nine of the target compounds, the 16-minute GC/MS methodwith mass spectral deconvolution identified all 105 target,surrogate, and internal standard compounds with measurementaccuracy well within the acceptable recovery ranges of the EPAmethod. It was therefore possible to increase the productivity oflaboratories conducting environmental analyses by combining thesetwo EPA methods into a single abbreviated GC/MS method using massspectral deconvolution software. Productivity can be furtherincreased as the use of spectral deconvolution also eliminates theneed for time-consuming sample cleanup.
 This method utilized reversed-phasehigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrosprayionization tandem mass spectrometric (ESI-MS/MS) detection. Samplepreparation was accomplished with an automated 96-well proteinprecipitation procedure. The HPLC separation was carried out onYMC HPLC column (ODS-AQ S-5, 120 Å, 2.0 ×150 mm) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min with a runtime of approximately 5 minutes. ABT-279 was eluted using amobile phase of 20 mMNH4OAc in 20/80 (v/v)acetonitrile/water. A deuterated ABT-279, A-804693 D3, was used asan internal standard to account for the difference due toextraction recovery, ion suppression, matrix effects, andinstrumental performance. Mass spectrometry detection was achievedusing a PE Sciex API 3000 with triple quadrupole mass spectrometerequipped with a turbo ionspray as LC/MS interface. ESI massspectra were acquired in a positive ion mode with multiplereaction monitoring. Data were acquired and processed with analyst1.3.2.
 Since semiautomated sample preparation was employed with ashort run time, 60 samples could be prepared in one 96-well plateand 120 samples could be analyzed per day per system. Nointerference was observed from matrix across the elution windowsof 2.2 to 4.15 minutes, which indicates the specificity of themethod. Acceptable assay precision (Đ 1.7% CV) andaccuracy (bias between −8.4% and 2.1%)were obtained over a linear range of 21 to 21000 ng/mL.The mean correlation coefficient was 0.9980 ± 0.0003. Theextraction recovery ranged from 46% to 52%. Sincedeuterated analog was used as an internal standard, no ionsuppression was observed. The plasma samples went through 5freeze/thaw cycles with no degradation.
 This high-throughput method was robust, sensitive, specific,and accurate. This method has been successfully used to quantifyABT-279 in mouse plasma to support in vivo mouse micronucleusassays. 
 Micro total analytical systems (μTASs),mainly based on microreactor technology, have caught greatattention in various analytical areas such as DNA analysis anddrug discovery. Less commonly, μTASs are used to exploreproperties of chemical reactions. The microreactor confers manyadvantages over conventional scale chemistry, includingenhancement in heat and mass transfer, high surface-to-volumeratio, easy control of concentration gradients,and the possibility of eliminating unwanted side reactions. Otherbenefits also include safety and reduced exposure to toxic andhazardous materials. To date, the majority of microreactor systemsare built up on a chip platform. These are effective for rapidreactions. Essentially, a single bolus of reactants is passedthrough the system and conversion to product is measured online.For slower reactions, this is impractical.
 We have devised a parallel approach in which many boluses ofreactants are injected serially into a capillary-basedmicroreactor. The reactions, which may take hours, occur inparallel. Analysis is by online rapid GC or HPLC. The use ofcapillaries also eliminates the complicated fabrication process,reactors are easy to make, and temperature is easy to control.
 Optimization of the reactors has been accomplished to yieldthe maximum number of reactions per unit time. The dimensions ofthe microreactor including internal diameter, length, and theresidence time of solvent have been extensively studied. Amathematical model has been established based on Taylor dispersiontheory. The maximum throughput of the reactor is in the range of 5-to 6-hour reactions per hour. Our experimental system is theL-proline catalyzed aldol reaction of acetone and benzaldehyde.
 Real-time screening of DNA aptamer-humanImmunoglobulin E (IgE) interactions by surface plasmon resonanceimaging (SPRi) is described. A multichannel PDMS flow cell wasimplemented, making it possible to perform affinity screening ofbiological interactions on one chip in a single run.Thiol-terminated aptamers were self-assembled in defined PDMSchannels on a gold substrate. Cysteamine was codeposited with thethiol aptamers to maintain the aptamer binding efficiencies. Fouraptamers with different nucleic acid sequences were tested fortheir interaction strength toward IgE and the result confirmedthat aptamer-I  (5′-SH-GGG GCA CGT TTA TCC GTCCCT CCT AGT GGC GTG CCC C-3′) has the strongestbinding affinity. Both positive and negative control experimentswere conducted, showing a selective binding of the aptamer-I tothe IgE molecules. A linear relationship between IgE and aptamer-Iwas obtained, and a 2 nM detection limit was achieved.Global fitting of the SPRi sensorgrams was successfully performed,and the dissociation constant of the aptamer I-IgE complex wasdetermined to be 273.6 † 0.8 nM, which agrees wellwith the reported values in the literature. The aptamer affinityscreening by SPR imaging demonstrates significant advantages overcompeting methods because of the nonlabeling, real-time, andpotentially high-throughput features. The capability of providingboth qualitative and quantitative results on a multichannel chipshows that SPRi is a powerful tool for the study of biologicalinteractions in a multiplexed format.
 Laboratory Informatics has long promised to revolutionize theanalytical laboratory, yet most laboratories today arecharacterized by isolated ships of automation captained byindividual analysts navigating a sea of paper. Even the mostautomated techniques are reduced to printing paper reports forreview and approval by analysts and supervision. The latest toolswhich are being touted to correct this problem and to achieve thepaperless laboratory are electronic laboratory notebooks(ELNs).
 This paper will address the role of electronic laboratorynotebooks in the modern laboratory relative to establishedinformatics solutions like LIMS, as well as defining anarchitecture and decision tree for determining what solutions arebest for their organization. Some of the factors to considerinclude
existing IT infrastructure;existing informatics solutions (LIMS, chromatography data systems, data repositories, document management solutions);type of laboratory (R&D, quality);end-user capabilities;company and customer culture;regulatory constraints.

 It is a mistake to assume that one size fits all or that asingle informatics solution will meet all needs. Case studies willbe discussed.
 Mapping and analysis of workflows and definition ofbusiness requirements have long been recognized as absoluteprerequisites for successful implementation of informatics systemsin the labs. With the increased emphasis on the implementation andintegration of new informatics tools like electronic lab notebooks(ELNs) and scientific data management systems (SDMSs) which areintimately intertwined with laboratory business processes,traditional process mapping approaches are no longer adequate.
 There are now many options to consider and choices to be madeon how to split up the scope of requirements between the new andentrenched systems. But which process is easier and more efficientfor the lab analysts? Which is more secure? Which one is more costeffective? Add to this the fact that most organizations are nowrequiring hard process improvement metrics before approvingbudgets for these new informatics programs and it becomes obviousthat the traditional approaches to static process mapping areinadequate in supporting these decisions. Instead, a tool likedynamic process modeling and simulation is required to model thecomplex interactions between process and new technology optionsand to provide budget approvers of the hard metrics about which they need to makefunding decisions.
 In this presentation, we will provide some background on whatis involved in using a tool like process simulation for labs, someof its distinct advantages over conventional static modelingapproaches, and we will present a lab informatics case study toshow how modeling and simulation can provide meaningful benefitsto lab informatics programs.
A rapidly growing number of corporations are moving their information structure toward a more centralized enterprise-wide model where all the key information about their business can be readily accessed with a few key strokes from anywhere in the world. From the purchase of raw materials through the delivery of the finished product, the availability of the data, facts, and figures is key to being able to compete in the fast-paced marketplace of today's business environment. The chemical industry is no exception.
Many of today's most competitive businesses have incorporated this type of centralized, enterprise-wide, multi-faceted information systems to handle all aspects of their business. One such system is SAP.
 While the implementation of SAP can encompass all aspects of abusiness, the topic discussed here will be the implementation ofthe quality module of SAP into a quality assurance/controllaboratory environment which already had 20 years of LIMS use andexperience.
 SAP and other enterprise-wide software systems, by their verynature, require a highly structured series of data entry steps ina rigid workflow in order to perform smoothly. Adapting such arigid workflow was difficult in an existing, mature chemicalbusiness which (1) makes bulk chemicals for inventory (no customeridentified initially) or (2) responds to customer requests whichat times only provide 48-hour lead time. The case study presentedhere will describe one lab solution to these manufacturingscenarios incorporating the use of SAP for finished product datastorage and reporting as a part of enterprise-wide strategy, andthe continuing use of an existing LIMS for “in-process” testing.
 Neuropeptides are a class of complex peptidehormones that are known to influence many essential physiologicalprocesses. As an ongoing effort to characterize these signalingmolecules, we identify the neuropeptide complements of brain,thoracic ganglion, the sinus gland, and the pericardial organ fromthe lobster Homarus americanus. Several MS-based analyticalmethods have been employed, with improvement on small-scale samplepreparation, such as direct tissue analysis and on-targetdigestion. To improve detection of higher mass peptides, diluteDHB was examined as matrix and a low amplitude SORI-CID burst wasused to clean up matrix adduct. These improvements, coupled withthe high mass resolution and accuracy of FTMS, enabled a completeprofiling of a wide mass range of neuropeptides covering m/z500–9000 in the tissue samples of the lobster H.americanus. Such peptidomic analysis was further enhanced by thede novo sequencing capability offered by LC-ESI-QTOF. 
 To study neuropeptides' functions, we also examinepeptide hormones in circulating hemolymph, which is quitechallenging due to low peptide concentration, interference fromhigh salt concentrations, and abundant large proteins. To preparethe hemolymph sample, acidified methanol and ammonium citratebuffer was added to extract peptides and precipitate proteinsfollowed by the use of a 10 K MWCO filtering membrane toremove big proteins. As a result, we identified several peptidehormones in the hemolymph samples. Furthermore, we investigate theeffects of temperature acclimation on the hemolymph peptideprofile change. Using green shore crab Carcinus maenas and lobsterH. americanus as model systems, we explore the neuropeptidomechanges in response to environmental stress such as salinitychange and temperature variation. Both direct tissue samples andcirculating fluids are evaluated and compared to identifypotential neuropeptide players involved in regulating thesephysiological processes.
 In the brain, glia are present at higher numbers than neurons,and yet have been much less studied. In the past decade, severalstudies have examined both the structure and function ofastrocytes, a subtype of glia. Astrocytes express membrane ionicchannels, transmitters, and receptors related to importantsignaling pathways in the brain. These discoveries have attractedscientific interest in the important role of astrocytes incell-to-cell communication. The identification ofneuropeptide-like molecules in astrocytes provides an additionalmeans for such a communication between astrocytes and neurons. Inthis work, capillary liquid chromatography coupled offline withmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight massspectrometry (CapLC-MALDI-TOF-MS) and TOF/TOF-MS have been used toidentify peptides in astrocyte type-I cell lines from mousecerebellum. These samples were extracted, and the extract wasseparated on a 3 μm diameter reversed-phase columnat 2.5 μL/min. The separated fractions weredeposited onto each sample spot on the MALDI target for massspectrometric analysis. CapLC-MALDI-TOF-MS analysis detectedmultiple peptides, and the subsequent TOF/TOF-MS and peptidesequence analysis allow their identification. Currently,additional peptides are being characterized. Next, putativefunctions will be evaluated based on similarities to knowncell-to-cell signaling molecules. The preliminary results areconsistent with the involvement of peptides from glia in cell-cellcommunication in the brain.

 One way to study brain function is to correlatechanges in neurotransmitter levels with behavior andpharmacological manipulation. In such measurements, temporalresolution is important in achieving good correlations becauseneurochemical concentrations fluctuate rapidly. In previous work,we have coupled microdialysis online to capillary electrophoresisand demonstrated that this method can measure changes in severalamino acid neurotransmitters every 13 seconds, realizing a60-fold improvement in temporal resolution over typical HPLCmeasurements of dialysate. As previously demonstrated, thisimprovement is made possible by the high mass sensitivity andautomation of CE. In this work, we use this novel instrument tostudy the rapid effects of estradiol on neurotransmitter release.In the first experiment, we measure the effect of estradiol ongamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release. We have found thatestradiol decreases GABA release and this release is furtherreduced through overexpression of the alpha estrogen receptor.This result supports the hypothesis that estrogen enhancesdopamine function through the alpha estrogen receptor, thereforereinforcing addictive substances such as cocaine by inhibitingGABA release, which in turn disinhibits dopamine release. We arepresently evaluating whether estradiol exerts this effect througha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We arecurrently applying this mechanistic data to a behavioral model. Ina second experiment, we are investigating whether a genderdifference exists in glutamate and GABA releases after cocainesensitization. A greater behavioral response is observed insensitized females compared to males upon cocaine challenge. Weare investigating whether an enhancement in GABA and/or glutamateis correlated to this enhancement in behavior and how hormonesaffect this release. These experiments will help elucidate sexdifferences in brain function in pathways important inaddiction.
 Recent research on brain metabolism has taken aserious interest in lactate as a substrate for energy metabolism[1]. We have previouslyestablished an experimental model in the rat cerebellum that hasallowed us to examine interplay between neuronal spikingactivity, synaptic activity, cerebral blood flow [2]. In order to extend this model toinclude online neurochemical monitoring we have developed ahigh-sensitivity version of our rapid sampling assay for onlinemicrodialysis [3]. Thisbioelectrochemical assay can now detect 2 micromolar concentrationchanges at 10-second sampling intervals. With this assay, we nowmonitor glucose, lactate changes in response to electricalstimulation in cerebellar region.
 Short periods of electrical stimulation (2, 5, and10 Hz for 30 seconds) were found to produce no discernablechanges in glucose or lactate levels (despite increases in bloodflow). Prolonged stimulation (5 Hz for 20 minutes)however yielded transient increases in lactate levels of20–50 μM. On cessation of the stimulus,lactate levels recovered transiently. Glucose levels remainedunaffected throughout. With topical application of CNQX (ampareceptor blocker), the lactate responses to electrical stimulationdisappeared and were shown to reappear with subsequent washout ofthe drug. With topical application of DAB (glycogen breakdowninhibitor), the lactate responses remained unchanged; however,blood glucose levels were shown to fall in response to thestimulations. These results will be discussed in terms of the rolelactate plays as a metabolic neuronal substrate.
Tetrahymena thermophila is a ciliated,unicellular protist that is often used as a model organism inbiology labs due to its ability to reproduce quickly and itsnontoxic and robust nature. Interestingly, it has the ability toundergo asexual and sexual reproduction via a conjugationjunction. The goal of this project was to identify as manyproteins within the conjugation junction as possible. Usingvarious isolation techniques, proteins were extracted from theconjugation junction of T. thermophila and thenunderwent SDS-PAGE followed by enzymatic digestion using trypsin.The tryptic peptides were injected into an HPLC equipped with amicro-bore C18 column, and then analyzed using an electrosprayionization (ESI) ion-trap mass spectrometer. ESI generated anassortment of multiply charged ions. Analysis of the spectraallowed for the identification of potential tryptic peptide ions,which were isolated and fragmented via tandem mass spectrometry.The resulting fragment ions were then screened against a T. thermophila database containing theoretical proteinsbased on its genome. Using the database, the identities andprobable functions of the proteins could be determined. Proteinsidentified by the database were individually compared to theempirical data to validate that the results matched. So far, thisproject has led to the identification of 31 distinct proteinsisolated from the T. thermophila conjugationjunction.

This work focuses on developing a rapid and reliable method to test for antioxidants using capillary electrophoresis. Antioxidants are important in preventing free radical damage to cellular components including DNA. Common antioxidants include ascorbic acid, catechins, and phenolic acids which are found in a variety of food samples and dietary supplements. Due to the difficulty in isolating and quantifying all the individual antioxidant components of a sample, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) has become an important measurement. TAC takes into account all the antioxidants in a sample as well as their relative oxidation capability. Current methods to measure TAC, including FRAP and ABTS, are both lengthy and labor intensive. Capillary electrophoresis provides automation, fast analysis, as well as minimal sample and waste volumes. This method relies on two sequential redox reactions occurring within the confines of the CE capillary. The first reaction involves the complete oxidation of the antioxidant(s) in the sample with an excess of N-bromosuccinimide. The remaining N-bromosuccinimide then reacts with a plug of excess ascorbic acid. The ascorbic acid that remains is detected using absorbance at 265 nm. The characterization and validation of this method, as well as its application to measure the TAC of a real sample, will be presented.
 Increased demand for soil testing and plantanalysis is driven by nutrient management regulation andassociated requirements for environmental monitoring and farmerawareness of benefits from regular use of soil/plant analysis.Regular soil testing and plant analysis eliminate expenditures onunnecessary fertilizers and prevent excessive rates and losses ofrequired plant nutrients to surface and groundwater.Concentrations of nutrients, such as total N and NO3-N,and total P and extractable P, and cations such asaluminum, magnesium, manganese, and potassium are used to evaluateplant health, soil and water quality, and management of croppingsystems. Manual colorimetric methods are used for analysis ofnutrient concentrations in plant, soil, and water samples. Timerequirements and poor reproducibility of manual methods make itdifficult to achieve goals for high precision and high throughputof samples during plant, soil, and water analysis. Interference ofextracted sample matrix makes the analyses harder to gethigh-accuracy and low-interference data.
 This presentation will demonstrate high-accuracy data byelimination of matrix interference using advanced diode arrayspectrophotometer in a discrete analyzer (model DA3500) andcompare high-precision results with data generated with continuousflow analyzer (Model FS3100) available from OI Analytical, CollegeStation. Analyses of nutrients, such as N, P, and cations insoil/plant sample, will be reported and evaluated from interferencestudies. The specific enhanced data quality and productivitybenefits to soil/plant analysis will be presented. Advantages ofnew discrete technology and continuous flow technologies will behighlighted.
 Thermal power plants consume very large amounts ofwater. Water works as the heat transfer medium and its expandingvapor drives the turbines to produce electricity. In order toprevent corrosion, the water has to be maintained at a pH above 7.In general, this is achieved by the addition of Lewis bases suchas ammonia and ethanolamine. Besides the added chemicals, alsocorrosive compounds such as sodium, sulfate, and chloride canenter the water system of power plants. The presence of these ionsindicates intrusions of external cooling water or contaminationproblems due to condenser tube leaks. 
 An efficient water chemistry monitoring program controls boththe added and the detrimental ions, thus preventing failures andextending the operating lifetimes of components in contact withwater. Ion chromatography is the method of choice to meet theanalytical challenge. However, the large concentration differencesbetween the added bases and the alkali metal ions often complicatequantification and require time-consuming sample preparationsteps. Whereas sample preparation steps used to be carried outbefore the sample entered the IC system, these steps have now beenautomated and included between the sample changer and the IC. Apreconcentration column acts as the interface between the ICsystem and inline sample preparation. All sample preparation isautomated and controlled by the instrument software. The cationsto be analyzed enter the IC system via the preconcentrationcolumn. This arrangement is very robust, easy to configure, andhighly suitable for accurately determining trace levels (ppt) oflithium and sodium in the presence of ppm quantities ofethanolamine (Figure 4).The relative standard deviations are better than 1.5%.Carryover for metal cations is below 0.3%; recovery ratesare better than 98.5%.

 An adaptation of an HPLC-based method developed byLazzarino et al. (Analytical Biochemistry, 322 (2003)51–59) was used for the determination of reduced andoxidized ascorbic acid, reduced and oxidized glutathione, oxidizednicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), reduced NADH, oxidizednicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), and reducedNADPH. Sample preparation involved a series of three extractions,using acetonitrile, a 10 mM solution of potassium phosphate(pH 7.4), and chloroform. Samples were ground with glass beadsprior to extraction. All samples were filtered before they areanalyzed by HPLC. HPLC analyses were carried out using a DionexSummit HPLC system (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, Calif, USA) with aphotodiode array detector (Dionex PDA 100). A Dionex C18 column(4.6 mm × 150 mm; 5 μm) andguard column were used. Column temperature wasmaintained at 18°C with aTCC-100 column compartment. Mobile phase A is an aqueous solutionconsisting of 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH),10 mM potassium phosphate, and 0.125% methanol ata pH of 7.00. Mobile phase B is an aqueous solution of2.8 mM TBAOH, 100 mM potassium phosphate, and30v methanol at a pH of 5.50. A linear gradient from100% phase A to 0% phase A and then back to100% phase A was used over a 100-minute total runtime. We are applying this methodology to better understand theeffect of overexpression of genes involved in the myo-inositolpathway to ascorbic acid in the metabolism of antioxidants andenergy-related molecules in Arabidopsis plant samples.
 Automated chromatographic method developmentsystems have existed for a number of years. Difficulties intracking peaks between experiments can limit these systems,especially for samples such as impurities and degradants which mayhave many trace components to resolve. Automated methoddevelopment systems typically lack versatility, meaning thatestablished method development routines must be adjusted in orderto fit the capabilities of the automated system. Finally, forcomplex problems, method development may involve many experimentswith many samples (including composite samples), and a largeamount of data can be generated. It can take a significant amountof human time and effort to track, review, and manage thesedata.
 This presentation will describe a new system for automatedmethod development which addresses some of the weaknesses ofearlier configurations. The tool uses both UV-Vis and MS detectionto unequivocally track and resolve trace components, performing achemometric evaluation of these detection techniques. The systemalso includes data handling and storage systems designed toquickly summarize the information, and reduce the time requiredfor data review and report creation. A wide array of instrumentconfigurations and method development approaches is supported,making the system flexible for many types of laboratories.
 A robust method for the simultaneous determinationof six Se species and six As species in human urine byreversed-phase liquid chromatography with ion-pair reagent coupledwith ICP-MS has been developed. Selenium species,trimethylselenonium ion (TMSe), selenocystine (SeCys), selenite(Se(IV)), selenourea (SeUr), selenomethionine (SeMet),selenoethionine (SeEt), and arsenic species, arsenocholine (AsC),arsenobetine (AsB), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), methylarsonic acid(MMA), arsenite (AsIII), and arsenate (AsV) were separated on a WatersSymmetry C8 reversed-phase column by eluting withtetramethylammonium hydroxide at pH 5.7-5.8 adjusted by malonicacid. The total analysis took less than 10 minutes withisocratic elution at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and wasfree from the chloride isotope interference due to the completeseparation of arsenic species from chloride. The estimateddetection limits in synthetic urine at injection volume of50 μL ranged between 0.10 and 0.43 ng/mL forAs species and between 0.71 and 1.53 ng/mL for Sespecies.
 This method was applied to study the relationship betweenurinary As and Se metabolites after ingestion of 1-pound seafoodwith or without 1.0 mg of selenium supplement (as highselenium yeast) by one volunteer. From total analysis, Asexcretion increased by 31.4% with the presence of seleniumsupplement in the ingestion; Se excretion increased by 28.2%with the presence of seafood in the ingestion. The excretion ofAsB and MMA increased about 100% with the ingestion ofL-selenomethionine, while the DMA excretion changed a little. Fromthe time resolving distribution of As and Se species, it wasobserved that the excretions of MMA, DMA, TMSe, and selenosugarwere delayed, which may be explained by the competition for methylgroup between As and Se species. This study suggests that Seintake may be positively associated with urinary As excretion, andmay alter As metabolite distribution in humans, and vice versa.More experiments are needed to be carried out to confirm theseresults.
 A T-type interface and a cross-flow nebulizer wereintroduced to find ways to combine capillary electrochromatography(CEC) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)detection for analysis of selenium speciation. For the CECseparation, we employed a macrocyclic polyamine bonded phasecapillary as the separation column and a bare fused silica filledwith the make-up liquid. To optimize the measurement, weinvestigated several parameters: nebulizer gas flow rate; rotationrate of peristaltic pump; type, concentration, and pH of the mobilephase; and applied voltage. With Tris buffer (pH 8.5,50 mM), applied voltage of −15 kV, ICP Rfpower of 1200 W, nebulizer gas flow rate of1.02 l/min, and lens voltage of 6 V, thereproducibility for the retention time indicated that sampleinjected by electrokinetic and nebulizer gas flow (RSD <1.38%) was better than that by self-aspiration alone (RSD< 1.79%). The detection limits for selenate,selenite, selenocystine, and selenomethionine were found to be2.40, 3.53, 12.86, and 11.25 ng/mL, respectively. Due tothe high sensitivity and element-specific detection, as well asthe high selectivity of the bonded phase, quantitative analysis ofselenium speciation in urine was also achieved.
Online immunoextraction (IE) coupled with reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is an example of a multidimensional technique that can be used to separate and analyze structurally similar compounds from complex sample mixtures. IE makes use of the strong and selective binding of antibodies to remove and concentrate a certain group of compounds from a sample. RPLC then allows the separation of structurally similar chemicals that bind to the same IE column. IE/RPLC usually involves three columns. The first column performs immunoextraction. As analytes elute from the antibody column, a small, reversed-phase precolumn is used to trap and concentrate them before they enter the final column, the RPLC analytical column. An important component of a coupled IE/RPLC system is the interface between the IE column and the precolumn. However, little information is available on the behavior of analytes at this interface. In an effort to better understand this aspect of IE/RPLC, well-characterized analytes were used as models. The compounds studied included various chlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicides. The elution of such compounds from an IE/RPLC system under different conditions was predicted and optimized using chromatographic theory along with the known binding and dissociation rates of the IE columns and retention of the analytes on RPLC phases. Good agreement was noted between the predicted and experimental results.

Several strategies for method development in HPLC are used at present. Some scientists remain the stationary phase constant and optimize the mobile phase composition (pH, nature of mobile phase, buffer concentration) and the temperature.
Recent publications [1]recommend, in addition, a variation of the stationary phase, whereasstationary phases with selectivity as different(“orthogonal”) as possible should be used.
In phase optimized liquid chromatography (POPLC) theoptimization of the stationary phase is the first goal. Due to thefact that retention times are additive, different stationary phasesegments are coupled together to create the column with the bestoverall performance for each particular separation. The retentiontime of each analyte is controlled by the use of the bestselective column for this purpose. In POPLC, the optimum column hasto be found in an isocratic way. Nevertheless, if the mixture isvery complex and covers a wide range of polarity, gradient elutioncannot be overcome.
In this paper, we show how to optimize a separation for an unknown very complex mixture from chemical industry. The sample is completely unknown and no standards are available. It is demonstrated how we apply the concept of POPLC and which strategy has to be applied to get this method development done.
 Escherichia coli (E.coli) is perhaps the most studied of all model organisms.Pathogenic strains, such as E. coli O157 : H7, pose a significantrisk to human health. Recent findings using whole-genomeexpression profiling revealed that E. coli MG1655 genes wereinduced by the nutrients available in the mammalian intestine. Themutational analysis/microarray study found that only mutations insugar pathways affected the colonization of the bacteria. The goalof this study was to determine the in vitro metabolism preferenceof two different colonizing E. coli strains (MG1655 and EDL933)towards the 14 monosaccharides known to be found in intestinalmucus. Carbohydrate concentrations were monitored using capillaryelectrophoresis (CE) with different detection methodologies. Thedisappearance of each sugar in the growth media provided thenutritional preference of E. coli. No single capillaryelectrophoresis method could be developed to monitor all thecarbohydrates simultaneously. Instead, three independent CEmethods were required. The combination of CE-UV and CE-MS dataprovided a complete picture of the actual carbohydrate metabolismof E. coli from colonization to constant phase. The data showedthat different strains have different nutritional preferences.MG1655 did not metabolize N-acteylgalactosamine, while EDL933 did.Other sugars changed in their order of metabolism. The in vitromodel clearly indicates that certain sugars are metabolized onlyduring colonization and others during maintenance. This in vitromodel provided an enhanced view of the actual carbohydratepreference of two different strains of E. coli and demonstratedsignificant differences between the commensal and pathogenicstrains.
 We have previously developed a rapid samplingonline microdialysis technique for monitoring metabolites in theinjured human brain [1]. Morerecently, we have adapted the system to monitor the brain duringsurgery and this proved to have advantages in providing ametabolic feedback to the surgeon interoperatively [2]. We are now seeking to develop ananalytical system that allows to use the rapid samplingmicrodialysis during bowel and stomach surgeries.
 Gastrointestinal surgery is one of the most common surgicalprocedures in the developed world. Complications associated withthis type of surgery can be severe enough to lead to mortality[3]. Intestinal ischemia duringand after surgery is a major factor that can lead to multipleorgan failure [4]. Monitoringmetabolic changes in the digestive system during surgery is ofgreat interest as an early marker of intestinal ischemia. Previousattempts to monitor the bowel had monitored intraperitoneally inexperimental models [4]. Whilstsome evidence of ischemia was found, the poor time resolution ofthe assay coupled to the large volume of the intraperitonealcavity prevented this from being useful during human bowelsurgery. We have, for the first time, implanted a microdialysisprobe into the gut wall. Optimization of the online assay forbowel uses has allowed us to observe the metabolic condition ofthe tissue online throughout the surgery. This also has potentialapplications postoperatively to detect anastomosis leak.
 The online monitoring system electrochemically analyzes thedialysate for glucose and lactate at high time resolution(typically 30-second sampling). The method couples flow injectionanalysis to enzyme-based amperometry [1].
 We will describe preliminary results from monitoring patientsin St. Mary's Hospital, Imperial College, with thistechnique.
 A novel method for the determination of imipraminein flow-injection systems has been developed. The method was usedfor the fast determination of imipramine in its pharmaceuticalformulations and biological samples. The developed technique isvery simple, precise, accurate, time-saving, and economic ascompared to all previously reported methods. The effects ofvarious parameters on the sensitivity of the method wereinvestigated. The best performance was obtained with theconditions, pH value of 2.0, sweep rate value of60 V/s, accumulation potential of 100 mV, andaccumulation time of 0.5 second. In this work, we introduce aspecial computer-based numerical method, for calculation of theanalyte signal and noise reduction. The electrode response wascalculated based on partial and total charge exchanges at theelectrode surface after subtracting the background current fromnoise. The waveform potential consisting of potential steps forcleaning and accumulation of analyte, and potential ramp wereapplied on an Au disk microelectrode (with a radius of12.5 •m). The method was linear over theconcentration range of 25–75000 pg/mL (r = 0.997) with a limits ofdetection and quantitation of 13 and 30 pg/mL, respectively.The method has the requisite accuracy, sensitivity, precision, andselectivity to assay imipramine in tablet and plasma.
 Sample conditioning and sample preparationrepresent time-consuming activities involving many steps that haveto be performed manually. At high sample throughputs, theseroutine tasks constitute a considerable cost factor. Generally,analytical systems that carry out these steps automatically have alow-payback time due to lower costs, lower contamination risks, andthus more reliable analytical results. Various sample conditioningand sample preparation techniques have already been put intopractice using the ProcessLab system to be described:
filtration of water samples;extraction of organic substances;derivatization of analytes;digestion by heating under reflux;elimination of interfering components.

This paper presents a detailed description of some already realized solutions.
Water samples for ion chromatographic (IC) analysis must befree of solid particles as these can block the capillary columns.Polluted water samples must therefore be filtrated prior tochromatographic separation. After dilution with eluent, the samplealiquot is ultra-filtrated and subsequently transferred to the ICsystem. After the detection of the ionic ingredients of the sample,the system automatically starts the filtration of the next watersample.
 The setupfor the automatic extraction of some organic substances from watersamples is described. In this case, a liquid-liquid extraction isused to extract organic compounds from the aqueous sample using ann-alkane. The organic phase is used for further spectroscopic and gas chromatographic determinations.
With the available digestion module, it is possible to digest aconsiderable number of components prior to further analysis. Inthis example, the automatic determination of total phosphate andorthophosphate in water samples is described.
The modular ProcessLab system offers several sample preparationoptions and thus can be adapted to a large variety of sampletypes. The automation of different preparation steps enhancessample throughput and repeatability of the results. After samplepreparation, either the analysis is  performed in the module orsamples are transferred to external analytical systems such aschromatographic or spectroscopic devices. 
The highly flexible ProcessLab adapts to many analytical challenges.
 Many techniques are used for the concentration of samples andthe level of labor, user supervision, and recoveries  vary witheach labor. This unattended concentration technique allows the operatorto concentrate samples from a inline process such as GPC cleanupand solid phase extraction (SPE) or concentrate precollectedsamples ranging in volumes from a few to several hundredmilliliters. The samples are sequentially evaporated undermicroprocessor control with sensor feedback, concentrated to afinal endpoint with solvent exchange, and transferred to a storagevial or GC vial ready for analysis.
 Recoveries are demonstrated for a range ofapplications from environment, food, and pharmaceuticals. Thesereduced the exposure to hazardous solvents and other chemicals.
 The aim of this study was to demonstrate that nearinfrared (NIR) method combined with multivariate analysis allowsthe classification of the different commercial fuels (gasoline anddiesel) and highlights their large quality variability.
 Even though fuels have to reach commercial qualityspecifications, complexity of refining tools and crude oils slatesinvolves large variability in terms of finished productsqualities.
 The study was carried out in south east of France, on an areacovering about 20 squared miles where four major oil companies arelocated.
 20 gasolines and 15 diesel have been collected, taken fromdifferent brand gas stations and the supermarkets  (Figure 5). Many fuel mixtures have beenprepared, 160 with different gasolines and 24 with differentdiesel. Conventional properties (RON, MON, density, cetane number,etc.) were measured and the NIR spectrum was collected for eachsample.
 FT-NIR spectra were recorded with a Nicolet Antarisspectrometer interfaced to a personal computer. Diesel sampleswere filled into a 4 mm path length borosilicate glasstube. All the spectra were computed at4 cm−1 resolution between 4500 and10000 cm−1—thanks to thesoftware result integration 2.1 Thermo Nicolet. Coaddition ofsymmetrical interferograms on 10 scans was performed for eachspectrum. A reference spectrum was recorded  before each samplemeasurement on an empty tube. Gasoline spectra werecollected—thanks to a Hellma probe with immersion, connected tothe same spectrometer by NIR optical fibers.
It is impossible to differentiate one gasoline from another(Figure 6), or one dieselfrom another (Figure 7),just looking at spectra, since profiles are very similar. Thus, principal component analysis (PCA) wasperformed on the near infrared datasets to classify and distributethe products across specifically defined groups. Those groups arein agreement with the measured properties of the fuels. Partialleast-squares method (PLS) was used to model the conventionalproperties of gasolines and diesel.
This study highlighted that the variability of fuel quality canbe approached by near infrared techniques combined withstatistical analysis.

 Naturally occurring mercury in hydrocarbon matrices is veryproblematic for the hydrocarbon processing industry. It is knownto poison the catalysts used in refining and chemical production,as well as causing corrosion in aluminum heat exchangers. Thesedetrimental impacts of mercury are very costly and hazardous. As aresult, it has become increasingly important to monitor the levelsof mercury in the hydrocarbon processing industry.
In this paper, a new automated technique for accurately quantitating mercury in both light and heavy hydrocarbons is discussed. This new technique employs automated sampling, pyrolysis, gold amalgamation, and cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS).
 Supporting data will be provided to illustrate thehigh-quality results obtained through the use of such an analyzer.The capabilities of this new technique will be discussed indetail.
 The rapid extraction of chemical warfare agentsurrogate compounds from soil samples was conducted using anautomated pressurized solvent extraction instrument.Organophosphorus pesticides were used as surrogate compounds fornerve agents and extracted from soil samples to evaluate thepressurized parallel solvent extraction technology for thisapplication. The results were compared to traditional solventextraction techniques for recovery and reproducibility.
 In addition, the ability to extract and process high-volumesample loads rapidly was evaluated in a working environmentallaboratory using the extraction of PCBs from soil as a test model.Data are presented detailing the procedures, manpower, and equipmentrequired to extract 200 soil samples in one day for chemicalwarfare agents.
The DART is one of the greatest advances intechnology in our fight against crime. It offers real-timeanalysis of evidence as it was discovered by law enforcementofficers in the field generating exact mass measurements andpatterns which are then used for identification. The DART systemis composed of an ionization source that uses helium in itsexcited state to ionize a sample that is placed in the gas streamand an accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometer to detectthe ions produced. This direct analysis in real-time (DART) methodof ionization is most similar to electrospray ionization andusually, but not always, generates M+1 or M−1 ions. Butunlike electrospray, analysis by DART generates a pattern insteadof a single peak because there is no separation of a sample intoits individual components—like with gas chromotography orliquid chromatography—prior to entering the mass detector.The DART is essentially generating a unique picture (massspectrum) of numbers (exact masses) and lines (patterns) torepresent the components in a specific sample, like theingredients in a commercial product. For example, the analysis oftwo different soft drinks would generate two very uniquepattern-specific mass spectra that could be used to narrow theidentification of an unknown brown liquid received by thelaboratory as having ingredients consistent with a soda, but they would alsodifferentiate between the two and positively identify them as BrandX. As this technology is new, however, there are no databases orlibraries in existence to search DART spectra against to identifycommercial products. The FBI is currently working to develop andpopulate a searchable commercial products library.
 In most forensic analyses, a variety of analyticalstrategies are implemented for unknown cases from generalscreening methodologies for classes of drugs to specificconfirmation and quantitation of individual drugs. Despite theimprovements in instrument analysis time, two areas of sampleanalysis have been lagging: (1) sample preparation and (2) dataprocessing. In this study, the focus is on the data processing ofsamples acquired from an acid/neutral screening method utilizing agas chromatograph/mass spectrometer.
Currently, interrogating an unknown sample (entire data file) against a library is still a manual process and requires enormous amount of time. As an alternative to common library search techniques, this study will demonstrate an automated analysis method combined with the use of a mass spectral deconvolution software that rapidly screens the entire GC/MS data for a targeted list of compounds in the library and provides both qualitative and quantitative information. In some cases, just knowing that a drug is present is all that is needed. However, in other toxicological analyses, knowing how much of a drug is present is critical.
In this study, the database of acid/neutral drugs is generated and used to screen blind samples, as a way to simulate unknown sample, against the database for both qualitative and quantitative investigations. The results demonstrate that it is possible to use deconvolution software as a tool for interrogating unknown samples. As to pursue the current trend in expediting sample analysis time, data will show that it is possible to reduce the overall analysis time and yet maintain data quality.
 While methamphetamine and many other illicit drugsof abuse do not occur naturally, they are synthesized in largequantities in clandestine laboratories across the country.Unfortunately, the materials (e.g., precursors, reagents, andsolvents) are commercially available and recipes are easilyuncovered on the internet. The role of the forensic chemist is torapidly screen and identify a large number of seized evidencesamples. Previous research has shown the spectroscopicidentification of these types of materials to be attractive due tothe inherent capabilities of real-time identification of volatilesolvents, nondestructive analysis which allows analysis by aprimary identification technique, and minimal sample preparation.This work will show the advantages of using FTIR-ATR spectroscopyfor the forensic screening of unknown confiscated materials fromsuspected clandestine drug labs.
Identification of the volatile organic compounds(VOCs) that result from human decomposition have been studied bymany law enforcement groups in an effort to improve cadaver dogtraining procedures and to detect human remains in clandestinegraves. Although studies of VOCs from whole pig decomposition havebeen published, there is little information about the compoundsthat result from the decomposition of individual pig organs. Solidphase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography massspectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyze the headspace of thedecomposing pig tissues over a period of three months. Analyses oftissue samples from the decomposition of pig skin, muscle, blood,heart, liver, intestine, lung, fat, and bone were monitored everyfew hours for the first couple of days, then weekly for a periodof two months. This paper will report on the VOCs identified frompig tissue samples and compare them to the VOCs that have beenidentified from human decomposition.
 An inexpensive flow injection system for determining lowconcentration levels of nitrite employing the greiss reagentspectrophotometric method is reported.In most microanalytical systems, neither the light source nor thephotodetector is integrated into the same substrate as the fluidicchannel network. This is because the integration of all componentsnecessary for performing a total chemical analysis is very complex[1]. The work presented herein focuses on a novelintegrated optical sensor, the PEDD.
 The novel flow detector applied within this manifold is ahighly sensitive, low-cost, miniaturized light emitting diode-(LED-) based flow detector. This colorimetric detector employs twoLEDs, operating one as a light source and the other as a lightdetector. The emitter LED is forward-biased and the detector isreverse-biased. The emitter and detector LEDs hada •max of 530 nm and 660 nm, respectively.The emission spectrum of the emitter LED efficiently overlappedwith the absorbance spectrum of 9 μM NO2 as shown in Figure 8.  A simple timer circuitmeasures the time taken for the photocurrent generated by theemitter LED to discharge the detector LED from 5 V (logic1) to 1.7 V (logic 0) [2].
 The optimum emitter LED light intensity was investigated asdecreasing light intensity had previously proven to increase theresponse obtained [3]. The flow rate, dynamicrange, sensitivity, and limits of detection were investigated.Detection limits in the nanomolar range were achieved using thePEDD. For a comparative study, the dynamic range and limits ofdetection were also investigated using a plate-well reader. Highersensitivity and improved precision were obtained from the PEDDcompared to the commercially available plate-well reader.

 Automated high-throughput ammonia measurement is considered to behighly desirable in the field of water management. The simplicityof ISE-based ammonia gas-sensing electrodes has made them theworkhorses for ammonia measurements in laboratories and in fieldsof environmental monitoring. However, the success of automation wasoften hampered by the electrodes' inadequate response rateand recovery time, especially in samples with ammonia at levelslower than 1 ppm, leading to unsatisfactory accuracy andrepeatability. The high impedance of inner pH glass membrane alsomakes the electrode more susceptible to the cable movement usingthe autosampler during the measurement.
 This paper describes a newly developed system that integratesan improved ammonia gas-sensing electrode with a meter-controlledautosampler for automated, high-throughput ammonia measurements.The new electrode not only incorporates a glass membrane of lowerresistance to reduce the susceptibility of the sensor response tothe cable movement using the autosampler, but also has anoptimized configuration to improve the response rate, accuracy,and repeatability. In addition, the new electrode acquiresease-of-handling features such as a translucent body with a fillline mark, a back seal, and a preassembled membrane cap. Methoddevelopment using the new ammonia gas-sensing electrode with theautosampler is discussed. Different ISE analysis methods, such asdirect measurement, known addition, and Gran method, are compared.Factors affecting the measurement are studied, optimumis set up, and analytical sequences for varioussamples are determined. Results show that the analytical processof ammonia measurement including electrode rinsing andcalibration, reagent/standard addition, and sample measurement canbe carried out automatically without being attended by anoperator, per sample analysis may take less than3 minutes, and that satisfactory results can be obtainedin low-concentration range.
 We have designed a low-power water-quality arrayfor four sensors (pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolvedoxygen) that can be interfaced to a radiofrequency (RF) wirelessmote. RF “motes” are low-power devices thatincorporate sensors, processing, and communications in a smallpackage, which were developed by the University of California atBerkeley in 1999.
 The RF motes can receive data from multiple sensors andcommunicate with each other to transmit data to a remotely locatedPC. In particular, we discuss remote monitoring of local bodies ofwater surrounding the Suffolk University environmental researchfacility at Cobscook Bay in Edmunds township, Maine. Thewater-quality sensors are interfaced to a field mote which sendsdata to the base mote connected by USB to a dynamic web server atthe research field station. The monitoring allows year-round studyof an area with 18 ft tidal fluctuations and harshwinters. The data are archived for analysis in a database anddisplayed in “real time” at SuffolkUniversity.
 We will describe techniques used to overcome intermotedistance limitations, interface issues of the sensor board to themotes, solutions to long term power for the motes in the field,effects of submerging the sensor/mote package in water, remotecalibration of the sensors, quality of the data obtained, andsoftware modifications that are necessary for operation.
 Data are presented on the development of a newautomated system combining solid phase extraction (SPE) with GC/MSspectrometry for the single-run analysis of water samplescontaining a broad range of organic compounds. The system usescommercially available automated inline 10 mL sample extractionwith large volume injection and GC/MS. Two commercially availableSPE sorbents used in series allow extraction of both polar andnonpolar compounds. Inline injection of the 90 μL extractfrom a 10 mL sample resulted in detection limits 10–100times lower than recommended EPA method 8270 limits forsemi-volatiles. Variance in SPE extraction efficiency is directlymonitored and quantitative accuracy improved through the use of“internal” deuterated and nondeuteratedstandards/surrogates added to calibration standards, blanks andsamples prior to automated SPE concentration. System performancehas been demonstrated for 92 target organic compounds, includingacidic, basic and neutral semivolatile compounds, as well aschlorinated- and nitrogen-containing pesticides. This detectionsystem has also been successfully applied to the analysis of arange of Method 8270 semivolatile compounds in complex matricesderived from water-isopropanol extracts of contaminated sediments,resulting in enhanced sample throughput with optimum detectionlimits. Preliminary work has also demonstrated the potential forquantitation of both volatile and semivolatile compounds in asingle analysis. The performance and flexibility of this systemalong with increases in automation and reduction in solvent usageand accompanying analyst exposure make this an attractivealternative for the analysis of volatile and semivolatile organiccompounds in aqueous samples.

 We report here the synthesis and testing of a novelpolysaccharide-class chiral HPLC stationary phases based on porouszirconia. A new method for the attachment of polysaccharide withanchor groups to zirconia surface through Lewis acid-baseattachment chemistry is described. Generally, the attachment of aspecific polysaccharide chiral selector (CS), which containsmultiple phosphonic acid anchor groups per polymer chain that canthen be further bonded to a zirconia surface through a Lewisacid-base reaction, is shown. Furthermore, the synthesis of avariety of brush-type chiral selectors that contain anchor groupsfor zirconia that can be easily attached to/removed from CSPs for chiralselector screening is described. The optimum chiral separationconditions including mobile phase compositions and mobile phaseadditives were studied. The selectivity and efficiency of the newzirconia-based phases to analogous silica-based chiral stationaryphases are compared. The results indicate that the two substratescan perform similar enantiomer separations, but there aredifferences in the selectivity for most analytes tested. A numberof pharmaceutical chiral separations are shown. The zirconia-basedchiral stationary phases were found to be chemically stable frompH 1 to 8 under reversed-phase conditions. We also demonstratethat zirconia columns can be used for doing fast screening of CSPswithout the need for using multiple columns.
Segmented flow analysis (SFA) and flow injection analysis (FIA) are both continuous flow techniques that have been used for automating wet chemical methods. In addition, the flow injection technique has been widely used as a means for rapid and precise sample introduction into a variety of analytical instruments such as atomic absorption and mass spectrometers. However, sample injection has not been previously coupled with segmented flow analysis which is the subject of this paper.
 Mixing in FIA depends in part on longitudinal dispersion whichalso dilutes the sample and decreases sensitivity for longreaction times. In contrast, SFA limits longitduinal dispersionand facilitates longer reaction times, but the standard SFAsampling technique of aspiration is not precise and requires thereaction to be brought to completion. By injecting the sample intoa carrier stream which is then segmented with air, longer, butnonsteady state, reaction times can be achieved which combine toincrease both sensitivity and sample throughput.
 With an estimated worldwide turnover of more than500 million US dollars, phosphatizing is the most important metalpretreatment process. The phosphatizing process produces a hard,electrically nonconducting surface coating that adheres tightlyto the underlying metal. This layer protects the metal fromcorrosion and improves the adhesion of paints and organic finishesto be subsequently applied. 
 The basic phosphatizing process consists of the etchingreaction and the formation of the surface coating. Afterthoroughly degreasing and rinsing the metal workpieces, thephosphoric acid removes interfering surface-bound metal oxides andincreases the surface roughness. Subsequently, the alkaliphosphates react with the previously generated metal ions forminga layer of insoluble tertiary metal phosphates. Addition of metalcations such as Zn 2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, orNi2+ to the phosphatizingbath improves the quality of the coating.
 At the industrial scale, the phosphate coatings are applied tothe metal surface of the workpieces using strictly defined processsteps in different cleaning, degreasing, rinsing, activation, andphosphatizing baths. The various bath parameters have to beclosely monitored as they determine to a large extend the qualityof the coating produced. The parameters determined in thecleaning, degreasing, and rinsing baths are pH value, conductivity,plus free and total alkalinity, while the phosphatizing bath isanalyzed for free and total acids, nitrite or hydrogen peroxide,and zinc and fluoride.
 The described ProcessLab at-line analysis system controls,records, and documents the important analytical parameters of theentire phosphatizing process. The combination of the analyticalmethods involved as well as the straightforward and error-freehandling via the well-organized user interface allows for completeprocess control. The analytical functions are supplemented by theintegrated operation software that offers numerous possibilitiesfor data processing and documentation of the measured values.Additionally, a bar code reader guarantees an unambiguous sampleidentification.
The at-line analysis system meets all requirements of modern phosphatizing plants regarding process monitoring and documentation.
 Water contamination is a widespread environmentalproblem. Every year, some 700 million tons of waste enter theaqueous systems and thus reduce our already limited freshwaterresources. Maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in drinking water arespecified for a large number of inorganic ions in order tominimize potential health hazards. Highly effective monitoringtools are required for assessing the occurrence, the fate, and theenvironmental impact of contaminants.
 The analysis system described here combines titration, ionchromatography, and direct measurement. It has been speciallydeveloped for automated drinking water analysis but can be adaptedto suit any number of analytical requirements in the food,electroplating, or pharmaceutical industries. The emphasis has beenplaced on user-friendly operation, variable sample containervolumes, and protection of the samples from ambient interferences.The standard version measures the following sample parametersfully automatically and simultaneously: temperature, pH, andconductivity; it titrates acidity, calcium, and magnesium anddetermines anions with ion chromatography (Figure 9). All resultsare obtained within nine minutes. The comfortable anduser-friendly software stores and manages the results in adatabase. 
 The system's flexibility allows implementingadditional measurements extending the range of ions to bedetermined. The system equipped with two ion chromatographs allowsfor a simultaneous determination of all cations and anions. Bycalculating the difference between positive and negative totalcharges, the ion balance can be determined. Besides the integrationof various sample preparation techniques, such as dilution, fullyautomated ultrafiltration, or dialysis, it is possible toautomatically remove the lids from sealed sample vessels prior toanalysis.
The authors will give a detailed description of the setup and present results obtained by analyzing tap water from Herisau (Switzerland).

 A sensitive and simple method for the simultaneouspreconcentration of nutritionally important minerals in realsamples has been reported. The method is based on the formation ofmineral complexes by n-4-propyl-2-thiouracil(PUT) supported onactivated carbon. The metals contents on the complexes are theneluted using 5 mL 6 M HNO3, which are detected byAAS at respective maximum wavelengths. In this procedure, mineralssuch as Cu, Ni, Pb, and Co could be analyzed in one run by caringout the simultaneous separation and quantification of them. Thelow detection limits of these elements in this technique make ita superior alternative to UV-Vis and in several applications,also an alternative to ICP-MS techniques. The method has beensuccessfully applied for these metals content evaluation in somereal samples including waste water, river water, spring water, tapwater, vegetable, and cow liver.
 Karl Fischer titration is a method for determiningthe water content in different matrices, based on a selectivereaction between water and the Karl Fischer reagent. In comparisonto traditional drying methods, the Karl Fischer titration is lesstime-consuming and often more accurate; drying methods quantifythe mass loss, which can differ from the water content, especiallyin foodstuffs.
 Low water contents from approximately 0.001% to1% can be detected by coulometric Karl Fischer titration;here the iodine required is generated electrochemically in thetitration vessel. Higher water contents from approximately 1% upto 100% can be determined by volumetric Karl Fischertitration, where an iodine solution serves as titrant.
Automated Karl Fischer titration allows to deal with more samples in less time; automated sequences can include different methods for the determination of titers and blank values and for different types of samples. Moreover, automation generally improves reproducibility and accuracy.
 In this work, standard Karl Fischer methods using commerciallyavailable water standards and solvents were developed using anautomated Karl Fischer titration system. Both volumetric andcoulometric techniques were applied to different edible oils suchas soy bean, sun flower, olive, rapeseed, sesame, and pumpkin seedoil.
An essential prerequisite for automated Karl Fischer titration is complete dissolution of the sample or at least a suspension or emulsion as homogeneous as possible, as the samples are transferred from sealed glass vials through a transfer tube to the titration vessel.
 The traditional methods used to prepare foodsamples for pesticide residue analysis consume large quantities ofsolvents and large amounts of laboratory time in the sample workup process.
 This paper describes the application of pressurized solventsin the simultaneous extraction of six samples for the analysisof organochlorine pesticide residues. The results are compared tothe traditional solvent extraction technique. Many different foodmatrices (vegetable and grains) are analyzed and the preparationsteps for the successful processing of food samples aredetailed.
 In addition, the procedures, equipment, and manpower requiredto process a large number of samples in an 8-hour operatingday are described.
PTV injector with automated liner exchange was used for largevolume injection (LVI; up to 200 μL) in GC-MSanalysis of pesticide multiresidues with the aim to obtain highsensitivity and/or simplify sample preparation procedures, forexample, evaporation and solvent exchange steps. The systemperformance, for example, recovery, linearity, and repeatability,was evaluated for 106 pesticides —including organochlorine,carbamate, organophosphorous, pyrethroid and otherpesticides—dissolved in acetonitrile andacetonitrile/toluene (3/1) mixture with analyte protectant, forexample, L-Gulonic acid •-lactone. Liner exchange periodwas also evaluated for the 106 pesticides fortified in theextracts of cucumber and spinach obtained from supercritical fluidextraction (SFE).
In this paper, we will present
a rapid, sensitive, and simple LCMS method for the analysis of        paclitaxel and its metabolites in biological samples such as arteries, liver, and blood;the method will also describe a novel semiautomatic    machine used in the preparation of small amount of biological    samples for the analysis of drugs at trace level. This machine    will be applicable for tissues hard to homogenize such as    arteries, ureter, and muscles. This machine increases sample    output analysis tremendously as it is capable of loading    several samples at a time and provides a more homogeneous    preparation than the commercially available manual grinding    vessels commonly used for the preparation of limited sample    amounts. The homogenizing multiple grinding vessel machine is    being patented. the method will also discuss the presence of a ghostpeak generated from newly purchased Waters UPLC connected to apremier mass spectrometer. The ghost peak interfered with theanalysis of paclitaxel and a $500 K investment forthe analysis of paclitaxel to support preclinical studies couldhave been wasted, had not the ghost peak been successfullyeliminated. The ghost peak was UPLC material dependent and was notobserved on the micro LCMS system. The technique used totroubleshoot the problem that led to the elimination of the peakand the successful system maintenance will be presented.

 General unknown screening procedures in clinical orforensic toxicology are used to detect and identify the exogenouscompounds present in human samples, whether expected or not. Acomprehensive GUS method has been developed for drugs, toxiccompounds, and their respective metabolites in biological fluids,based on liquid chromatography coupled to a hybridtriple-quadrupole linear ion-trap mass spectrometer.
 After nonselective solid phase extraction, the compounds ofinterest are separated in gradient chromatographic conditions. Themass spectrometer is operated in the information-dependentacquisition mode, where two acquisition conditions arecontinuously alternated. In the survey scan, enhanced mass spectraare acquired, with dynamic subtraction of background noise inorder to detect even tiny peaks in the noise. Inthe dependent scan, the most intense ions in the survey scan areidentified and the instrument instantly switched to the enhancedproduct ion scan mode to select these ions in the firstquadrupole, fragment them in the collision cell using threealternated collision tensions during each scan, and accumulate theresulting fragments in the linear ion-trap to generate rich MS/MSspectra. The complete cycle time lasts for 1.36 seconds. Alibrary of MS/MS spectra of parent compounds and metabolites hasbeen built up and a computer program has beendeveloped to automatically report the results of peak finding andlibrary searching.
 This procedure was revealed to be very efficient to identifyunexpected compounds in biological samples (as far as theycorresponded to library entries), as well as to give clues aboutthe presence of metabolites owing to MS similarities with theirrespective parent compounds. More than 1000 MS/MS spectra in thepositive mode and 250 in the negative mode were entered into  thelibrary. Clinical cases will be presented where compounds notfound by other screening or target techniques could be identifiedunambiguously. 
  Purpose. To support toxicologystudies, a method was developed to determine the concentrations ofan Abbott compound in dog plasma. Method. HPLCwas used to perform online extraction and separation of thecompound and internal standard (IS). The compounds were extractedfrom the dog plasma using 96-well protein precipitation. HamiltonMicroLab was used for the transfer of samples and reagents. Acolumn-switching valve was used to direct the injected sample tothe analytical column through the SPE cartridge. A loading/washingpump was used to deliver the loading and wash solution to the SPEcartridge at a flow rate of 2 mL/min and an analyticalpump was used to deliver mobile phase to the analytical column ata flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Applied Biosystems API 4000 MSwith Analyst software and ESI interface with positive ionizationwere used for the analysis.

Thequantitative method was shown to be linear over a concentrationrange of 6.04–3774.98 ng/mL with correlationcoefficients (r) greater than 0.99. The evaluation of interrunassay of QCs was shown to have mean %bias between2.7% and 4.3% and CV between 3.5% and4.6%. No interference from blank plasma was observed.Conclusion. A fast LC-MS assay for thedetermination of Abbott compound in dog plasma was validated todetermine plasma concentrations following administration of asingle dose of drug to Beagle dogs to evaluate the cardiovascularsafety profile.
 Microdevices have proven useful in analytical andclinical chemistry providing much faster analyses, withsensitivity similar to conventional methods. This report describesa monolithic enzymatic microreactor for rapid and complete proteindigestion, integrated with a capillary monolithic C18reversed-phase for peptide separation and ESI-MS for peptideidentification. The enzymatic microreactor was prepared through anovel trypsin encapsulation/surface immobilization technique byfirst encapsulating trypsin in a UV-initiated photo-polymerizedmonolith consisting of vinyl azlactone, acrylamide, andcross-linker dissolved in porogenic solvent, then immobilizingadditional trypsin on the porous monolith surface through reactionof the azlactone functionality with amine and thiol groups on theenzyme. The enzymatic activity was initially evaluated usingon-chip digestion of N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE),insulin chain B, and cytochrome c, and the stability of the enzymewas measured by the change in enzyme activity with time. Theoptimized microreactor enabled fast digestion of proteins with alow back pressure flow through the microreactor. On-chip digestswere directly coupled to a monolithic C18 reversed-phase forpeptide separation. The reversed-phase column consisted of a 5 cmlong porous poly(stearyl-methacrylate-co-ethylene dimethacrylate)monolith within a 200 um i.d. capillary, which was coupled with amass spectrometer for peptide identification. Multiple proteinsdigested on the enzymatic microreactor-μLC-ESI-MS/MS for systemevaluation.
 Beta blockers are important clinical drugs used inthe treatment of various cardiovascular disorders. They are toxicand have a very narrow therapeutic range. Beta Blockers are alsolisted as doping-controlled substances because of theirsympathomimetic properties and activity as anabolic agents. It isimportant to measure and monitor beta blockers in biologicalsamples for disease diagnosing, therapeutic monitoring, dopingscreening, and forensic analysis.
 We developed a high-speed RP LC/ESI+ MS/MS method of analysisfor the quantitative determination of nine beta blockers andmetabolites acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, labetalol,metoprolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol, and timolol in humanplasma. Beta blockers were extracted from samples using StrataX-C, a mixed mode cation ion exchange, and hydrophilic and hydrophobicSPE sorbents, with simple washing steps. LC separation wasperformed on a high pH stable Gemini 3 μm C18 50× 2.0 mm column, with gradient elution, using5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH = 10, buffer as aqueousmobile phase, and acetonitrile as organic modifier, in4 minutes. At the same time, LC/ESI+ MS/MS responses ofbeta blockers were evaluated in 0.1% formic acid in waterand acetonitrile mobile phase and compared to responses in high pHmobile phase. Higher signals were recorded in high pH mobile phasethan in acidic mobile phase in most cases, and high pH mobilephase provided higher sensitivities for beta blocker analysis. Theabsolute recoveries of beta blockers from spiked human plasma bySPE were greater than 60% at LOQ of 0.5 ng/mLconcentration. Method precision (RSD%) was <15%, and linear regressions were higher than or equal to0.999 in a wide dynamic range (>103) while usingoxprenolol as internal standard.
Background. Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA),previously named as heteroauxin, is a crucial hormone, a few detailsof its metabolism and its functions in plants and humans areknown, due to the lack of a high-throughput sensitive methodmeasuring IAA and its intermediates/metabolites such asindole-3-carbinol (IOH) and indole-3-acetonitrile (ICN)simultaneously. In the present study, we will discuss IAAmeasurement using UPLC connected online with either ion-trap ortriple-quadruple MS with ESI interface.  Methods.The UPLC-ITMS coupling was composed of a Waters Acquity UPLCequipped with a BEH C18 shielded column (1.7 mm, 100× 2.1 mm) operated under MassLynx 4.0 software anda Thermo LTQ ITMS operated under Xcalibur 1.4 software. Mobilephases were ammonium acetate and acetonitrile. A Thermo SurveyorHPLC was used to test 6 columns: Synergi hydro-RP18, Onyxmonolithic C18, ChromoLith endcapped monolithic RP18, Lunaphenyl-hexyl, Luna NH2, andPolyLC polyhydroxyethyl. The UPLC-MS/MS coupling was composed ofan acquity equipped with a BEH C18 shielded column(1.7 mm, 100 × 1 mm) and a Waters QuattroPremier MS/MS. Results. For IAA, IOH, and ICN, themonitored ions were m/z 174 → m/z 130 forIAA, m/z 146 → m/z 128 for IOH, and m/z 155 for ICN. Withconventional HPLC, the PolyLC column was the best in terms ofselectivity and sensitivity. Compared to HPLC, UPLC significantlyshortened analysis time and increased sensitivity, with the peaksof IAA at 0.74 minute, IOH at 1.28 minutes, and ICN at2.27 minutes. The UPLC-MS/MS reached IAA LOD to 1 pgper injection (10 μL), much more sensitive than thatof 64 pg per injection (5 μL), using theUPLC-ITMS. Using the UPLC-MS/MS,the calibration curves of IAA, IOH, and ICN were linear from 0 to500 mg/L. Conclusions. We have developeda high throughput, sensitive, and accurate UPLC-MS method todetermine auxin and its key intermediate metabolites in a 3-minuterun analysis.
 In this work, we have investigated conditions formonitoring dopamine in vivo by microdialysis coupled online toelectrokinetic chromatography and laser-induced fluorescence(EKC-LIF) using a dendrimer pseudostationary phase (PSP). We havefound that dopamine could be monitored in vivo using onlinederivatization of dialysate by 6 mM naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde, and 10 mM potassium cyanide followed byEKC separation using 6.5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)as the PSP with 2 mM(2-hydroxypropyl)-•-cyclodextrin as a buffer additive.Application of 14.5 kV to a 17.5 cm 10 mmi.d. fused silica capillary allows dopamine to be resolved fromother amines in brain samples in 90 seconds. Increased temporalresolution would allow for closer to real time monitoring of rapidchanges in dopamine levels; therefore we are exploring methods forincreasing the speed of separation. It was found that maximaldopamine resolution  obtained at SDS concentrations was justequal to the critical micelle concentration. We have hypothesizedthat dopamine is strongly partitioned in the phase and fasterresolution could be obtained by using lower concentrations of PSPor a PSP in which dopamine is less retained. To achieve lowermicelle concentrations, we are using several generations of thestarburst dendrimer poly(amido-amine) as PSPs. Starburstdendrimers are not dependent on noncovalent aggregation andtherefore they do not require a minimal concentration to form. We willdescribe the use of PSP and optimization of other parametersincluding applied voltage, column length, and buffer compositionfor improving the speed of dopamine separation for in vivomonitoring.
The analysis of copolymers, for instance, by gel permeationChromatography (GPC) for parameters which, in the case of blockcopolymers, might include block length, molecular weight of theblocks, and percent composition, and in the case of randomcopolymers, might include sequence length and rate ofincorporation, is a fairly complex problem. When the two monomershave different chemistries, the use of two detectors may allow someof the above parameters to be calculated by exploiting spectraldifferences. However, when the two monomers have very similarchemistries and therefore very similar spectral characteristics,as, for example, could be the case in the copolymerization ofacrylic monomers, the analysis by conventional GPC is essentiallyimpossible. Here we describe the application of automaticcontinuous online monitoring of polymerization (ACOMP) reactionsto the free radical copolymerization of acrylic comonomers, whosespectral characteristics are very similar. Determination of theinstantaneous concentration of each comonomer during the reactionis made possible by incorporating a full spectrum UVspectrophotometer in addition to refractive index, lightscattering, and viscosity detectors in a “detectortrain.” Data and results for the copolymerization of butylacrylate (BA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) monitored underdifferent starting composition ratios are presented. Continuousconversion kinetics, composition drift, and average compositiondistribution are calculated from the data, in addition to theevolution of average intrinsic viscosity and weight average molarmass Mw.
 Purpose. Plastic pellets produced for foodpackaging and water pipes need to be tested for their residualsolvents or monomers responsible for the “plasticsmell” on finished products. This test, performed bysensory panel, requires days for sample preparation and a frequentavailability of panelists.   Method. The posterwill present how an electronic nose instrument can be used toimprove the aroma/flavor testing of HDPE pellets used in waterpipe manufacturing. In order to do so, a sample of HDPE comingfrom each produced batch was analyzed with a quality-controlelectronic nose. This instrument includes an array of 6cross-selective sensors to perform the analysis of volatilecompounds. Results. Results obtained by oneleading polyolefin company at its Quality Control lab over aperiod of several months will show the high level of correlationbetween instrumental and human assessments (no false positive and1.3% of false negative, i.e., 1.3% samples wereconsidered as bad by the E-Nose whereas they were acceptable forthe human panel).  Conclusion. This instrumentalmeasurement is now on track for standard approval certificationorganisms.
 Automation and robotics have played a key role ingenomics, by relieving researchers of the need to performrepetitive operations on large numbers of samples. Aurora Biomedhas introduced the VERSA Mini family of application-specificliquid handling workstations. This modular family offers flexibleexpansion options for a broad spectrum of applications, enablingscientists to carry out a wide variety of dispensing andcontamination-free pipetting tasks in the laboratory. Thefollowing study discusses the performance of one of the members ofthe VERSA Mini family that is designed to perform the task of PCRreaction setup in low- to medium-throughput environments. The studyhighlights PCR screening of 1500 cloned vector colonies generatedfrom a subtraction cDNA library (pGEMT-EZ) construct. End-pointPCR amplification profiles were analyzed using standard gelelectrophoresis. The terms of speed and accuracy were comparedto the manual performance. The fully automated VERSA Mini workstation,equipped with a single channel, was capable of screening the entirelibrary in a single work-day. The reliable results conclusivelyshowed that this workstation has capabilities in performingautomated genomic screening as an alternative to manualperformance.
 Optical sensor arrays have been fabricated in whichmicrospheres are fixed to the end of optical imaging fibers. Anumber of different formats have been developed to use thesearrays for multiplexed assays. For environmental monitoring ofmicrobial contamination, nucleic acid testing is being developed.These assays are based on hybridization of either DNA or RNA fromthe microbes onto appropriately designed probes attached to themicrospheres on the array. The arrays have been used to detectcontamination of biological agents in sewage, harmful algal bloomsin seawater, and infectious agents in drinking water. 
 In vivo sampling and monitoring are attractive forseveral reasons, including reduced labor and materials costs,reduced disturbance of the studied system, reduced potential forerror, elimination of separate sampling and monitoring steps, areduced chance of sample change/loss during storage, and theimmediateness of the data, which facilitates timely decisionmaking. The requirements, however, place limitations on thetechnologies that can be applied for the analysis. This overviewis intended to review the current status of in vivo sampling, andidentify the strengths and challenges observed by itspractitioners.
 LC/ESI-TOFMS offers significant advantages over conventionalLC/MS and GC/MS techniques. LC/ESI-TOFMS can be used to measurethe monoisotopic mass of pseudomolecular ions to within betterthan 3 mDa. A second dimension for identification is thedegree to which the isotopic pattern (isotopic ratio and accuracyon every isotope) of a detected compound agrees with thetheoretical pattern of any analyte (SigmaFitTM).
 However, as no MRM-type experiments for selectivity arerequired, a large range of analytes can be screened for at once.In addition, spectral interferences only hinder detection if theirm/z values cannot be resolved at resolution of R > 15000.
 A general drug screening protocol has been developed to detecta wide range of prohibited substances in equine and canine urineusing this technique.
 Various SPE procedures were used and the extracts were combined andevaluated for their suitability for LC/TOFMS analysis. Bothpositive and negative ionization modes were employed to giveadequate sensitivity for all analytes.
 A database was established containing the molecular formulaand where known, the retention time of all compounds of interest.Data processing software was developed to create and integrateextracted ion chromatograms of the target pseudomolecular ions inthe database within a very narrow mass window (+/−3 mDa). Postprocessing software evaluates the spectra byusing matching criteria based on mass accuracy of thepseudomolecular ion, that is, SigmaFitTM and retention time. Qualitativefindings are then reported automatically in an easilyinterpretable form.
 The screening protocol was shown to meet the requiredperformance specifications for the large majority of theprohibited substances evaluated. LC/ESI-TOFMS analysis can deliversignificant savings with respect to sample preparation andanalysis time by allowing simplified extraction procedures andanalyzing groups of compounds simultaneously that aretraditionally handled separately.
 This paper is being submitted for the symposium,achievements, and challenges in mass spectrometry. We describeautomated analysis of multiple samples by high field (9.4 and 14.5tesla) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) massspectrometry. Mass resolving power is routinely greater than100 000 at 1 Hz scan rate, and can exceed one million asnecessary. Accurate mass can be achieved by use of an internalcalibrant (typically ∼100 parts-per-billion rms error for petroleum samples at 9.4 T) or by combination of external calibration and automatic gain control (AGC) of the number of ions injected into the ICR trap (typically ∼500 ppb for broadband and ∼50 ppb for selected ions at 14.5 T). Dynamic range can exceed 1000 : 1 for a single measurement and increases with the square root of the number of averaged measurements. Several MS/MS fragmentation techniques are available and complementary, including collisionally activated (CAD in the linear trap), infrared multiphoton (IRMPD in the ICR cell), and electron capture dissociation (ECD in the ICR cell). Representative applications include petrochemical analysis and proteome profiling with an electrospray robot, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange LC MS for elucidation of protein binding sites (with programmable sample handling). Conceptual design of a 21 tesla ICR magnet is complete and will be described. In addition to field strength, magnet characteristics such as field homogeneity, temporal stability, stray field, size, and cryogenic performance are critical.

 Chemicals are dispersed by numerous accidental, deliberate, orweather-related events. Often, rapid analyses are desired todelineate areas of contamination and to identify dispersedchemicals. Hundreds of wipe samples might be collected frombuilding interiors or outdoor surfaces both before and after anyremediation. A DART/oa-TOFMS analyzes compounds in ambient air inseconds on surfaces such as a cotton swab without requiringextraction, extract cleanup, or chromatography. The open designof the ionization region enabled construction of a simple,$250 autosampler based on N-scale model railroadcomponents and 3′ ×1/4″ square aluminum rods. Holes spaced15/32″ apart from cotton swabs through each ofthe 14 rods provide for analysis of 1000 samples. Using a rod as thecore of a field sampling fixture to provide cotton swab wipesamples that are almost ready for analysis upon receipt mightenable one analyst to perform 1000 analyses in one 8-hour shift.In addition, an in-house ion correlation program (ICP) has beenused to deconvolute composite mass spectra from multiple analyteson a single cotton swab based on exact masses of monoisotopic ionsand the relative isotopic abundances of their +1 and +2 isotopicpeaks rather than on the retention time differences of ionsprovided by chromatography. After mass spectral deconvolution,each of several compounds was identified from its elementalcomposition. The autosampler, integrated fieldsampler/autosampler, ICP, and preliminary data will be described.

 In the modern analytical lab there is increasing demand forhigher-throughput methods and for analysis of more complexsamples. This is, in part, a result of improvements ininstrumentation which has increased our expectations for both theamount of information obtained from a given sample as well as howquickly that information may be garnered. With respect tohigher-throughput analyses, recent improvements in HPLC technologyhave resulted in dramatic reductions in analytical run times withchromatographic peak widths beginning to approach that of GCseparations. However, very few detectors are currently capable ofproviding data acquisition speeds that match these fastchromatographic separations. One of the most useful detectors forsuch applications has become time-of-flight mass spectrometry(TOFMS), primarily due to its high data acquisition density andits usefulness as an identification tool. TOFMS also boasts high,full mass range sensitivity making it an attractive tool forcomplex samples in which many unknown compounds must be detected.Unfortunately, when analyzing large numbers of complex samples, abottleneck is often introduced at the data processing and reviewstage. In an effort to relieve this bottleneck, promising advancesin data processing software have been developed and include bothqualitative and quantitative tools. In this presentation, sampleapplications in the areas of food analysis and metabolomics,demonstrating the benefits of a fast acquisition TOFMS instrumentfor both high-speed separations and analyses of complex samples,are described. Additionally, integrated software tools forautomated data processing, including chromatographic peak finding,mass spectral deconvolution, sample comparison, and automatedlibrary searching will be demonstrated.
 Computerized design of separations inreversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is today a mature technologywhich is used worldwide in industrial settings, due to thecapability to make potential problems with the RPC method moretransparent. The major advantage is however to learn quickly howto avoid experiments of limited quality. As today there is arequest to define the quality of an RPC method prior tovalidation, the importance of the definition, why a certainworking point (pH, temperature, %B, etc.) is selected, andhow much tolerance should be allowed, is more and more recognized.The paper will compile a few historical milestones on how thistechnology emerged and will honor Lloyd Snyder, who played aleading role in this development.
 The authentication of virgin olive oil samplesrequires usually the use of sophisticated and very expensiveanalytical techniques; so there is a need for fast and inexpensiveanalytical techniques for use in a quality-control methodology.Virgin olive oils present intense fluorescence spectra.Synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy (SEEFS)was assessed for origin determination of virgin olive oil samplesfrom five French registered designations of origins (RDOs) (Nyons,Vallée des Baux, Aix-en-Provence, Haute-Provence, andNice). The spectra present bands between 600 and 700 nm inemission due to chlorophylls a and b and pheophytins a and b. Thebands between 275 and 400 nm in emission were attributedto tocopherols and phenolic compounds, which characterize thevirgin olive oils compared to other edible oils. The chemometrictreatment (PLS1) of synchronous excitation-emission fluorescencespectra allows one to determine the origin of the oils from fiveFrench RDOs (Baux, Aix, Haute-Provence, Nice, and Nyons). Resultswere quite satisfactory, despite the similarity between twodenominations of origin (Baux and Aix) that are composed by somecommon cultivars (Aglandau and Salonenque). The interpretation ofthe regression coefficients shows that RDOs are correlated tochlorophylls, pheophytins, tocopherols, and phenols compounds,which are different for each origin. SEEFS is part of a globalanalytic methodology that associates spectroscopic andchromatographic techniques. This approach can be used fortraceability and vindicates the RDOs. 
 In this work, we will show applications of recentlydeveloped surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates inthe detection of pesticides and water contaminants. Due to thehigh sensitivity provided by engineered disposable substrates,analyte concentrations as low as ppm-ppb can be detected by SERSwith a portable Raman instrument.
 Gold-coated regular arrays of micron-size inverted pyramidfeatures are the core of the SERS substrates used in this work.Geometry and size of the textured metal are key to the sensitivityand reproducibility. Typical enhancements and RSD reproducibilityof the SERS substrates used in this work are>104−106 and<5%, respectively. The substrates have beenoptimized to give maximum enhancement in the NIR spectral range inorder to minimize the fluorescence contributions by molecules ormatrices. All the measurements reported in this work have beenperformed with compact Raman systems at 785 nm. Typicalacquisition exposure times used for all analytes are10–60 seconds.
 SERS spectra have been detected for several organophosphateinsecticides and herbicides at trace level concentrations.Thorough testing of  range concentrations of pesticides incombination with a SERS substrate has shown how SERS could beused in assessing the purity of water.
 Performance and practicality of sampling methods will bereviewed to demonstrate the viability of SERS as practical routineanalytical technique.
 Osteoporosis is the bone disease that is associated with bonemass loss or the breakdown of the bone matrix which leads to anincreased risk in bone fracture. Osteoporosis is not only a bonedisease in humans but it also occurs in animals, particularly layingbirds like chicken that use a substantial amount of calcium tomake the egg shell. A major amount of the calcium used for eggshell formation is intestinal calcium obtained directly from thediet. However, as laying chickens grow older, their ability toabsorb calcium from the diet diminishes but their calciumrequirement for egg shell formation remains the same. Additionalcalcium is obtained from the bones by bone resorption throughincreased hydrogen ion concentration around the bone joints, aprocess that ultimately results in osteoporosis.
 Plasma or serum amino acid screening has clinical significancein different diseases, and studies on bone fracture healing haveshown that the serum concentration of free hydroxyproline iscorrelated with collagen metabolism in bone. Several methods havebeen developed to measure hydroxyproline, including colorimetricmethods, HPLC, and GC/MS. In this project, a GCxGC method has beendeveloped for the screening of amino acids in blood plasma. TheGCxGC method was developed primarily to reduce the samplepreparation time involved with the other methods from 3–6hours to under 90 minutes. Another significant benefit of theGCxGC method is the comprehensive screening of the entire aminoacid profile including hydroxyproline, which may eventually beuseful as a diagnostic indicator for other diseases besidesosteoporosis. Details of the experimental protocol andquantitative results comparing the GCxGC and the colorimetricmethod will be discussed.
 DNA/mRNA detection techniques play an important role inmolecular biology. One of the biggest interests in modern biologyis to decipher the transcription and translation processes insidea living cell. One of the tools available is molecular beacons(MBs) which offer several advantages over traditional techniques.However, MBs can be degraded by nucleases inside a living cell,which makes the analysis challenging. To overcome the limitationobserved from MBs, we have designed hybrid molecular probe (HMP) forintracellular mRNA analysis in living cells. Briefly, the probeconsists of two single strands of DNA which are linked by a PEG(polyethylene glycol) linker. On the 5′ end ofone strand, a fluorescence donor is attached and to the3′ end of the other strand, another fluorophoreacting as an acceptor is attached. When a target that contains thecomplementary sequences hybridizes to the probe, the twofluorophores are brought within close proximity allowing FRET tooccur. PEG keeps the two strands together allowing efficienttarget hybridization. In order to increase both the selectivityand sensitivity of the probe inside a living cell, we incorporatein the probe design locked nucleic acids (LNAs). Modification withLNAs protects the probe from nuclease digestion, while improvingits binding affinity to access highly structure mRNA sequences.The excellent affinity and stability that LNA offers combined withthe detection capabilities of the HMP promise an outstanding toolfor DNA/mRNA monitoring. Another excellent option to increase thesensitivity of the probe will be the integration of double donorsin the HMP. This will increase FRET, therefore higher signalenhancement for the probe upon hybridization with the target. Theoptimal design of the probe will be applied to prepare probestargeting important cancer-relateed-genes such as MnSOD for thestudy of the expression of these genes in disease cells atsingle-cell levels.
 Multivariate optical computing (MOC) is a method bywhich an analyte characteristic of interest is predicted viaoptical regression using a specialized interference filter calleda multivariate optical element (MOE). Previous work in ourlaboratory has investigated the design and fabrication processes ofMOEs and their use in MOC systems in the UV-visible region. Morerecent studies have probed into the consequences of spectralresolution on the theoretical design of MOEs for application workin the near infrared (NIR) region. The work presented here willexamine the actual application of an MOC system designed for aspectrally dense open binary organic mixture of naphthalene andpyrene in the nominal 1675 to 2500 nm region. The actualfabrication process of an appropriate MOE with relation to spectralresolution for this binary organic system will also beincluded.
 Near infrared spectroscopy in the combination ofspectral region is currently being evaluated for use inimplementing noninvasive measurements of blood glucose. In ourlaboratory, transmission measurements through the thin skin on theback of the hand are being studied for their applicability to thenoninvasive glucose measurement problem. In initial work, a ratanimal model is being employed to simulate measurements in humans.With the rat model, a fiber optic interface is used to maketransmission measurements through the skin at the base of the neckof the anesthetized animal. Comparisons of spectra collected inthis manner to analogous spectra collected from the back of thehands of human subjects reveal a close spectral match. Byacquiring spectra continuously as glucose excursions are inducedin the rat, datasets are being obtained for use in exploringmethods to quantify glucose in these noninvasive spectra.Challenges to a successful calibration include the presence ofmany sources of measurement variance, as well as the difficulty ofextracting the small glucose signature from the many overlappingspectral components of the tissue matrix. In this presentation,multivariate calibration methods will be explored for theirutility in building robust predictive models for glucose innoninvasive spectra. What of particular interest in this work is theperformance of hybrid calibration methods that combine the spectraof known tissue constituents with abstract components derivedempirically from spectral background measurements. To evaluatethese calibration methods, datasets acquired from multiple ratswill be used. Issues to be addressed include the ability to applycalibration models across different rats and the ability toovercome the various sources of data variance associated with thenoninvasive measurements.
 Conducting composite electrodes are versatiledevices for biomedical applications showing good biocompatibility,low cost, and ease of construction. They can be bulk modified withstabilized enzymes to make biosensors and electrodes for biofuelcells [1]. Low sensitivity to flowconditions arises from the microelectrode array-like behavior butthis is accompanied by high capacitance and bulk resistance whichcan blur the voltammetric detail [2].
We have undertaken a systematic investigation of the effects ofcomposition and formulation on the voltammetric behavior andnonfaradaic properties. Monodisperse glassy carbon balls havebeen used to simplify the modelling and the relative importance ofthe patterns of surface conductivity and bulk 3D connectivity hasbeen investigated. Three-dimensional numerical models based onpercolation theory have been constructed which allow calculationof the distributed resistances in the composite and enablequalitative prediction of the voltammetric properties.
Voltammetric results showed a bias of E0(half-reaction potential) and an unstable il  (diffusion limiting current) forconducting composite electrodes. AC impedance showed dramaticvariation of Rct (charge transferresistance) and Cd (double layercapacitance) with composition and thickness. Comparison withcarbon fiber arrays enabled separation of the effects of adistributed interface from three-dimensional disparities in theconductance. Key findings are as follows. The distributed resistance inelectrodes results in shifts in E0 and the overlap ofdiffusion layers leads to a potential dependentil.
Numerical results show the shifts in E0 andil which are in agreement withexperiments.
Simultaneous scanning electrochemical/near-field optical/atomicforce microscopy (SECM/NSOM/AFM) was developed and applied to thelocal mapping of a living cell. A novel bent-type probe wasapplied, which consists of an optical fiber surrounded by a goldring electrode, and an outermost electrophoretic insulatingpolymer. The tip of the bent-type probe was fabricated by afocused ion beam (FIB) process having an aperture size of about100 nm. Therefore, the tip has both near-field optical andelectrochemical properties. The electrochemical properties wereevaluated by cyclic voltammetry in 10 mM potassiumferricyanide solution, containing 500 mM of KCl. Thecyclic voltammogram showed a sigmoidal response with adiffusion-limited current Id of 0.73 nA. This indicates anelectrode diameter in the nanometer order. To control the distancebetween the probe and the substrate, an optical feedback mechanismwas employed. In the SECM/NOSM/AFM setup, the electrochemicalresponse at the tip electrode was monitored with a potentiostat andthe near-field optical signal with an avalanche photo detectorthrough a lens, and the atomic force was detected via an opticalfeedback system. The imaging capability of the SECM/NSOM/AFMtechnique was confirmed by simultaneous acquisition ofelectrochemical, near-field optical, and topographical images of aninterdigitated array electrode (1 μm gold bandsspaced by 2 μm glass) in an aqueous redox-activesolution containing 3.0 mM hydroxymethylferrocene and500 mM KCl. Simultaneous imaging with SECM/NSOM/AFMrevealed that the images obtained in the SECM mode (positivefeedback while scanning over gold layers and negative feedbackover glass) and the NSOM mode corresponded to the ones observed inthe AFM mode. The resolution level of each imaging mode was foundto be 100 nm for SECM, 80 nm for NSOM, and100 nm for AFM. Therefore, all three modes are useful forthe local mapping of the biochemical activity of a living cell. Weselected PC12 cells, which are often used as a model for neurons.We demonstrated that SECM/NSOM/AFM can be used for imagingneuritis (1–5 μm) of differentiated PC12cells and for detecting varicosities (about 100 nm wide)related to the release of catecholamines in the neuritis (Figure 11).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitro substituted PAHs (NO2-PAHs) are a group of environmental pollutants formed during incomplete combustion. NO2-PAHs are especially important since they have been reported to account for over 50% of the direct mutagenicity in ambient air. Some of them are estimated to be up to four orders of magnitudes more mutagenic and ten times more carcinogenic than PAHs. The main source for NO2-PAHs in the atmosphere is diesel exhaust. After entering the body, NO2-PAHs are metabolized to aromatic amines before conjugation and/or excretion in urine. Certain amino-PAHs have been suggested as possible biomarkers for diesel exhaust exposure, such as 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-abz) and 1-amino-pyrene (1-apyr).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently developing methodology to measure amino-PAHs and related compounds in human urine. The method involves acid deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, and analysis by gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS). Deconjugation using different acids has been evaluated and compared to enzymatic deconjugation. After acid hydrolysis, the sample mixture was washed with pentane, basified with sodium hydroxide, and extracted with dichloromethane/pentane (vol 1 : 1). The final extracts (∼8 mL) were evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen, reconstituted in toluene, and analyzed by GC/HRMS in the selective ion monitoring mode. Complete separation was achieved using an RTX-35 amine column and quantification was accomplished using four 13C-labeled amino-PAHs as internal standards, spiked into the urine samples before extraction. This method will be applied in the future for the analysis of samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), performed by CDC to assess exposure of the US population to environmental pollutants.
 An investigation into the medicinally activechemical constituents of prairie plants utilized by the PlainsIndians is ongoing in our laboratories. Our current investigationis on the rhizomes of Acorus calamus (sweetflag). The rhizomes contain aromatic oil that has been usedmedicinally since ancient times and A.calamus is cultivated in Asia for this reason. Therhizomes are considered to possess antispasmodic, carminative, andanthelmintic properties and also used for the treatment ofepilepsy, mental ailments, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, bronchialcatarrh, intermittent fevers, and glandular and abdominal tumors.They are also employed for kidney and liver troubles, rheumatism,sinusitis, diabetes, and eczema. The methanolic extracts ofA. calamus rhizomes were investigated byreversed-phase liquid chromatography electron impact massspectrometry (LC/EI/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry(GC/EI/MS). The polar constituents are of interest since PlainsIndians frequently made teas or other preparations utilizingaqueous extractions. While LC/ESI/MS works well for polarmolecules of known identity, the difference in fragmentationpatterns among ESI instruments and the lack of extensive ESIlibraries make the identification of the components in a complexmixture very difficult. This method permits the rapid assessmentof plant extracts for the presence of medicinally active compoundswith a minimum of prepurification. In LC/EI/MS, the effluent froman HPLC is introduced into an electron impact ionization sourcegiving typical and well-understood EI spectra. The advantage toacquiring EI fragmentation data from an LC separation lies withinthe subsequent ability to use existing deconvolution and searchprograms to match results with well-established and commerciallyavailable EI mass spectral databases.
 An important step in small molecule drug discoveryand development is the synthesis of substances derived frominvestigational compounds. These related substances includeproducts and metabolites that are commonly a result of oxidativeprocesses. Several studies utilizing electrochemical (EC) flowcells online with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)and mass spectrometry (MS) have demonstrated thatelectrochemically derived products often correspond to biologicalmetabolites and chemical degradants. It is of interest to thedrug-discovery process to be able to synthesize these oxidativemetabolites in microgram quantities for further evaluation.
 The objective of these studies is to examine the use ofcontrolled-potential electrolysis in flowing solution as a meansof small-scale synthesis to facilitate pharmaceutical analyses indiscovery and development. The experimental apparatus consisted ofan HPLC system, where inline EC flow cells comprised of large surfacearea flow through working electrodes, followed by UV and MSdetectors. Results using microgram quantities of startingmaterials have indicated selective and semiquantitative formationof oxidative products such as N-dealkylation of amitriptyline.Reaction cells were placed before the HPLC columns to allowseparation, concentration, and purification of reactants andproducts. Results from optimization of conditions for productyield and purity will be discussed in the context of electrodesize, concentration of starting material, cell potentials, andflow rates.
 Proteomics is increasingly used to gain greaterunderstanding of the many functions of mitochondria in metabolismand metabolic disease. Increased use of proteomics has beenfacilitated by simplifications in protein identification bymethods such as 2D-PAGE, MALDI-MS, and Edman sequencing.Immunochemical detection has high specificity and sensitivity, andlarge sample throughput. However, these detection methods alsorequire multistep liquid handling and are time-intensive. The useof antibody/antigen-modified capillary columns presents advantagesover traditional immunochemical methods. The capillary geometryimproves assay kinetics due to the higher surface-to-volume ratioand restricted diffusion of compounds. In addition, capillarycolumns are more suitable for automation, and consumption ofimmunoreagents is minimized due to the small dimensions ofcapillaries. With the realization of significance of proteins inmetabolism and metabolic diseases, a high-throughput instrumentfor the detection of proteins is of increasing importance. Afive-channel prototype instrument was developed for multisample,highly automated, rapid detection of proteins in serum samplesusing optical detection. For detection of proteins, capillarycolumns were modified with a primary antibody. After capture ofproteins, a secondary antibody was applied and detected usingenzyme labeled anti-IgG and the substrate. The assay can becompleted in less than 3 hours per 10 samples. For vinculin, alinear detection range of 0∼18.8 μg/mL (0∼160 nM) was obtained with a lower limit ofdetection (LOD) of 0.5 μg/mL (4.3 nM). Forcytochrome c, a linear detection range of 0∼0.5 μg/mL (0∼41.7 nM) was obtainedwith an LOD of 0.01 g/mL (0.83 nM). All theantibodies used were evaluated with ELISA prior to the capillarycolumn tests. It was demonstrated that the immunosensor hassufficient sensitivity to detect the target proteins in lymphocytesamples.
Development of rapid methods for routine food analysis and quality control is an urgent task. For example, determination of the antibiotics' concentration in milk is an essential part of milk analysis performed in the diary plant. Reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, the content of antibiotics in milk should not exceed limits that are allowed for human consumption. Secondly, if the milk used for production of fermented dairy products contains too much antibiotics, they may inhibit growth and development of the added bacterial culture and, consequently, the quality of the final product will deteriorate. Currently used procedure requires milk inoculation with bacterial culture, incubation during three hours, and consequent determination of the amount of the produced lactic acid by the titration. Since activity of the bacterial culture depends on the amount of antibiotics present in milk, concentration of lactic acid produced during milk fermentation is correlated to the antibiotics content. Evidently, there is an interest in the developing of much faster and less laborious procedure for milk quality control.
 Electronic tongue multisensor systems appear to be promisingtool for such task.
The present work is devoted to the development of an analytical procedure for ET for rapid antibiotics' detection in raw milk.
 Electronic tongue developed in the Laboratory of ChemicalSensors of Saint Petersburg state University was used for milkmeasurements.
 Sample preparation consisted in addition of differentquantities of penicilline to milk, milkinoculation with bacterial culture, and incubation.
 PCA score plot of measurements made in milk samples thatcontained 2 ppb of penicillin after 0, 20, 40, and 60minutes of incubation is shown in Figure 12. The difference between inoculated milk samples containing 0 and 2 ppb of penicillin became pronounced already after 20 minutes of fermentation.
During the next experiment, milk samples containing 0, 2, 3, and 10 ppb of penicillin and inoculated by bacterial culture were measured using the ET. Calibration models with respect to the penicillin content in milk were made using PLS regression for each incubation time. An acceptable calibration model was obtained using the data from the measurements made already 30 minutes after inoculation of milk. RMSEC was found to be 0.02 and RMSEP was found to be 0.13 in this case.
The ET was demonstrated to be viable and fast method of antibiotics detection in milk.
 Intrinsically unstructured proteins classify a group ofproteins lacking global tertiary structure. It is found that uponbinding to a target molecule, many of these unstructured proteinsinductively fold. This conformational change coupled to thebinding event can be utilized in the development of detectionassays for target molecules by conjugating a transduction moietyto the unstructured protein. A small fragment of the BRCA1 tumorsuppressor protein (residues 219–498) has been found tobind another tumor suppressor protein. This region of BRCA1has been classified as unstructured via circular dichroism (CD)spectroscopy, as seen in  Figure 13. A strong dip at approximately205 nm confirms the unstructured nature of the peptide. Aconformational change in the BRCA1 region results from the p53(residues 355–393)/BRCA1 binding event. Thisconformational change was characterized by the CD spectrawhich shows that the disordered content ofthe BRCA1 diminishes upon binding of the p53 peptide to the BRCA1peptide. Observed quenching of the BRCA1 intrinsic tryptophanfluorescence upon addition of p53 is also  evidence of thisconformational change. Our hypothesis is that a similarquenching can result in the fluorescence of a probe attached toBRCA1 upon addition of p53. This quenching in fluorescence canthen be related to the amount of p53 present in the sample. Todevelop a fluorescence-based detection assay, tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR) was conjugated through the thiolmoiety of cysteine residues on BRCA1. The BRCA1-TMR conjugates wascharacterized in terms of its fluorescence properties. Upon mixingof p53 and BRCA1-TMR conjugate, a change in the fluorescencesignal was observed, which was correlated with the amount of p53present in the sample. Control studies were performed usingmolecules that do not interact with BRCA1. This biosensor based onunstructured proteins may be applied to numerous unstructuredprotein-target binding pairs.

Salmonella typhimurium contamination in meat(beef) is a critical concern. There is a need to develop rapid andreliable methods for detection of Salmonellastatus in beef to ensure consumer safety. Thus, amultidisciplinary project is underway to develop intelligentsensors for rapid detection of  Salmonellacontamination in beef based on olfactory sensing of headspacegases. Since in real-world conditions, other spoilage bacteriacould also grow along with  Salmonella, it wasconsidered a priority to identify the volatile compounds due to Salmonella contamination alone.
 Beef strip loins were aseptically transferred to sterileheadspace vials, inoculated with Salmonellatyphimurium and stored at20°C for 4 days.The volatiles generated in the headspace of the vials wereinvestigated each day using headspace solid phase microextraction(HS-SPME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS). Microbiological analyses of both inoculated and controlsamples were also carried out to obtain Salmonella population.
 HS-SPME/GC-MS detected several volatile compounds in theheadspace of beef samples, inoculated with   Salmonellatyphimurium, namely, carbon dioxide, ethanol, acetone,carbon disulphide, 2,3-butanedione, ethyl acetate, acetic acid,3-hydroxy-2-butanone, dimethyl disulphide, and also a fewhydrocarbons. However, these compounds were also detected in theheadspace of the control samples.
 Acetic acid, ethanol, carbon dioxide, and 3-hydroxy-2-butanonewere the most important compounds identified in the study. Two-wayANOVA with storage time and sample source (inoculated and controled)as the model factors were used to analyze the data. The F-tests(Fisher's variance ratio) for the main effect of thesample source established acetic acid, ethanol, and carbon dioxideas potential useful indicator compounds forSalmonella-contaminated fresh beef samples. Goodlinear correlations were found between the logarithm of averagepeak area response and Salmonella count(log10 cfu/g) for all the four compounds, thatis, acetic acid (r = 0.99), carbon dioxide (r = 0.99), 3-hydroxy-2-butanone (r = 0.99), and ethanol (r = 0.89).

 In traditional HPLC configurations, some of themodules are not very well utilized. For example, the autosampler isidle for most of the time and a thermostatted column compartmentcould hold more than one column. The situation can be improved ifthese modules could be utilized in more than one system.
 By using a dual gradient pump (two independent pumps in oneenclosure) and an additional detector, a system suitable for“parallel chromatography” can be configured. Inthis setup, the column compartment and autosampler are sharedbetween two HPLC systems (the two pumps are assigned to their ownsystem). This approach nearly doubles the throughput and can beused for isocratic as well as gradient methods. Another advantageis that this gain in productivity can be reached without modifyingand revalidating the existing analytical method. However, controlof such a complex system requires powerful software.
In this poster, we present an intelligent software solution for controlling shared devices. From the user's point of view, the instruments behave as two independent HPLC systems, although physically only “one and a quarter”  systems is present. The software automatically takes care of the sharing process (e.g., manages exclusive access to the autosampler), and handles potential issues (e.g., in case of problems with one of the systems, the other one can continue).
With a relatively little additional cost, intelligent module sharing between HPLC systems can almost double the productivity of a traditional HPLC system, without the need for modifying and revalidating existing analytical methods.
HPLC is often perceived as a complex technique. Even the mostreliable hardware will eventually fail. The amount of time neededfor troubleshooting and repair strongly influences the uptime ofthe instrumentation and, as a result, overall laboratoryproductivity. Therefore it is important to quickly find the sourceof the issue and resolve it.
Diagnosing instrument problems is not easy. Although diagnostic tests are often built on simple principles (e.g., watching a pressure drop to find leaks), the actual procedure is in most cases rather complex. The user must observe many side conditions, and the results are sometimes difficultto interpret.
In this poster, we present an advanced approach ofcomputer-aided diagnostic tests and online troubleshooting guides.The module-based tests are intuitive and easy to use. The user isguided step by step through the procedure. The results aredisplayed both graphically and numerically with pass/failevaluation. In addition, the results can be printed and/or stored.Once the issue is identified, an online troubleshooting guidehelps to provide immediate remedy.
The advanced module-based diagnostics and the onlinetroubleshooting guides ensure minimum instrument downtime forincreased productivity.
Disposable pipette extraction (DPX) is a rapidmethod that utilizes solid phase extraction in a pipette tip. Thesorbent is mixed with the sample solution using DPX, and thisleads to reproducibe and rapid extractions that take less thanapproximately 2 minutes to perform. Another main advantage of DPXis that the method can be readily automated with most commercialliquid handlers.
DPX methods for the extraction of drugs and metabolites fromserum, urine, and saliva samples are introduced. Also, automatedsolutions for hands-free sample preparation are presented.Examples of rapid DPX extraction combined with rapidchromatography are also presented, and the ability to use thesemethods for faster, less expensive, and more accurate results thanimmunoassay methods is discussed. Also, examples ofhigh-throughput screening are provided.
Selenium is recognized as essentialelement and has a large number of biological functions in humanorganism. The most important action is its antioxidant effectbecause Se is in the active center of glutathione peroxidaseenzyme. The Food and Nutrition Board of United States ResearchCouncil proposed an appropriate and estimated safe daily intake ofSe for healthy man and woman adults of 70 and55 μg/day, respectively. The toxicity causes chronicpoisoning called alkali disease in livestock. On the other hand,Se deficiency promotes Keshan and Kaschin-Beck diseases, mainly,in the Chinese population.
The major source of Se for the general population is food, suchas Brazil nuts. However, the Se content of food is highlydependent on the amount of Se in the soil. In the case of Brazilnut, Se concentration of Acre to Rondonia and Manaus to Belemranges to 0.03–32 μg/g and2–512 μg/g, respectively. Studies showedthat half of a nut with Se concentration of 126 μg/gcontains the per-day quantity recommended for a person of70 kg. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate theexcretion of Se in urine after ingestion of a portion of Brazilnuts. Six volunteers (3 men and 3 women) consumed 5 nuts(approximately 18 g) and their urines were collectedduring 24 hours. The first urine samples were collectedimmediately before the ingestion of the Brazil nuts (8:00 am) andthe others were collected every 1 hour, until 9:00 pm. The first urines ofthe day after were also collected for all volunteers. In all urinesamples, Se was determined by electrothermal atomic absorptionspectrometry (ETAAS). Additionally, creatinine was also determinedaccording to reaction of creatinine with picrate in alkalinesolution to form a red-orange product that can be properlydetected by UV-vis spectrophotometry (• = 510 nm). The creatinine concentrations in the urine samples ranged from 1.3 to 2.1 g/L.
 The maximum concentrations of Se were observedbetween 4 and 6 hours after eating the Brazil nuts. Thebaselines were getting after 10 hours. For 4 volunteers, theSe concentration ranged from 61 to 130 μg/L. Forthe other two volunteers, it ranged from 658 to714 μg/L.
It is important to point out that sex, age, and dietdifferences can influence the Se excretion.
Drug determination requires optimizedchromatographic methods in order to quantitatively determine theidentity and amount of drugs in a biological sample. However, manymethods are either specific for a class of compounds or takeupwards of twenty to thirty minutes to resolve a multiclasssample. A need for a fast, simple, multiclass analysis is clearlypresent in this field. Using chromatographic figures of merit suchas multivariate selectivity and applying parallel factor analysis(PARAFAC) to three-way data, we seek to develop and optimize afast liquid chromatography-diode array detection (LC-DAD) methodthat is able to distinguish and quantify a synthetic 20-componenturine sample containing common drugs of abuse and theirmetabolites. This method can then be transferred to the moresensitive LC-mass spectrometry (MS) for conclusive results.
The chemical oxygen demanding (COD) value is the common indexof total organic pollutants in seawater. This value was tested bythe oxidizing reaction of organic pollutants in seawater underalkali and heating conditions with a known amount of superfluouspotassium permanganate.K2MnO4 wasgenerated quantitatively. The concentration ofMnO4−,which indicates the COD value, is measured by a 721spectrophotometer at the wave length of430 nm: (1)MnO4− + OH− + oxygen demanding materials = MnO42− + H2O + CO2. 
The mixture of the potassium biphthalate and EDTA was employed as standard material to give out the criterion curve of COD. The experimental results show that when the COD in seawater is between 0.5 and 5.0 mg/L, the method is fast, sensitive, reliable, and simple.
There are several demands and requirements imposedon chemists performing volatile organic analysis intoday's environmental laboratory. The first and mostimportant thing is that the analysis must be performed in compliancewith USEPA methodologies. Next, there is a continued trend toachieve lower levels of detection. Purge and trap technologyoffers a method for the extraction and concentration of theseVOCs from multiple matrices such as waters and soils. USEPA method 524.2 measures a wide range of compounds in drinkingwater with typical detection levels at sub-ppb-levels coupled withstringent quality-control requirements. Although drinking water isa clean matrix, there are still several analytical concerns whichmust be considered.
This paper will present the optimum purge and trap systemparameters particularly the water management conditions used incompliance with the method 524.2 to provide the necessarysensitivity, linearity, and accuracy. Analytical results includingcalibration factors, method detection limits, and reproducibilitydata will be shown meeting all quality assurance criteria.
A rapid assay for the determination of aspartame indiet beverages was automated on a discrete wet chemistry analyzer.The method is customizable to different calibration ranges toaccommodate different matrices. This method replaces a slower HPLCmethod currently in use. A large increase in efficiency was seenfrom the HPLC method, which requires a 10-minute pretreatment ofthe sample, to the discrete method where the pretreatment wasautomated to 30 seconds per sample. Two calibration ranges will bepresented with supporting data at both  high and low levels fordiet beverages.
The new discrete method automates an existing manual enzymaticmethod using the analyzer to perform all dispensing, dilutions,mixing, incubating, and photometric readings of the reactions. Thedetection of aspartame requires three enzyme reactions, after theinitial treatment at high pH, to remove the methyl group from theL-phenylalanine residue.
The method uses a total volume of 111 μL pertest, blanking of each sample to correct for color or turbidity,and two incubations totaling 7 minutes. The reaction cuvette isautomatically discarded after the photometric reading is complete.The use of disposable cuvettes prevents carryover contaminationfrom becoming a factor in the analysis. Different calibrationranges specific to matrix are recommended for best accuracy.
Soybeans are known to contain the nine isoflavone glycosides,daidzin, glycitin, genistin,6″-O-Malonyldaidzin,6″-O-Malonylglycitin,6″-O-Malonylgenistin,6″-O-Acetyldaidzin,6″-O-Acetylglycitin and6″-O-Acetylgenistin, and their correspondingaglycones, daidzein, glycitein, and genistein. Soy isoflavones arestructurally similar to endogenous estrogens, and demonstrate bothestrogenic activities and antiestrogenic activities.Soy-containing foods and dietary supplements are widely consumedfor putative health benefits (e.g., reduction of osteoporosis,relief of menopausal symptoms, breast cancer chemoprevention).However, there is also some concern that excessive intake of soyisoflavones could stimulate tumor growth in women withestrogen-related cancers. Recently, increasing interest hasfocused on the determination of the levels of isoflavones insoy-derived foods and estimation of isoflavones in the dailyintake.
This study developed a high-throughput method for quantifyingisoflavones in soybeans, soy foods, and dietary supplements byRP-HPLC. Twelve isoflavones were completely resolved within 10minutes by using a silica-based C18 column specially designed forseparation of highly polar compounds (Hydrosphere C18 column, 50× 4.6 mm i.d., 3 micron, YMC Co., Ltd.),with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and water containing3% acetic acid. The effective sample preparationconditions were also determined, comparing the effects oftemperature, solvent, and extraction time.
Laboratories regularly have to analyze a variety ofparameters from the same sample set. Often more than one HPLCmethod is needed to obtain the required results. Variousstrategies may be adopted to eventually increase productivity.
Traditionally, the user runs one method and manually switchesto the other method. The manual method changeover makes itimpossible to consecutively run the methods unattended over nightor the weekend. This results in increased labor time compromisingproductivity.
Another approach would run each method on a dedicated HPLCsystem at the same time. This approach requires two separate HPLCsystems and enough bench space. Both systems have to be operatedsimultaneously by possibly two different users.
An alternative concept-automated applicationswitching is based on a novel dual gradient systemoccupying the same bench space as one system. The user sets upboth methods. The system runs the first method, then automaticallyswitches to the other method without any additional userinterference. This approach frees operator time, increases systemusage time, allows automation, and thus boosts productivity.
This poster demonstrates implementation and benefits of usingautomated application switching in the food and beverage market.Two typical food and beverage routine analyses of the same sampleare used for this purpose.
Smaller laboratories often do not have the luxury ofenough routine samples for managers to feel that there is adequatejustification for the capital investment of an autoanalyzer.Continuous flow analyzers, though highly flexible forms ofautomation, can be expensive because of the time required inmethod changeovers. Discrete analyzers open the door to automationfor smaller labs. Discrete analyzers are very cost-effectivebecause a single instrument can analyze almost every wet chemistryparameter.
With the versatility and simplicity of discrete analyzers, it ispossible to economically analyze samples of widely varyingmatrices without the need for batching. Samples can be analyzedwhen received, or immediately after preliminary digestions andextractions. This poster illustrates the ease of automatedmeasurement of multiple analytes from different sample matrices ona Discrete Analyzer introduced by OI Analytical.
Recently, high price of crude oil is big issue all over theworld. The situation makes nonoil producing countries harder.Most governments in these countries impose high taxes on oilproducts such as gasoline. For this reason, many illegal fuels aretraded and most of those illegal fuels have low quality. Theseillegal fuels may bring troubles to vehicles and causeenvironmental problems including air, water, and/or soilpollution. We have developed a transportable automated diesel fuelanalyzer for field detection of impurities in diesel fuel. Thisdiesel analyzer, located inside  a car, consists of automaticpumping system and PDA spectrophotometer to check the quality ofdiesel fuel using colorimetric quantitative method at the gasstation. If impurities are mixed in, reagent will cause the colorchange of the diesel in about 1 minute during refueling process. Alaptop computer with analysis software would identify anddetermine the concentration of impurities (Figure 14). Three peristaltic pumpsare used for sample transportation and two syringe pumps forprecise sample volume metering. The injected diesel and reagentare transferred to a mixing vessel with stirring assembly by thosepumps. A photodiode array technology provides unmatched speed ofabout 1 second for measuring entire visible area and stabilitywith nonmoving parts in the spectrograph. The integratedtwo-position automatic referencing stage ensures reproducible andaccurate results by automatic baseline correction.
From injection to draining of diesel, all processes are automatically controlled by a laptop computer via USB communication. This system will help fuel producing companies and/or government agencies involved in controlling environment or checking fuel quality. Results are shown in Table 1. 
Sensor arrays systems such as electronic noses andelectronic tongues have generated a great level of interest in theanalytical laboratories of the world’s leading food, flavorsand fragrance, packaging, and pharmaceutical companies, as wellas in the environment as a fast, simple, and reliable method ofaroma/VOC analysis. Over the last few years, the sensor arrayssystems have demonstrated their ability to provide industrialsolutions and the ability to transfer expert knowledge from theR&D and trained sensory panels into a productionenvironment for quality assurance and control. Flavors quality,intensities, and taste quality control attracts an increasing levelof attention from many companies. Those systemsreduce the needs for sensory evaluation or GC/HPLC and provide addedsafety when performing taste or olfaction assessments. They aresimple to use and extremely fast.
Monitoring the environment around living cells is a key type ofexperiment in physiology, pharmacology, cell biology, and drugdiscovery. Microfluidics offers the potential to revolutionizethis type of experiment by integrating cell culture and chemicalanalysis systems with automation, high throughput, and precisecontrol. In our laboratory, we have explored this concept bydeveloping microfluidic chip that can monitor hormone secretionfrom living cells. We are using islets of Langerhans andmonitoring insulin and glucagon secretion as a model system. Inthe chip, single islets are perfused with cell culture media andthe perfusate is analyzed by an on-chip, electrophoretic immunoassayfor insulin or glucagon. We have demonstrated that these chips canbe used continuously without operator intervention for24 hours (corresponding to 17 000 assays). This long-termmonitoring will be important for monitoring slow changes insecretion. We have also developed a chip that allows up to 15islets to be monitored independently for high-throughputoperation. These chips have application for fundamental diabetesresearch and as clinical tools in evaluating transplantableislets.
We have elsewhere in this meeting (Boutelle et al.[1]) used rapid sampling onlinemicrodialysis to measure the neurochemical signature of transient,spontaneous spreading depolarizations (SDs) detected in the injuredhuman brain. It is not possible to decide from the measuredelectrocorticography signal alone whether the underlying neuronaltissue has a healthy response (increased blood flow) or theparadoxical fall in blood flow found in greatly at risk-tissue. Toresolve this issue, a series of in vivoexperiments was carried out in collaboration with the Max PlankInstitute for neurophysiology, Cologne.
The experiments were carried out in the anaesthetized cortex.Local intracortical DC potential and extracellular [K+]levels were recorded using twin barrel ion-selectivemicroelectrodes. A microdialysis probe was (Microbiotech) placedin the cortex and perfused at 1 mLmin−1. The dialysate stream was analyzed onlinefor glucose and lactate using flow injection amperometric biosensorand for dialysate potassium using an online flow cell. Finally,cerebral blood flow was imaged quantitatively across the corticalsurface using laser speckle imaging (Strong et al. [2]).
SDs were initiated in otherwise healthy tissue bymicroinjection of KCl and characterized using the microelectrodesand blood flow imaging as they tracked across the corticalsurface. Comparison of tissue responses distant from themicrodialysis probe, adjacent to the probe, and following the probeshowed no significant difference. Analysis of the dialysate streamshowed a [K+] transient increase that coincided withthe arrival of the increase in blood flow and the [K+] change seen in the tissue. This depolarizationwas associated with a transient increase in dialysate lactate level anda fall in dialysate glucose levels that had not been resolved within30 minutes. This suggests that despite a 100%increase in blood flow, the metabolic demands of the SDoverwhelmed the local glucose supply in even otherwise healthytissue. The prolonged depression of glucose levels suggests thatif such an event repeated, as often happens clinically, it couldcompromise tissue viability.
Plants are a primary source of folates in the human diet whilepteridines are vital precursors for folate synthesis. AlthoughKohashi has analyzed for the presence of pteridines in a limitednumber of plants using high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), and fluorescence analysis,very little is known about the levels, structures, and pathways ofsynthesis and turnover of pteridines in plants. Recently,Hosssain, Schubert, and colleagues [PNAS101:5158–5163(2004)] increased pteridine levels in plants1200-fold through metabolic engineering. The increase in pteridinesynthesis resulted in a corresponding enhancement in total folatesin these plants. In this study, the presence and accumulation of anumber of known and unidentified pteridines were reported. Inorder to understand the relationships between these pteridines andtheir role in plant metabolism, it is crucial to identify andmeasure the levels of the pteridines that accumulate in thesegenetically modified plants. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) offersan alternative and complementary method to HPLC and TLC toidentify and quantify pteridines in plants. In an effort toprovide a rapid and sensitive complementary technique, we havedeveloped a method using capillary electrophoresis combined withlaser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to identify and quantify thepteridine levels in plant samples of wild-type nontransgenic andtransgenic plants engineered for increased pteridine synthesis.Specifically, nine pteridine derivatives were analyzed:6,7-dimethylpterin, 6-biopterin, D-(+)-neopterin,6-hydroxymethylpterin, pterin, monapterin, xanthopterin,isoxanthoperin, and pterin-6-carboxylic acid. The detailedinformation on the experimental conditions (such as bufferstrength and pH, injection parameters, operating potentials, andwavelengths of excitation and emission), limits of detection,linearity, and methods of statistical analysis will bedescribed.
Micro-free flow electrophoresis (μ-FFE) is ananalytical separation technique that continuously separatesanalytes based on electrophoretic mobility differences asillustrated in Figure 15. A 70 μm widechannel allows for continuous injection of sample into a1 cm wide channel pumped with separation buffer, creatinga single sample stream under laminar flow conditions. An electricfield is applied laterally to separate the single stream into themultiple components. The microfluidic chip was fabricated usinganodic bonding of two etched and electrode-deposited wafers. Toeliminate electrolysis product formation during separations,four-fold deeper channels were etched for the electrodes tofacilitate a 16-time greater linear velocity. The removal ofelectrolysis products increased resolution of fluorescentstandards by a factor of 1.3 under similar separation conditions.Also, the new design allowed for a four-fold increase in appliedelectric field to 586 V/cm before joule heating conditionspersisted. Bandwidths of a set of fluorescent standards weremeasured under different experimental conditions to determine themain cause of band broadening. A migration distance squareddependent mechanism was identified under nondiffusion limitedconditions. Considering this, minimization of migration distance,possibly through suppression or modification of electroosmoticflow, allows for the highest resolution of analytes and efficiencyof separations. Also, fundamental equations were derived todescribe total peak variance, plate height and number, andresolution. Linear velocity emerged as an important variable foroptimization. In addition, analyte streams can be preciselypositioned in the separation channel based on linear velocity,total mobility, and applied electric field. Separations ofbiomolecules have been performed to show the improvedfunctionality of the μ-FFE through knowledge gained from thefundamental studies.
Three matrices (tomatoes, green salad, lemons) wereused in the study. All matrices were spiked at 4 levels(0.01–0.1 mg/kg) with a total of around 260pesticides. Extraction and cleanup were done with theQuEChERS1 method according to Anastassiades et al. [1] and determination with the GC/MS inscan and SIM modes. Method validation will be performed anddiscussed.
Reviewing of full scan GC/MS data for pesticide residueconfirmation can be a labor-intensive and time-consuming processwhich requires concentration and experience. A new deconvolutionsoftware is able to process a complex food extract total ionchromatogram (TIC) in the order of 1-2 minutes, whereas anexperienced analyst may take more than 10 minutes to achieve thesame quality of results.
The deconvolution was done using AMDIS software (developed byNIST). AMDIS looks at every ion's apex and rising andfalling patterns (peak width) throughout the TIC to extractrelated ions together into a deconvoluted spectrum. The matrixbackground or interference ions would then be left out of thedeconvoluted spectrum. Each deconvoluted (cleaned) spectrum isthen searched against a target library for hits.
Previous work was based on the sample preparation method according to Specht and Tillkes (modified DFG S19 method, ASU L 00.00-34) [2] and the result screener for data analysis. This presentation will compare the “old” and “new” approaches.
Samples generated in support of purity and stability studies can be very complex. Closely related substances, disparate levels, and unknown analytes often present at low levels (0.1 to 0.05% or less) provide significant challenges for method development. In addition, as selectivity is manipulated and elution orders change, these same challenges make it even more difficult to track or identify peaks in the final method. This situation is particularly troublesome when trying to automate method development. Methods must also be robust, especially in the case of long-term stability studies, as they may be in use for long periods of time.
In this presentation, we will demonstrate a new way ofcompletely automating the development of chromatographic methodsfor samples generated in support of purity and stability studiesby employing new software algorithms and mass spectrometry (MS).Software tools will be described that fully automate column andmethod selection, while using MS to track and identify individualanalytes, even at the low and/or disparate levels required. Inaddition, we will also illustrate a new way of developing methodsfrom composite samples generated under multiple forced degradationconditions. Gains in sensitivity, resolution, and separation speedmade possible by the use of sub-two micron particle size columnchemistries will also be reported. Using this system approach,high-sensitivity, high-resolution methods can be developed in afraction of time compared to traditional techniques.
The online combination of electrochemistry, liquidchromatography, and mass spectrometry (EC/LC/MS) allows to mimickthe cytochrome P450 mediated oxidative metabolism ofpharmaceuticals in the body. In a large volume flow-throughelectrochemical cell, which allows for the quantitative conversion ofthe target compounds under optimum conditions, drugs can beoxidized to their phase I metabolites. Further reactions,especially with scavenging compounds like thiols, can lead to therespective phase II products. The phase I and phase II metabolites canbe separated and further characterized by online LC/MS. 
The detoxification mechanism of paracetamol in the body wassuccessfully mimicked using this online EC/LC/MS combination.Paracetamol was oxidized at a porous glassy carbon workingelectrode at a potential of 600 mV versus Pd/H2 underformation of the intermediate N-acetyl benzoquinoneimine. In asubsequent reaction, the quinoneimine was quenched by formation ofisomeric adducts with glutathione or N-acetylcysteine via thethiol function. The adducts were characterized online by liquidchromatography/mass spectrometry. The observed reactions weresimilar to those observed under catalysis of cytochrome P450enzymes in the body. The formation of the thiol adducts wasstudied in absence and in presence of other thiol compounds thatcompeted for the reaction with the quinoneimine. Although thereare differences observed between kind and abundance of metabolitesin the body and in EC/LC/MS experiments, it is evident that thetechnique may become a very valuable tool for pharmacologicalstudies of new drug candidates.
Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and amperometry at carbonfiber microelectrodes have been used for electrochemicalmeasurement of dopamine (DA) dynamics in brain tissue. Eachtechnique has expressed advantages and disadvantages. Amperometryhas a fast temporal response because it immediately oxidizesmolecules that contact the surface. The amperometry responsetherefore gives an accurate representation of DA dynamics.However, it lacks the selectivity achieved with FSCV. The temporalresponse of FSCV is limited by the rate of adsorption of DA to theelectrode which must be removed by deconvolution techniques.Temporal resolution becomes especially important in transgenicanimal models with faster than normal DA uptake. In these animals,it is possible that the rate constant of uptake will match orexceed that of the adsorption rate constant. A combined approachusing FSCV and amperometry for measurement of release and uptakedynamics will allow for complete characterization of animals withfaster than normal uptake. Acutely prepared murine brain slicesfrom wild-type mice and mice expressing increased numbers ofdopamine transporters (DATs) were characterized with FSCV andamperometry. The temporal response was compared for bothtechniques; amperometric traces showed a response more rapid thanFSCV. Dopamine uptake in transgenic mice was evaluated using FSCVand pharmacological manipulation. Amperometry was explored as asecond way to verify uptake rate constants obtained with FSCV.Amperometry will serve as an important supplement in systems whereuptake exceeds the temporal response of FSCV.
Adenosine is an important neuromodulator that regulatescerebral blood flow, modulates neurotransmission, and may beneuroprotective during stroke. Direct measurements of adenosinehave been made using microdialysis sampling, but the temporalresolution is poor (usually 10 minutes), and the probe maydamage blood-brain barrier. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes arefrequently used as chemical sensors in biological preparationsbecause of their small size and fast electron transfer kinetics.The goal of this study was to develop a method to determinephysiological concentrations of adenosine at carbon-fibermicroelectrodes using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. A waveform fordetection was optimized. The potential was scanned from−0.4 to 1.5 V and back at 400 V/s,sufficient to oxidize adenosine. Two oxidation peaks were detectedfor adenosine with T-650 carbon fibers. The second oxidation peakat 1.0 V occurs after the initial oxidation at1.5 V and is due to a sequential oxidation step. Themechanism of the two oxidation peaks was studied by varying theswitching potential and observing cyclic voltammograms takendirectly after introduction of adenosine in the flow cell. Thelimits of detection limits were 15 nM, less than the50–200 nM estimates of basal levels. The scan ratewas varied and the kinetics were adsorption-controlled. The linearrange of concentration detection was 200 nM to20 μM. Possible biological interferents werestudied. The electrode was 3 to 5 times more sensitive foradenosine than AMP and ATP because of the negative holdingpotential. Guanine had an oxidation potential of 1.1 V andcould be discriminated from adenosine in mixtures. Inosine was notdetected at these potentials. These studies demonstrate thatcarbon-fiber microelectrodes can be used to detect physiologicalconcentrations of adenosine and show promise for use as in vivoadenosine sensors.
Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy offers a painless andconvenient method for measuring glucose concentrationsnoninvasively, thereby enhancing frequent monitoring and delayingmedical complications of diabetes. Compared with single-beamspectra, absorbance spectra generally facilitate the developmentof linear calibration models and remove nonanalyte spectralvariance if background spectra provide good match to samplematrix. However, the mismatch between sample and backgroundspectra can be so severe in complex matrix like blood that itseriously degrades analytical performance. The work presented heredemonstrates the potential of ultrafiltrate glucose measurementsby analyzing samples collected from bovine blood, and furthercompares the single-beam and absorbance spectra on quantificationability.
Blood samples were obtained from ten cows from a local abattoirimmediately after each animal was sacrificed. The blood was storedwith EDTA as an anticoagulant and then passed through a KrosFlohollow fiber ultrafiltration module coupled with a Materflexperistaltic pump. In all, 100 standard solutions were preparedfrom the collected ultrafiltrate and these samples were preparedwith randomized concentrations of glucose, urea, and triacetin. NIRspectra were collected over the combination spectral region of thenear infrared spectrum with Nicolet Nexus 670 Fourier transformspectrometer. Both single-beam and absorbance spectra were used tobuild partial least-square (PLS) calibration models for glucoseand urea. Results demonstrate excellent calibration performancefor measuring glucose and urea from single-beam and absorbancespectra. Correlations between pure component spectra and thecorresponding PLS regression vectors indicate that the calibrationmodels built from single-beam and absorbance spectra are basedspecifically on glucose spectral information. Furthermore, a purecomponent selectivity analysis confirms the selectivity of thesecalibration models.
NIR process monitoring is a proven technology widely used inmultiple industries. The most successful applications are relatedto moisture analysis, as well as analysis of concentrated organicmaterials in solid form or nonaqueous liquids. NIR analysis ofdiluted multicomponent aqueous solutions presents multiplechallenges.
Spectra are dominated by water features.Analyzed components do not have their own spectral features and provide small shifts of water spectra.Shifts of water spectra due to chemical changes are very similar and typically smaller in magnitude than shifts related to temperature changes.Effects for dilute solutions are usually on the noise level of commercial instruments.

For more than half a century, the chemical manufacturingindustry has produced commodity chemicals by scaling up 1-literlaboratory syntheses to million gallons per yearproductions. In the past few years, a new approach to chemicalmanufacturing is emerging, that is numbering-up.This new approach is based on two recent developments, parallelsynthesis employed in combinatorial chemistry, and small-scalereactors that utilize the high surface-to-volume ratio at thenano- and microscales to improve chemical reactivity andselectivity. Many researches have shown that microreactors offer anumber of advantages over traditional large-scale reactors,principally increased control of reaction pathways and henceproduct choice and yield. This is particularly true in thepharmaceutical industry where only small-scale synthesis isrequired until clinical trials are complete; at which timefull-scale production needs to be accomplished in the shortestpossible period. One of the most often used reaction steps duringthe synthesis of pharmaceuticals is protecting carboxylic acidgroups by esterification. We have been developing Ramanspectroscopy as a novel analytical tool to monitor and controlchemistry in such small-scale reactors. Here, we will present Ramanspectra of the esterification of benzoic acid, an importantpharmaceutical reaction performed in a 5 mL continuous loopreactor, as well as rapid formulation development of a specialtysol-gel/polyethylene fiber.
Many sample preparatory processes involve concentration at oneor more steps. Traditional concentration systems vary in theiramount of automation and final volume precision.
A new concentration system offers a flexible platform to meet the varied concentration needs of laboratories. The system can be programmed to process up to 72 samples without user intervention. Sample volumes from hundreds to a few milliliters can be concentrated. Level sensors are utilized to constantly control the sample volume during processing. Flexible endpoint and quantitation options allow the user to program the system based on the target analyte list. The sample is then transferred to a vial ready for analysis. Programmable rinses are performed prior to the next sample.
This presentation shows the ability of a single concentrationsystem to conduct multiple steps and decrease sample handling.
Insuring the quality of our drinking water is becoming anincreasingly important and challenging mandate for municipal waterplant operators. Among today's most pressing issuesare
meeting tighter regulatory limits for disinfection by products (e.g., carcinogens);making and managing the shift from free chlorine to chloramination;collecting a more detailed analytical profile of the distribution system;managing and acting on real-time field data.
meeting tighter regulatory limits for disinfection by products (e.g., carcinogens);
making and managing the shift from free chlorine to chloramination;
collecting a more detailed analytical profile of the distribution system;
managing and acting on real-time field data.
To help meet these challenges, we have developed anelectrochemical lab-on-a-chip sensor technology and associatedinstrumentation. This technology, consisting of an array ofpotentiometric, amperometric, and conductance sensors, delivers awater profile with 8 measured parameters and 6 calculated resultsin less than 5 minutes. Included in the analysis are pH, calciumhardness, carbon dioxide, free chlorine, total chlorine, ammonia,conductivity, and ORP.
An important application of this technology is monitoringthe parameters necessary to prevent nitrification. The use ofchloramination, chlorine combined with ammonia, is increasinglybeing used as the residual disinfectant. A difficulty with the useof monochloramine is that it decomposes, as it passes through thedistribution system, thereby liberating ammonia. The loss ofmonochloramine along with increasing ammonia levels producesconditions which are conducive to the microbial growth. In aprocess known as nitrification, these microbes convert ammonia tonitrate. Once nitrification begins, microbial growth acceleratesrapidly, but with frequent monitoring for key parameters, operatorscan adjust water chemistry appropriately, thereby preventingnitrification.

RHEOTEK USA presents a breakthrough inpolymer viscosity testing. Current manual solution viscositymeasurements, with their inherent inaccuracies and variability,often lead to costly retests and production delays whenlaboratory data and manufacturing data differ. RHEOTEK USA, inconjunction with ISO 17025 accredited laboratory Poulten Selfeand Lee Ltd., has identified the common variability insolution viscosity test methods. RHEOTEK has developed a robust,fully automated, laboratory practice to measure solution viscosity(IV) correctly at the first time, and every time.
Together, we will journey through a case study concerning theASTM D 4603 method determination of IV ofpoly(ethylene terepthalate). Our discussion will include samplepreparation using weight-to-volume versus weight-to-weightmethods, sample dissolution time versus temperature, low molecularweight polymers versus high molecular weight polymers, surfacearea of the polymer samples, and insoluble matter. We will alsodiscuss how to design in-house studies to determine thevariability of the viscosity measurement, the variability of thesample preparation, and the variability of the sample itself andhow our automated polymer viscometer can solve your current andfuture solution viscosity testing needs.
While vast improvements continue to be made in the areas oflaboratory automation, procedures, and workflow, improvements inefficiency and quality seem to be occurring in smaller and smallerincrements. It is as if there were a glass ceiling beyond which nolab can improve. The good news, however, is that this is a falseceiling. What is lacking is an innovative approach and perspectiveon laboratory automation and sample delivery within the lab. Bycombining a fresh approach with the correct technologies, such asRFID, laboratories can again make procedural and automationimprovements that will bring both significant advancements inefficiency and impressive enhancements in quality to thelaboratory. 
Karl Fischer titration remains one of the most widely usedmethods for measuring moisture across many industries. Despite thehigh selectivity of Karl Fischer (KF) reagents toward water, thereare several compounds that react with KF reagents besides water.Evaporators or ovens are typically used to overcomethese shortcomings as well as analyzing difficultsamples such as various solids, powders, polymers, greases, andfatty products. However, such evaporators can only beused manually and  thus they are tedious and time-consuming. For testinglabs with heavy sample workloads, an automated KF-evaporatorsystem would be extremely useful to maximize sample throughput.
In this report, we describe the improvement in the automationof the KF analysis of samples that are both difficult to analyzealong with those with interfering substances. Data from a wide range ofsamples will be presented.
A method has been developed for improved time resolution inonline microdialysis shown in Figure 16. The method was developed for analyzingresponses such as neurotransmitter release that take place within30 minutes. Conventional microdialysis sampling once every 10 or20 minutes is not enough to describe the release accurately.Analysis of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) with 3-minute timeresolution has been achieved. The HPLC system can also be used foranalysis of noradrenalin (NA) together with DA and 5-HT using 2columns with different mobile phase for the analysis of NA. Thesame hardware can also be used for analysis of microdialysatesfrom 3 or 4 animals in parallel. Because only one detector and onepump are used, the system uses a small footprint. Detection limitsimprove with higher injection volume and they are  between20–100 pmole/L for, respectively,10-2 μL injections.
Configurations for parallel analysis. The system on the left is designed for analyzing NA and DA (or DA and 5-HT). The system on the right is designed for analysis of NA, DA, and 5-HT. In that case, two columns are used for NA/DA, and the other two for DA/5-HT.
A method has been developed for multichannel onlinemicrodialysis, which is particularly useful when experiments mustbe replicated for statistical relevance. The method uses threeHPLC columns in parallel integrated in one DECADE IIelectrochemical detector with triple cell control (TCC). Anexample is shown for analysis of serotonin in an onlinemicrodialysis simulation using dialysis probes (Figure 17).
Samples from three online microdialysis experiments are injected simultaneously and analysed in parallel.
In order to assess olfactory nuisances produced by industrial plants (sewage, composting, landfill, petrochemical plants, livestock carcass-quartering sites), reference methods often involve human olfaction.
The electronic nose is a well-established instrument in thelaboratory setting or in quality control where it is used toperform various volatile organic compound (VOC) or aromaanalysis.
 In order to offer continuous and real-time monitoring ofolfactory nuisances, specific sensor array devices have beendeveloped. This small-sized equipment (RQ box as air quality box)includes several complementary sensor arrays in order to detectvolatile chemicals, solvents, and odors with dedicateddatabases.
The network installed in a leading European landfill company will be presented. The results correlated with the standardized method (EN 13725) will be detailed.
This new generation of electronic nose devices dedicated toenvironmental olfactory nuisances is efficiently used forimproving the quality and safety of industrial VOC emissions.
Thanks to real-time measurement ability and wirelesscommunication, these devices can be installed in several areas ofthe same industrial site and generate an accurate map of olfactorynuisance.
Methane (CH4), water vapor (H2O), and carbondioxide (CO2) arecollectively responsible for the majority of the earth'sgreenhouse effects. Robust instrumentation that could measure thesegases with both high accuracy and high precision would reduce theuncertainty in the determination of terrestrial sources and sinksof these dominant greenhouse gases, resulting in improvedpredictive models and a better understanding of the humancontribution to global warming.
Current atmospheric measurement instrumentation has been exposed toproblems related to the dependence of its readings on operatingtemperature and operating pressure. Many need frequent zero andspan calibrations, which requires keeping and maintaining gascylinders with zero air and standard gas mixtures forCO2, and dew pointgenerators for water at each measurement site. In addition, manycannot easily be simultaneously calibrated from site to site tothe level of accuracy required for use in atmospheric inversionstudies.
In this paper, we present results from field trials of a newlyavailable analyzer, based on cavity ring-down technology, capableof performing, in a single instrument, atmospheric inversionmeasurements of CO2,CH4, andH2O. The instrument isdesigned such that it does not require frequent calibration andmaintains high linearity, precision, and accuracy for long periodsof time, over changing environmental conditions, with little or nosample preparation. Deployment of this analyzer could reduceoperating costs and greatly improve the accuracy of greenhouse gasmeasurements, worldwide.
An arsenic speciation study was performed using air filters onwhich total suspended particles (TSPs) were collected from the cityof Huelva, a medium size city with huge industrial influence in SWSpain. Different extraction procedures were performed using water,NH2OH·HCl andH3PO4 solutionswith either microwave or ultrasonic radiation. The optimalextraction procedures were found to be with the use of100 mmolL−1NH2OH·HCland 10 mmolL−1H3PO4 with microwave radiation for 4 minutes. High-performance liquidchromatography coupled with hydride generation and atomicfluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-HG-AFS) was employed for thedetermination of arsenic species. The average extractionefficiency for air filters collected on a monthly basis(n = 12) was found to be 94% and 86% withNH2OH·HCl andH3PO4,respectively. Only inorganic arsenic species (arsenite andarsenate) were detected. The annual mean arsenite and arsenateconcentrations were found to be 1.2 +/−0.3 ngm−3  and 10.4 +/−1.8 ngm−3,  respectively. Arsenatelevels were found to be more variable with maximum concentrationsreaching 30.6 ngm−3.The high level ofarsenic species in the TSP samples can be related to a coppersmelter located in the region.
The detection limit of most ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) isaround 10−6 M. Recently, it wasdiscovered that the detection limit is controlled by minor ionicfluxes, that is, leaching of ions from the membrane into thesample solution. This leaching increases the ion concentration atthe surface of the sensing membrane compared to the sample bulk.Among other approaches, the application of a small galvanostaticcurrent, which eliminates the flux of ions into the sample, hasbeen used to prevent ion leaching and improve the detection limitof ISEs. In this work, a mathematical model is presented todescribe the effect of a constant current on ion-selectivemembranes. From this model, we can predict the time course of themembrane potential and the electric field inside the membranefollowing the application of the current. We can also predict howthe ionophore and ionophore-ion complex concentrations vary withspace and time within the membrane. In Figure 18, a set of concentration profiles are shown,representing the time-dependent concentration polarization of theionophore valinomycin in the cross-section of  a 0.2 mmthick potassium-selective membrane upon the application of5 nA/cm2 current. To confirm the simulatedconcentration profiles, they are compared to experimentalconcentration profiles observed using spectra electrochemicalmicroscopy.
Another application of these simulations is with largercurrents used to characterize the membrane composition. Thechronopotentiometric transients show a characteristic breakpointwhen either the free ionophore or the ionophore complex reacheszero concentration at one of the phase boundaries. The model canpredict when the breakpoint occurs and its dependence on themembrane composition and experimental conditions.
In conclusion, this model provides quantitative description ofthe membrane processes inside an ion-selective membrane whencurrent is applied, and predicts the time required to obtainadequate voltage stability.

The amount of primary fatty acid amides (PFAMs) in a particularmammalian tissue can be determined by using liquid chromatographywith atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry(LC/APCI-MS) for a secondary separation and analysis. Folch-Piextraction done to remove PFAMs from tissue also removes otherclasses of neutral lipids. Because the raw extract is too complexto allow for trace analysis of PFAMs, the extraction is followedby solid phase extraction (SPE) to separate the PFAMs from theother classes. It is impossible to distinguish the position of adouble bond in the PFAMs by just doing one dimension of MS. Soanother separation is needed to individually separate the PFAMsbefore analysis. Standards are used to determine the elutionorder. Detection limits are around 20 fmol. For comparison,a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method haspreviously been developed by Sultana with detection limits around100 fmol. The sample preparation is the same for the GCmethod as the LC/MS except that an extra derivatization step is neededbefore analysis. A variety of mammalian tissues have been analyzedby both methods to determine which PFAMs are present in a varietyof mammalian tissues.

Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) is wellestablished as a highly sensitive instrumental method ideallysuited for heavy metal analysis. In this work, our goal has beenthe development of a miniaturized, battery-powered ASV devicewhich could work unattended and determine, both qualitatively andquantitatively, heavy metals (e.g.,Cd2+,Cu2+,Hg2+,Pb2+) in drinking and wastewaters. In particular, we want to examine the use of modernmicrofabrication techniques in order to optimize the electrodedesign and performance for practical ASV applications.
Our prototype device consists of a flow-through system with ahigh-surface-area microfabricated electrode for metalpreconcentration and downstream electrodes for detection. Thepreconcentrating electrode is fabricated by sputtering a gold film(tantalum underlayer for adhesion)  onto an oxidized siliconwafer which is then patterned photolithographically to provide thedesired shape and dimensions. Subsequently,10–50 μm holes, in varying densities, areetched through the wafer by deep reactive ion etching in order toform a flow-through mesh. Downstream electrodes are created in aseparate operation. Overall, this approach permits convenientcontrol and variation of electrode area, shape and spacing, thesize and density of flow-through channels, and other structuralfeatures to obtain optimum ASV performance. Althoughmicrofabrication procedures are best suited for the formation ofAu or other metallic electrodes, postfabrication modification tomore ideal ASV electrode materials such as Bi or boron-dopeddiamond is possible.

Miniaturization in the field of analytical chemistry continuesto advance measurement capabilities in the biomedical sciences byenlightening our knowledge of complicated biological systems.Novel nanoelectrode fabrication technologies have been developedthat will provide higher-spatial and faster-temporal measurementsof small molecules associated with cellular function,specifically, those involved in neuronal communication. We havedeveloped a method using focused ion beam (FIB) to mill throughinsulating layers of poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) to fabricatenanoelectrode templates. FIB milling is a technique that provides precise spatial control of nanoscale fabrication. Such controlallows for fabrication of single pore electrode templates as wellas multiple pore array templates. Electroless decoration of milledPMMA with gold is used to fabricate several types of nanoelectrodeelements such as inlaid disks, recessed wells, and free-standingwires. Enhancement of spatiotemporal resolution is a direct resultof restricted diffusion and molecular confinement at nanoscaleelectrochemical elements. Pure radial diffusion at eachelectroactive element of fabricated arrays can be achieved byprecise control of spacing, size, and density of nanopores milledin the array template. In situ characterization of these templatesand electrode architectures is performed using SEM imaging.Nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs) and single nanoelectrodes are furtherstudied using cyclic voltammetry and ultra sensitive opticalmicroscopy. Preliminary cyclic voltammograms of singlenanoelectrode template constructs have shown promise forelectrochemical detection at such small scales (Figure 19). Optimization of this systemlends itself to eventual integration into nanofluidic devices andcoupling with lithographic techniques to increase spatial controlfor electrogenerated chemiluminescent events and single-cellhandling and analysis.

Nanometer-scale electronic devices have been proposed andfabricated so far using various nanomaterials. For thecharacterization of signal transport (of electrons, ions, etc.) insuch nanometer-scale devices, a multiple-scanning-probe microscope(MPSPM) which has more than two independently controlled probeswould be a promising tool. In comparison with a normal SPM, thedevelopment of an MPSPM requires many additional functions. One ofthe important functions is to know the positional relationshipbetween the probes on the nanometer scale. This function would beneeded to avoid crashing into each probe and to find thenanostructure which is to be measured. For this purpose, severalapproaches have been reported so far. We have achievedsimultaneous image acquisition by multiple probes and appliedimage recognition to automatically depict the overlapped areasbetween four images. A home-built quadruple-scanning-probetunneling microscope (QSP-TM) which works in air is used forevaluation of the system.
In this presentation, we show recent development of our integrated control system which enables us to know the positional relationship between four probes on a sample surface with simple and easy operation. We have achieved simultaneous imaging on a Pt coated Si surface using multiple probes, and we have applied image recognition functions to automatically visualize the overlapped areas between each image (Figure 20).
Simultaneously measured four STM images using four independent probes. The sample used here was the Pt/Si surface. White arrows indicate some of the characteristic features on the surface.Vtip = −2.0 V, Iref = 300 pA, Scan area: 7800 × 7800 nm.
The last 15 years have seen tremendous advances in theinstrumentation for Raman spectroscopy. Three of these advanceshave been a reduction in the size of instrumentation, an increasein analyzer sensitivity, and the availability of fiber opticprobes for remote analysis. These advances opened the door forprocess measurements using nondestructive, chemically specific,remote Raman spectroscopy. In this presentation, the nextgeneration of developments in Raman analyzers will be discussed.These developments have expanded the applications space for Ramanspectroscopy. Novel process monitoring and control applicationsopportunities relevant to the chemical, polymer, andpharmaceutical industries will be shown.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are carcinogenicpollutants formed in incomplete combustion processes, includingthe burning of fossil fuels. They have been carefully monitored inenvironmental water, air, and soil samples for decades. Lessattention has been paid to the characterization of oxidized PAHderivatives in the environment, primarily because standardanalysis techniques do not have the required sensitivity andselectivity. This paper will present quantitative and sensitiveliquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods for thedetection of benzo[a]pyrene quinones in environmental samples. Itwill discuss complimentary LC/MS/MS experiments that enhance thespecificity of this analytical technique. Figure 21 presents the APCI-MS chromatograph of BaP-1,6-quinone, BaP-3,6-quinone, and BaP-6,12-quinone standards dissolved in methylene chloride obtained using a 70 : 30 methanol: water isocratic eluent transferred through the30°C column at 1.100 mL/min. For this experiment, the APCI head operated in the positive ion mode at 500°C  while applying 6.0 kV to the needle. Chemometrics were employed to determine the optimal operating conditions. The 3-sigma limit of detection of BaP-1,6-quinone is 4 ng/mL, and a linear calibration has been performed over four orders of magnitude. Results for the analysis of BaP-3,6-quinone and BaP-6,12-quinone are comparable. These techniques can be used to elucidate the primary mechanism of BaP photodegradation in complex media, and characterize BaP-quinones in environmental samples. This study can also be used as a foundation for developing quantitative techniques for the characterization of not only other PAH degradation products, but also similar compounds of great significances to environmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications.

Aerosols (small particles suspended in air) play major roles inclimate and the hydrological cycle, as well as on human healtheffects, visibility degradation, and deposition of acids, toxics,and nutrients to ecosystems. Aerosols are also used in materialmanufacturing, nanotechnology, and pharmaceutical drug delivery.The properties and effects of aerosols are strongly dependent onone extensive property (their concentration) and 3 intensiveproperties: size, chemical composition, and physical shape (ormorphology). The measurement of atmospheric aerosols is difficultdue to their inherent complexity, as well as to the largevariability of their properties in space and time. The past decadehas seen the emergence of several methods capable of determiningthe size and chemical composition of aerosol particles inreal time using mass spectrometry. The aerodyne aerosol massspectrometer (AMS) is currently the most widely used instrument ofthis type.
This presentation will focus on four new instrumental and dataanalysis techniques for aerosol field measurements with the AMS.(a) A high mass resolution aerosol mass spectrometer has beendeveloped, which allows for the separation of fragments with thesame integer mass. (b) A thermodenuder (TD) + AMS combination hasbeen developed to obtain correlated volatility-chemistrydetermination. (c) A system for the measurement ofchemically resolved eddy covariance aerosol flux measurements hasbeen developed using the AMS. (d) A factor analysis technique has been developed forcharacterization of the organic aerosol components based on theentire organic mass, rather than on tracers (Figure 22). The basis of thetechnique and its application to the analysis of ambient particlesat multiple urban, rural, and remote locations in the NorthernHemisphere will be discussed.
With advancement in ionization methods and instrumentation, mass spectrometry has become a powerful technology for the characterization of pharmaceuticals. This presentation will give an overview on approaches and strategies for the identification of unknowns in drug substances by mass spectrometry. Examples will include structural analysis of trace-level process impurities in steroid and other bulk drugs, and degradants identifications in degradation studies of drug substances.
As lead compounds are progressed into a regulated manufacturingenvironment, analytical separations must evolve to accuratelytrack the process. In addition to reactants and products, a strongdrug substance method will also monitor the degradation profile ofthe target compound. The generally accepted technique fordetermining the required resolution of a separation involvessubjecting the target compound to aggressive environments to forcethe degradation of the compound. The process of generatingdegraded samples, reducing data, and collating results is time- andlabor-intensive. We have implemented techniques and approachesaimed at softening the personnel resources dedicated to thiswork.
We will demonstrate an automated platform which allows for exposureof compounds in 96-well plates to acid, base, and temperatureconditions. This platform allows for the rapid generation ofsamples in support of this work. The degradation methods aresimple to implement and modify, allowing a wide variety ofconditions to be examined.
Additional advances were made in the data analysis andinterpretation of the separation data. Analysis tools are still inthe early stages but promise great utility. Storage of conditions,retention times, and other useful data in a database allows fordata-driven decisions around separation enhancement. The data alsoprovide a backdrop of information relevant during method transfersto CMO/CROs or during process improvements. These reduce methoddevelopment and qualification hurdles.
We are currently investigating the detection and mapping oflatent fingerprints using micro laser-induced breakdownspectroscopy (MicroLIBS). MicroLIBS utilizes pulse energies of theorder of 100 mJ or less in order to minimize damage to thesurface under investigation and minimize crater size which in turnmaximizes spatial resolution. Latent fingerprints which arise fromthe transfer of skin oils from a fingertip to a surface can beeasily detected by the presence of sodium line emission from saltcontained in the oil. LIBS offers an alternative to thetraditional optical methods (typically fluorescent imaging) usedto detect fingerprints as it directly detects the elementalsignature of the latent fingerprint. Recent work by Lopez-Morenoet al. has demonstrated the possibility of detection of humanfingerprints at a distance of 30 m using 350 mJNd:YAG laser pulses [1].
In the current report, the detection and detailed mapping offingerprints by MicroLIBS are demonstrated using 80microJoule 400 nm and 5 micorJoule266 nm frequency converted Ti: Sapphire laserpulses. 2D imaging of regions of a fingerprint on a Siwafer is demonstrated. The imaging can be carried out by eitherlooking at the sodium emission from the ridges of the fingerprintor the substrate emission signal, silicon in this case, from thevalleys of the fingerprint. The thickness of the latentfingerprint ridges is found to be enough to suppress the lineemission from the Si substrate when using low-energy femtosecondlaser pulses. The emission scaling and optimum conditions forfingerprint detection are under study and will be reported.

It has been demonstrated that within certain accuracy, it ispossible to find the composition of a laser-induced plasma usingcomputational methods and applying no calibration standards. Anumber of manuscripts dedicated to development of absoluteanalysis or so-called “calibration-free” methodshave been published in the past several years. Similar to thepreviously reported works, the model we developed is based on thelocal thermal equilibrium (LTE) assumption and takes plasmatemperature, plasma electron density, as well as thecharacteristics of atomic emission transitions as main inputparameters. Using these parameters, we model the plasma emissionspectra and predict the sample composition using a proposedcalibration-free algorithm. 
The model uses an atomic emission lines database to create a theoretical emission spectrum of selected elements for defined plasma parameters. The resulting theoretical spectrum is fitted to the experimental spectrum, which is obtained using the plasma emission signal collected by four separate compact spectrometers providing the spectral coverage of 185–950 nm. A calibrated light source is used to correct the experimental data for different spectrometer grating efficiencies, nonlinear CCD responses, and differences in the collecting optics. Elemental concentrations are obtained via the comparison of the observed and predicted spectra, the best fit being obtained by varying the essential plasma parameters.
Plasmas are very efficient excitation sources for atomicspectroscopy. The microwave-induced plasma (MIP) sources can becoupled to gas chromatography (GC) quite easily. While aninductively coupled plasma (ICP) consumes about 15 L/minof the noble gas argon, the MIP is operated with only200 mL/min helium. Therefore, hyphenation of an MIP with aGC constitutes an efficient tool for speciation analysis.
The GC-MIP system presented allows for the quick analysis of mercury species in food samples. During sample preparation, mercury species are converted into volatile compounds via derivatization with NaBEt4. The separation of the species is achieved with a 100% dimethyl polysiloxane GC column, followed by the detection in the MIP. The emitted light is selected by an interference filter which is oscillating in the light path between the plasma and the photo diode. Transmitting only a small section around the mercury emission line at 253.652 nm, this filter's main characteristic is that tilting it towards incoming radiation results in a shift of the transmission profile to lower wavelengths. With the oscillation of the filter and a modulated signal readout, a suitable background correction is possible.
The presented data show that selective and sensitive detectionof mercury species in food samples can be realized with thissystem.  The detection limit reaches downto 1 pg absolute in combination with a selectivity ofmercury against carbon exceeding106.
In spite of the versatility of a number of functionalizedpolymeric sorbents for furnishing clean extracts during solidphase extraction- (SPE-) based purification/enrichment ofpharmaceuticals from plasma and other biological matrices inhigh-throughput environments, method development for samplepreparation still retains a bottleneck. This is due to thetedious and time-consuming process of screening several sorbentsindividually, since very few formats with multiple sorbents packedin the same well plate are available. Additionally, each sorbenthas its own optimized load, wash, and elution profile and not manyreported procedures are available for using a common procedure forscreening all sorbents.
In this presentation, we describe a protocol that can be usedto screen multiple sorbents simultaneously, using a recentlyintroduced 96-well method development plate. This new product ispacked with four polymeric sorbents of divergent surfacechemistries, namely, a neutral polar functionalized polymer strata-X,a strong cation exchanger strata-X-C, a weak cation exchangerstrata-X-CW, and a weak anion exchanger strata-X-AW. All thesorbents are poly[stryrene-divinylbenzene]-based. A novel protocolis used to simultaneously evaluate all the sorbents under multipleconditions and pinpoint the one set most suitable for a particularpharmaceutical compound. The protocol also enables theoptimization of the load, wash and elution conditions for neutral,acidic, or basic analytes of a wide range of polarities. Severalexamples of the solid phase extraction of polar and nonpolarantibiotics, antihypertensives, nonsteroidal antiinflammatorydrugs, and antipsychotics from human plasma will be presented toillustrate the applicability of this rapid automated screeningtechnique using MultiPROBE II liquid handling system.
Four rapid, automated methods are used to analyze volatileflavor compounds in a variety of food and food ingredients. Themethods include membrane-assisted solvent extraction (MASE), solidphase microextraction (SPME), solid phase dynamic extraction(SPDE), and in-tube extraction (ITEX). Foods analyzed includerice, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, coffee, chocolate, pepper sauce,carbonated beverage, milk, orange juice, off-flavor sugar, and anartificial punch flavored beverage. A mixture of chemicals with arange of polarities is analyzed to demonstrate how differenttrapping materials are required to optimize the analysis ofdifferent materials.
All four methods are simple in terms of sample preparation. Inall cases, samples are sealed in vials and loaded on anautosampler.
The limits of detection, coefficients of variation, cost peranalysis, and linear range for each method are reported and relatedto the physics and chemistry of each method. For example, due tothe larger amount of stationary phase in an SPDE needle as comparedto an SPME fiber, SPDE traps more volatile compounds from theheadspace (Figure 23) andtherefore it has a lower limit of detection. Finally, parameters foreach method are optimized for the analysis of each of the above-mentioned foods.

Enantiomers differ in three-dimensional conformation. The bodycan readily distinguish among isomers. Enantiomers can differmarkedly in their pharmacokinetics, therapeutic efficiency,toxicology, and biological properties.
The FDA has actively encouraged the pharmaceutical industry topursue enantiopure chiral drugs whenever possible. Significanttime and resources are invested in their production. Currenttechnology is costly and cumbersome as each chiral separationrequires a great deal of process development. Single enantiomerdrugs are so difficult to produce in quantity that only 500 existout of the nearly 16 000 regulated pharmaceuticals. A uniquewindow into chiral phenomena based on physical mechanisms ratherthan chemical interactions has been incorporated into aproprietary nanostructured “smart materials”providing unusual chiral properties. This revolutionary chiralmedium based on physical chiral mechanisms offers a new anddifferent approach to the challenges of chiral chromatographyacting as a universal chiral selector. Incorporation of thisunique chiral discriminator into solid phase extraction cartridgesoffers an extremely efficient and unprecedented performance.This dramatically reduces the time and cost of bringing new drugs tomarket. This simplistic approach offers the same separationsobserved in HPLC chiral chromatography and eliminates therequirements for a chiral detector. The automated solid phaseextraction system allows multiple isomeric compounds to beseparated in parallel at a fraction of time associated withanalytical chiral chromatography. The “smartmaterial” within an SPE cartridge is also being evaluatedas a reusable medium which may offer an unprecedented approach tochiral separations.
Adenosine is a ubiquitous signaling nucleoside that is rapidlygenerated as a net result of ATP (adenosine triphosphate)catabolism that occurs in situations of cellular stress or damage.Once generated, adenosine can influence a diverse array ofcellular functions by engaging cell-surface adenosine receptors.The expression of these receptors is widely distributed amongtissues, and this signaling pathway has been implicated to exertimportant physiological effects in the cardiovascular,neurological, renal, and immune systems. The complexity associatedwith adenosine metabolism and signaling makes the examination ofits functions critical. Adenosine has been implicated to play arole in inflammatory lung disease such as asthma and chronicobstructive pulmonary disease. To investigate all of the above importantroles of adenosine in the system, a reliable analytical method mustbe available to measure adenosine.
An effective HPLC method was developed and validated todetermine adenosine in biological samples using Agilent 1100 HPLCsystem. A reversed-phase mode with a UV-detector at 254 nmand Supelco Discovery C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm,5 m) was used. A gradient elution with a gradient time of40 minutes and two segments, from 7–20% and20–85% MeOH/buffer at pH 3.80 with 25 mMpotassium dihydrogen phosphate, were found as the optimum conditions.These conditions resulted in a retention time of 13.3 minutes foradenosine.
The developed method showed a linear detector response withconcentration of adenosine, with a correlation coefficient of 0.999and a detection limit of 25 μg/L. Results ofvalidation studies show that the developed method is specific,accurate, robust, and precise.
A fluorescent turn-off assay for phospholipase C (PLC) fromClostridium perfringens is developed based on the traceableinteraction between natural substrate, phosphatidylcholine, andPPE-type conjugated polymer with sulfate side group. The polymerfluorescence response to the effect of phosphatidylcholine iscalibrated first and served as a basis to monitor the activity ofthe enzyme. The assay applies to micromolar regime ofconcentrations of substrate and offers a simple, fast, and reliabledetection method to PLC with high sensitivity. Reaction rates andkinetic parameters are measured in real time by convertingfluorescence signals of polymer to substrate concentrations.Activation and inhibition of enzyme activity are investigated.Good selectivity is obtained by testing the activity of PLC andfive controls in the same assay, respectively, which demonstratesthat the specific effect between substrate and enzyme is thedominant interaction.
The determination of mercury in fresh- and saltwater specieshas become a primary focal point of both private and publicinstitutions. These organizations make important regulatory andscientific decisions dependent upon the mercury levels found infish tissue and, therefore, require a rapid, accurate method formercury determination. Traditionally, cold vapor atomic absorptionspectrophotometry (CVAAS) has been used to measure mercury levelsin fish. Although effective, this technique is a time- andlabor-consuming method that relies on complicated wet chemistrysample preparation. In contrast, the mercury levels determinedhere were collected using Milestone Inc.'s DMA-80 (directmercury analyzer). This instrument directly analyzes a sample viathermal decomposition and subsequent conversion of mercury to itselemental state by means of catalytic reduction. The total mercuryin the sample is then measured by a dual-cell atomic absorptionspectrophotometer with total analysis time of approximately sixminutes. Our results indicate that the DMA-80 is both  accurateand precise method for determining mercury concentrations in fishtissue. In addition, the results appear to be more precise thantraditional CVAAS techniques.
Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis continues to grow as theanalytical method of choice for pharmaceutical applications,including clean-in-place validation, Water for injection, purifiedwater, and other critical purposes. The significant nature ofthese applications requires data validation using validationsamples, spiked samples, and other techniques. System validationhas become as important as the analyses themselves. Theseadditional requirements place a heavy burden on the analyst andorganization to monitor the devices for compliance.
This paper details system automation designed for validationmonitoring of TOC measurements. Features include the ability tomonitor calibration performance, verify compliance with userspecified parameters, evaluate validation samples for accuraterecovery, perform automatic system suitability tests, assessquality-control standards, perform verification through anIQ/OQ/PQ, and so forth. Additional elements include the capacityto meet compliance requirements for 21 CFR Part 11, as well asother regulatory guidelines. Automation of these steps frees theanalyst to perform other duties while the instrument processsamples, and protects the data and samples from instrumentmalfunction through its automated capability to verify user-defined pass/fail criteria.
An LC/MS method will be presented for the screening of over 120deleterious organic compounds in drinking water supplies. MS/CIDand MS/MS libraries were created using a tandem mass spectrometerand MassLynxÔ software and subsequently converted to NISTformat using the ChromaLynxÔ application manager. Sampleswere analyzed using an LC/MS full scan method with data collectedat multiple cone voltages. The ChromaLynx application manger wasused to automatically deconvolute chromatograms to identify samplecomponents and search against the MS/CID library. The use ofChromaLynx eliminates the time-consuming task of manuallyprocessing the chromatographic and spectral data, searching thelibrary and creating a list of tentative analytes. In addition,ChromaLynx has the ability to locate components in the samplewhich could be missed in a manual review due to close orcoeluting components and to filter using retention time,ionization polarity, and cone voltage information.
Additional identification of sample components was carried out by LC/MS/MS. This analysis consisted of a product ion scan function for each of the components on the match list produced from the LC/MS analysis. ChromaLynx was again used to identify individual components and perform a search of the MS/MS library. Final confirmation of sample components was carried out by LC/MS/MS MRM analysis with TargetLynxÔ processing.
The widespread acceptance and increased use of nutritional supplements can be seen as the sale of natural supplements worldwide increased from $8 billion in 1995 to $19 billion in 2000[1].The speciation of metals in dietary supplements can be used as a fingerprint to the source of contamination of toxic heavy metals such as arsenic. The species-dependent toxicity of arsenicals requires analytical techniques capable of distinguishing the toxic (inorganic arsenic) from the nontoxic (organic arsenic) chemical forms [2].The main limitations with atomic spectroscopy methods, however, are that they are only compatible to aqueous solvents and lack structural information about the detected compounds. At this point, one would desire an analytical technique that could provide structural, fragmentation, and elemental information (termed as comprehensive speciation) by using a single mass spectrometry ion source.
A simple isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed to separate inorganic and organic arsenic compounds (As(III) chloride, arsenobetaine (AB), and dimethyl arsenic acid (DMA)) on a C18 column with a mobile phase composition of water: methanol (96 : 4). The eluted species were detected using a particlebeam-electron ionization mass spectrometry (PB-EIMS) that canprovide species-specific information. The flow was optimized at0.7 mL min−1. The addition of0.1% (v/v) TFA improved the resolution of the mixture andthe separation was accomplished in less than 7 minutesDetection limits for As(III), DMA, and AB were found to be 0.13,0.16, and 0.3 ng absolutes in the SIM mode and 0.27, 0.41,and 0.11 ng absolutes in the TIC mode, respectively.Subsequently, this method was applied to ethanolic kelp extracts,where the inorganic and organic arsenic species were separated andidentified. These studies revealed that the majority of thearsenic (80–90%) is present in the tested kelpsample in the form of inorganic arsenic. Very minor amounts werepresent in the form of DMA (5–10% of the totalAs). There was no detectable level of AB. The total arseniccontent in the ethanolic extract was determined by ICP-OES andvalidated by analyzing NIST SRM 3242 ephedra.
A typical drug requires 12 years of research and development to bring it to market. A critical step in the latter stages of development is human clinical trials to study pharmacokinetics and efficacy. This step represents a significant barrier in that there is a limited number of willing test patients. Patients must not only endure multiple withdrawals of blood, but also run the risk of adverse side effects, anemia, and possible HIV contamination. Saliva analysis has long been considered an attractive alternative to blood, but current methods involving extensive sample extraction followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry typically require 10–20 cc per analysis. In an effort to overcome this limitation, we have been developing lab-on-a-chip devices to both separate drugs and their metabolites from saliva and generate surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS). We have incorporated standard chromatography materials to aid separation, as well as a porous material containing metal particles that generate SERS. Generally, no more than a drop of sample is required and complete analysis can be performed in 5 minutes. The detailed molecular vibrational information allows chemical identification, while the increase in Raman scattering by six or more orders of magnitude allows detection of nanomolar concentrations. Measurements of basic drugs, drugs of abuse, and chemotherapy drugs will be presented.
The first and essential step in controlling and mitigating airpollution is to quantify emissions of air pollution. The mostimportant cause for air pollution in cities is urban traffic. Inthis situation, it is important to be able to monitor airpollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, particulatematter, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds, emitted byroad traffic. Presently, in many Polish cities only fixedmonitoring stations are installed, which measure the content ofbasic air pollutants in urban air. The measurement of airpollution alongside of communication lanes is very rare.
The paper presents the concept of a mobile monitoring system for main air pollutants in the cities. The novelty of the proposed system is connected with the fact that it can be used to monitor emissions from urban traffic along roads and those areas, where traditional monitoring stations cannot be placed.
In the proposed system, a mobile station may be attached toprivate cars, buses, trucks, and so forth. Stations in this systemare small, portable structures and contain an electronicinstrument used to measure, record, and transmit the concentrationof various pollutants to the website. Weather conditions, such astemperature, and humidity are also measured. The proposed stationshould be cheap, reliable,  requiring no frequent routinemaintenance procedures like calibration, filter changes, and soforth.
The mobile monitoring system can determine representative airpollution in highly populated areas, the impact of communicationsources of pollution, general background pollution levels directlyaffected by cars, and the highest pollution levels in thecities.
The proposed mobile monitoring system is a unique solution not only in Poland but also in the European Union.
The cold on-column injector is widely considered, the most accurate and precise injection system, being able to ensure the preservation of sample integrity. Additionally, when manually operated, on-column injection has the important feature of being septumless and consequently free of contamination due to septum bleed. This work presents the capabilities of a newly designed septumless on-column injector in combination with a robotic autosampler (TriPlus, Thermo Electron) that allows to extend this feature to an automatic system. The injector, along with special sample vial closures and  a solenoid-valves-based syringe washing station, avoids any contact between sample and silicon septa, preventing any siloxane interfering peaks.
Performances of this system are illustrated through typicalon-column applications such as triglycerides analysis and SimDistcharacterization of petroleum fractions. Analysis of real foodsamples such as edible oils and their triglyceridescharacterization is also presented. These applications areproblematical when using hot injectors since samplediscrimination, during sample transfer from the needle into theinjector and from the injector into the column, may produceunreliable chromatograms and subsequent quantitations.
A method based on headspace solid phase microextraction(HS-SPME with gas chromatography and pulsedflame photometric detection (GC-PFPD)) has been investigated forsimultaneous determination of monobutyltin MBT, dibutyltin DBT, andtributyltin TBT. The effects of pressure and presence of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) during HS-SPME sampling were evaluated usingmodified 50 mL conical flasks and magnetic stirring at roomtemperature. The coated phase used in thisstudy was polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS, 100 μm). Theoptimal pressure was 0.3 bar, obtaining increasings of 30%, 39%and 50% on the extraction yield of MBT, DBT, and TBT,respectively. The extraction and preconcentration steps at thispressure were optimized by experimental design methodology. Thescreening step showed that three variables were significantssample volume, agitation time, and DMSO concentration. Theoptimized values are 15 mL, 25 minutes, and 33%(v/v), respectively. Agitation time was lower than  applied atnormal pressure (40 minutes). A comparison of the extractionyield using fibers with different stationary phases (PDMS/DVB65 μm, CAR/PDMS 75 μm, DVB/CAR/PDMS50/30 μm) showed that the optimal fiber for MBT andDBT extractions was the PDMS fiber and for TBT was the DVB/CAR/PDMSfiber. The analytical performances determined by using standardsolutions and triproyltin as internal standard were linearityrange LOQ-80 ng Sn and detection limits for MBT0.1 ng Sn and for DBT and TBT 0.03 ng Sn.Sensitivities were three times higher than those obtained at 1 bar and40 minutes of agitation. Repeatability RSD (%) rangedbetween 15% and 0.2% for solutions of 2 to 75 ngSn. This methodology was applied to the analysis of Chilean fishsamples.

A novel in-needle sample preparation device was developed inthis work, which is designed for the GC analysis of aldehydes andketones commonly found in typical in-house environments.Simultaneous derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)was made during the sampling process of the gaseous sample, andthe derivatized analytes were desorbed by passing a small amountof organic solvent through the extraction needle in the heated GCinjection port. The reproducible preparation of the extractionneedle was established along with the repeatablederivatization/extraction that ensures the successfuldetermination of aldehydes. Basic extraction performance of thefiber-packed extraction needle has been evaluated along with theoptimization of several experimental parameters on thederivatization, extraction, and desorption. Taking into account theapplications including the in-house environment analysis, thestorage power of the needle device for the extracted analytesunder the room temperature was also studied. The resultsdemonstrated the successful applications of the fiber-packedextraction device for the sample preparation of gaseous sample ofaldehydes, and the future possibility of the extraction device forthe analysis of in-house environments.
 Why an alternative to standard  MicroGCsoftware? Standard chromatographic software is notadapted to MicroGC specificity. MicroGC is more and more used formonitoring application and the software has to provide specificfeatures in accordance with MicroGC technique.

The analysis of Flavors and Fragrances in complexmatrices is one of the ideal applications where it is possible totake advantage of the unprecedented separation power delivered bycomprehensive 2DGC. Several papers presented over the last decadehave explored the capability of this innovative technique toprovide target components analysis as well as detailedcharacterization of flavors in various types of beverages.
This work relates to the coupling of comprehensive 2DGC withSPME for this type of analysis, fully automated by the TriPlusautosampler (Thermo Electron) on the TRACE GCxGC equipment (ThermoElectron), managed through a dedicated data system (Hyperchrom,Thermo Electron).
Several examples of analysis of various beverages, bothalcoholic and nonalcoholic, allow to appreciate the advantages ofthe enormous chromatographic separation together with thesimplicity of the solventless sample preparation technique applied.
On top, the mechanism of agitation, specifically developed on the TriPlus autosampler in order to reduce the mechanical stress on the SPME fiber, allows to significantly extend the average lifetime of standard fused silica fibers. The presented data show that long sequences of samples can be run using the same fiber, further expanding the productivity of the whole analytical cycle.
The toxic effect of chlorinated hydrocarbons has been wellknown and characterized for many years. In order to determinewhether airborne concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons willhave an adverse effect, precise measurements have to be taken atmany remote points to get a representative picture. This isparticularly true in urban and large industrial environments.
Devices have been developed to measure chlorinated hydrocarbonsat low PPB levels but none has been really optimized for remotemonitoring. Those devices have been typically designed for use inthe laboratory and present some formidable limitations when usedin remote locations. Some of the key limitations include lack oflong-term stability (PID), high maintenance costs (GC/MS and tosome extent GC/FID), or large physical size and weight. SomeIR-based devices are used in remote locations but, unfortunately,require a long measurement path length and cannot be used duringinclement weather.
To address these limitations, preconcentrator/sampleenrichment device, MEM-based chromatograph (Micro GC PRO),differential mobility detector (DMD), and high-resolution capillarycolumn were combined in a system optimized for the measurement ofchlorinated hydrocarbons in remote nonlaboratory environments.The system can selectively measure components at low PPB levels.The on-board signal processing, peak integration, and dataprocessing capability of the Micro GC PRO provide highly accurateand repeatable BTX measurements in remote locations without theneed for skilled operators.
Details from a study commissioned to validate the system for remote measurements of chlorinated hydrocarbons at low ppb levels will be presented and discussed.
The declaration of trans fat content is now required on foodlabels in the US. Trans fat content is expressed on a per servingbasis and is calculated by adding the content of all fatty acidshaving at least one nonconjugated trans double bond. Fatty acidsanalysis is generally achieved by gas chromatography using long(100 m) polar capillary columns such as Supelco SP 2560,Varian CP-Sil 88, or Agilent HP-88. In order to properly reporttrans fat content, analysts are required to enhance the existingmethods of analysis by optimizing fatty acid separation,increasing the number of fatty acids analyzed, and investigatinganalytes present at low concentrations. None of the officialmethods of analysis for routine quantitation of fatty acids infoods currently includes any information regarding limits ofdetection and quantitation. In the current work, we are addressingcritical aspects of trans fatty acids quantitation in order toobtain more accurate values for total trans fat content.Comparisons among separations achieved using different GC columnsand lower quantifiable values for trans fatty acids will bediscussed.
Much recent emphasis has been placed on making major reductionsin particle size to significantly improve HPLC performance at theexpense of pressure; however, such extreme measures are seldompractical for the industry to absorb quickly. In the meantime,workhorse HPLC columns for the industry are still madepredominantly with 5 μm and 3 μmparticles. Too little has been done to evaluate the gains that canbe achieved by the important step of moving applications from5 μm to 3 μm particles. The design andperformance of 3 μm particles will be compared toother smaller particles in short column formats. While silica isthe most common and useful substrate today, the benefits of othersubstrate platforms will also be reviewed.
Choosing a substrate with the right particle size is not theonly important step in optimizing separation speed. Pore size,pore structure, stationary phase chemistry, and column hardware allplay an important role in determining separation performance,sample throughput, and column lifetime. Column performance will becompared under both isocratic and gradient conditions in order tojudge the true value of various particle sizes and bonded phasesunder practical use conditions. High-speed LC-UV and LC-MSapplications will be shown for various columns and particle sizesusing both conventional LC systems having 400 bar pressure limitsand new LC systems having 1000 bar pressure limits. The practicallimits of what separation speeds can be achieved today withconventional LC systems and columns prepared with3 μm particles will be clearly demonstrated. Thepotential limits of what speeds might be achievable with new LCsystems and smaller particle technology will be explored.
The new technique crystallization elution fractionation, whichcombines TREF and CRYSTAF, results in a very fast analysis timethat can be used successfully in the high-throughput analysis of thechemical composition distribution. A new compact and robustequipment has been built to analyze 50 samples/day in a fullyautomated mode with very low solvent consumption. The easyincorporation of a viscometer and/or light scattering detectorsprovides additionally molar mass composition interdependenceinformation.
Aggregate formation is an important concern in thepurification, formulation, and storage of protein therapeutics.The integrity of protein preparations is often monitored by HPLCusing UV and RI detection. However, the characterization ofaggregates present at very low levels poses a significantchallenge to current HPLC technology. For many cases, the proteinsamples are separated by HPLC to determine the trace of variouscomponents such as monomer, dimmer, and aggregates (multimers). Itis a very time-costly process and almost impossible to predictwithout running HPLC. Therefore, there is a need to develop amodel or method to screen the formulations in a time-efficientway. The virial coefficient is often used to determine theinteractions between protein molecules and their interaction withthe solvent molecules, which is usually performed by static lightscattering (SLS) detectors and tells about the repulsive or attractiveinteractions between protein molecules and solvent molecules.Light scattering can be used as a highly informative tool todetermine the second virial coefficient for an extensivedetermination of the different types of aggregates. This ishelpful in a faster selection of a favorable formulation andtherefore can be used as a fast screening technique without theneed of conducting an accelerated stability study for the purposeof formulation development.
Flow injection methods for low-level determination of totalphosphate, total cyanide, and distilled phenol have beendeveloped. All three methods can be quantitated to 2 ppb.These methods are all fully automated and require no samplepreparation. We have also developed an anionic surfactants methodthat can quantitate to 10 ppb sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)and 25 ppb linear alkyl sulfonate (LAS) without samplepreparation or extraction. Because these are high-throughputmethods (>12 samples per hour) and no sample preparationis required, these methods can save hours of time a day whencompared to manual methods.
Developing HPLC methods for complex mixtures of chemicals orpharmaceuticals is a time-consuming and knowledge-intensive task.This task can be especially challenging when dealing withhigh-throughput analysis required from synthesis of libraries ofcompounds, where instead of designing an HPLC method for a singlesample, HPLC methods are needed for single and multiple plates,each containing up to 96 samples. Sometimes, there are similarstructures between the samples on a plate, and at other times eachsample contains unique compounds from different syntheticchemistry laboratories.
 When physical property data are available for the compoundssuch as various pKa data, logD values at different pHs, solubilityinformation, structural information, and molecular stability, thesamples can be classified to determine a priori which HPLC methodsshould provide reasonable separation. The expert knowledge used toperform this classification involved, creating detailed paper-basedor Microsoft Visio-based decision trees, which were then automatedwith software. We refer to this as automated“pre-preparative analysis.”
The next task involves running and analyzing the results of thepredicted HPLC methods for each sample on the actual HPLCequipment. In some cases, the results can be easily scaled tosubsequent preparative separation and in other cases, the resultsindicate that further HPLC method development is required. Again,the expert decision making is taken from static diagrams toreal-time, online software automation. This presentation will showpractical examples of how software decision trees wereincorporated into a walk-up/open access system for multisample,pre-preparative analysis, rapid method development, andpreparative separation.
Stability and formulation testing can be a lengthy and laborintensive process if each test is performed individually. Thesetests normally involve multiple sample preparation, extractionsolvent preparation, and dissolution media preparation. Analternative approach is to utilize the dissolution test to acquireall data required for stability and formulation testing. Thisposter will present the methods used and data acquired includingimplementation and validation of simultaneous determination ofdissolution rate, assay, content uniformity, identification, andrelated compounds using a Waters 2695D HPLC system.
In recent years, online SPE-LC has gained popularity as analternative to manual pretreatment of complex samples such asblood, plasma, and urine. A dedicated system for this approachcomprises two gradient pumps in one enclosure, a column switchingvalve, and a powerful software solution for easy setup andoperation.
A dedicated SPE-column as an integral part of the totalanalysis system is mandatory for a bioanalytical online SPE-LCsystem. It has to repeatedly deplete the matrix withoutunselective accumulation of matrix components and allow targetanalyte(s) extraction with unchanged selectivity/capacity despitemultiple uses. The so-called restricted access materials (RAMs)fulfil these requirements [1].
Online SPE-LC with 4 mm ID SPE-column used in connection with 4–4.6 mm ID HPLC columns requires injection volumes of up to 500 μL in order to achieve appropriate limits of quantitation. Biofluid samples are limited in volume and must often serve for several diagnostic determinations. In addition, the flow rates on these column dimensions are not ideal for electrospray MS.
We present a novel, miniaturized (20 × 1 mm IDRAM SPE-column and 50 × 2.1 ID mm analytical column),online SPE-LC solution for rugged and reliable analysis of drugsin biofluids. This reduces cycle time 2-fold, solvent consumption8-fold, and injection volume 5-fold compared to common onlineSPE-LC. Overall, the sensitivity is enhanced approximately8-fold.
As an application, we show the fully automated analysis of antimycotic drugs in human plasma.
Online SPE-LC is used for convenient, fully automated samplepreparation of complex samples combined with inline separation anddetection of the target analytes. During online SPE-LC methoddevelopment, several partial procedures like matrix elution time(tM), analyte breakthrough time(tA), and analyte transfer time(tT) have to be coordinated. Based onthese parameters, the correct valve switching times must bedefined. In addition, two gradient control programs need to becreated. These requirements represent a barrier for users andtherefore need to be overcome to allow for a broader adoption of thispowerful technique.
This poster shows how this barrier can be removed by anintelligent software solution. The software approach uses a wizardwhich calculates from method-dependent user input (e.g.,tM, tA,and tT) appropriate column switchingtimes, and then generates a suitable instrument methodaccordingly.

Microwave-assisted solvent extraction techniques have become accepted as a rapid and low solvent use “green” technology. Pressurizing the extraction solvent allows temperatures to be achieved in excess of the atmospheric boiling point and thus increases the rate of partition of the analyte into the liquid phase. Of course, care must be taken to ensure that the temperature is not sufficient to degrade the analyte of interest.
This paper will introduce a novel approach to automation inmicrowave-assisted solvent extraction. A semiopen focusedmicrowave system will be shown to offer significant advantages interms of extraction time, ease of use, and flexibility.
Analytical data will be presented for solvent extractions ofpolymers and plastics for environmentally important additives.Enhanced flexibility and ease of use will be demonstrated alongwith low solvent usage. This novel, sequential sample processinginstrument can rapidly extract up to 96 samples with each sampleunder full temperature and pressure control. A comparison will bemade of extraction efficiency for samples that are stirred andunstirred and a range of sample sizes to extract solvent volumeratios studied. Results will be presented which show a significantsaving in time and solvent volume for extractions of thistype.
Solid phase extraction (SPE) has revolutionized samplepreparation methodology for diverse sample types. In many cases,variations on the technique offer enhanced recovery, greateropportunity for speciation, and a reduction in solvent and sampleconsumption. Unlike solvent extraction, SPE is generally easy toautomate for offline use. The simple adaptation of SPE for onlineuse has not been as successful as its uptake for offlineapplications.
Recognizing that the primary purpose of most SPE methods issolvent exchange (e.g., the extraction of an aqueous sample for GCinlet) or some form of matrix cleanup (e.g., desalting or removalof endogenous materials), the further development of SPE foronline use becomes a directed exercise. Miniaturization of SPE intothe sample injection system allows for a much smaller portion of thesample to be extracted and for the whole of the extract to beinjected onto the chromatographic column for separation. In manycases, such an approach allows the same level of sampleconcentration to be achieved as  possible with offlineconventional SPE. Providing the miniaturization does not approachthe same scale as the pseudoplates of the sorbent; micro-SPE maybe readily adapted from established SPE methods. 
Using simple applications, we demonstrate the usefulness ofmicro-SPE for different combinations of sample type and sorbentchemistry prior to analysis by GC or LC techniques.
The micro-SPE apparatus is suitable for online use in GC, HPLC,and for sample preparation prior to other analytical techniquesincluding immunoassay and offline nondestructive spectroscopicanalysis by NMR, IR, and other methods.
Pressurized microwave digestion technology has become widelyaccepted as a rapid and convenient method of sample preparationfor metals. However, the nature of microwave interaction with theacid/sample matrix forces analysts with widely varying samples torun small batches of similar samples. Recent advances inhigh-throughput technology have increased batch size but they have notaddressed the fundamental issue of control of this batchprocess.
This paper outlines a new sequential approach using a novel semi-open focused technology to this problem for analytes with samples of widely varying type requiring widely varying methodology.
Novel focused, semiopen, microwave instrumentation is presentedwith an inbuilt control network allowing sequential processing ofmultiple samples requiring multiple reagents and methodologies. Anautomated control system allows a sample weight to vessel volumeratio far in excess of any previous technology, reducing reagentuse and maximizing analyte concentration. Results will bepresented demonstrating the use of the equipment for totaldigestion or dissolution of reference materials, at elevatedpressures and temperatures for multiple samples automatically, insequence under multiple sets of reagents and conditions.Additionally, one organic reference material (TORT-2) will bepresented, digested with the same methodology, over an extremelywide sample size range illustrating the improvement insample-to-volume ratio accomplished over traditional microwavebatch systems.
Rapid method development is the most sought after segment ofsample preparation during the analysis of pharmaceuticals frombiological matrices, especially in performing analysis of ADME(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) samplesduring new drug development. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is thepreferred technique for processing high volumes of samples due toits amenability for automation and its ability to concentratesubnanogram level analytes while simultaneously delivering cleanextracts. The major obstacle to the use of SPE for this type ofhigh-throughput analysis is determining the most suitable sorbentand extraction conditions for a particular analyte. Screeningsorbents individually for optimal recovery and cleanliness aretime-consuming and tedious.
In this communication, we present a simplified, neverthelessexhaustive approach to optimizing the sorbent and conditions forthe SPE of analytes from biological matrices. Using a MULTIPROBEII automated liquid handling system and a recently released96-well polymeric method development plate, we developed auniversal screening protocol for defining the sorbent andconditions for SPE in less than one hour. The 96-well platecontained four polymeric sorbents of divergent surface chemistry,which cover hydrophobic, polar and ion exchangeinteractions between them. Using carbamazepine as a neutral probe, atenolol,metoprolol, and promethazine as representatives of polar andhydrophobic basic probes, and indomethacin as an example of acidicprobes, we demonstrate that the universal protocol can cater toall kinds of analytes in furnishing optimal conditions for thesolid phase extraction from any biological matrix. 
Ingredients with high concentration of omega 3 areincreasingly used in the food and beverage industry. However, this ingredient can bring an undesirable odor/aroma to the final product.
Consequently, it is cosidered to be of  upmost importance for both omega-3 manufacturers and users to monitor the organoleptic features of this additive.
Usually, food ingredients are evaluated by human sensory panels, which can be unpleasant and time-consuming.
An electronic nose based on gas sensors arrays, the FOX instrument, has been used to assess Omega 3 sensory quality and to perform aging studies.
Analyzed omega-3 powder addressed to infants included samples at 2 different times: t = 0 (freshly produced) and t = 2 months under various storage conditions (air or nitrogen).
Those samples were assessed by sensory panel (scoring scale between 1 and 2) and analyzed with the FOX electronic nose.
It results in a clear discrimination between samples used ascontrol Omega 3 powder and samples to be analyzed and a cleardifferentiation of samples according to storage conditions.
After building a calibration curve with the FOX electronic nose, the model showed a good correlation with sensory panel scores (correlation coefficient > 99%) and allowed to predict unknown powders scores.
The FOX electronic nose can bring about the ability to screen a large number of samples to check their quality. Thus companies can reduce time and costs of analysis chain process, and significantly improve the product-quality consistency.
Enterochromaffin (EC) cells play a key role within the enteric nervous system. EC cells function as sensory transducers that respond to mechanical or chemical stimulation of the mucosa by releasing serotonin. Serotonin then acts on mucosal endings of enteric primary afferent neurons and extrinsic primary afferent neurons to initiate motor reflexes and intestinal sensation. Development of stable and reliable techniques for measurement of serotonin would be of great value in understanding the normal physiology of EC cells and their contribution to control of gastrointestinal function and visceral perception.
Serotonin is easily oxidized and thus can be detected usingelectrochemical methods. However, a major complication with stabledetection of serotonin in vitro or in vivo is the rapid electrodefouling that occurs caused by adsorbed reaction products. Toovercome this problem, we have used boron-doped diamond (BDD)microelectrodes which help to overcome fouling effects compared toconventionally used carbon fiber microelectrodes.
We have used amperometry detection at +700 mV versusAg—AgCl for the in vitro detection of serotonin from ECcells, where we show that BDD microelectrode hasmuch better suited such measurements compared to carbon fibermicroelectrodes. We will show how various different stimulus(chemical, electrical, and mechanical) affect the amount ofserotonin release and its possible physiological meaning. Wewill also show a study of how responses are varied from neonatal toadult animals, which will have implications on studying how stagesof development could alter gut mobility. 
Diabetes has been a major health concern due to the constantlyincreasing number of affected people worldwide. Diabetes accountsfor nearly 17 million patients in the United States alone.Diabetes, if untreated, will cause slow deterioration of heart,kidneys, eyes, feet and skin, nerves, teeth, and gums. Bloodglucose has been the most reliable indicator of the onset ofdiabetes. However, it is of interest to develop earlier indicatorsof its onset. Metabolic profiling in diabetes promises immensepotential for better understanding the biological processesassociated with diabetes that might make significant impact on itscontrol and therapy. We performed 1 H NMR- basedmultivariate analysis of serum from prediagnosed diabetespatients and healthy controls. 1 H NMR experiments ondiabetes and control serum samples were performed on aBrukerBiospin Avance 500 spectrometer using water presaturation bysuppressing macromolecular signals using Carr-Purcell-Meoboom-Gillpulse train. Two-dimensional J resolved spectra were also obtainedseparately for each sample. The real part of the processed dataand 450-tilted F2 projection of J-resolved spectra were subjectedto multivariate analysis using several analysis methods afterremoving the regions containing water (4.8 ppm) andreference (0 ppm) signals. Excellent separation ofdiseases and control samples into clusters was observed in theanalysis and the separation showed better improvement when thedata were subjected to principle component analysis (PCA) usingmean centered variables filtered using the thresholds determinedfrom correlation. A series of complementary markers wasidentified. Correlation of these markers with glucose will also bediscussed.
The effect of diet on metabolites found in rat urine sampleshas been investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and anew ambient ionization mass spectrometry experiment, extractiveelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EESI-MS). Changes indiet at 24-hour intervals led to perceptible changes in thespectral data of both NMR and MS. Urine samples from rats withthree different dietary regimens were readily distinguished usingprincipal component analysis (PCA) on metabolites detected by NMR and MS. To observe the effectof diet on metabolic pathways, metabolites related to specificpathways were also investigated using multivariate statisticalanalysis. Discrimination is also observed by making observationson restricted compound sets. Principal component analysis (PCA)was used to separate the rats into groups according to theirdifferent dietary regimens using the full NMR, EESI-MS data, orrestricted sets of peaks in the mass spectra corresponding only tometabolites found in the urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups(UCMAG). By contrast, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)from the score plots showed that metabolites of purine metabolismobscure the classification relative to the full metabolite set.These results suggest that it may be possible to reduce the numberof statistical variables used by monitoring the biochemicalvariability of particular pathways. It should also be possible bythis procedure to reduce the effect of diet in the biofluidsamples for such purposes as disease detection.

Arsenic contamination of surface and ground water is an ongoingproblem that places the health of people around the world at risk.Found in abundance in the earth's crust, As mobilizes overtime and leaches into surrounding bodies of water. Consequently,there is a need for methods to reliably monitor arsenic indrinking water. While several laboratory-based methods exist forthe determination of arsenic; those methods are costly,time-consuming, and require trained operators. Field test kits havebeen developed as a relatively simple, low-cost method for thedetermination of arsenic, however, these methods tend to produceunreliable results at concentrations near the maximum permissiblelimit of 10 mg/L set by the WHO. The method discussed inthis work involves the determination of As(III) and As(V) inwater. A portable sensor based on a quartz crystal microbalance(QCM) will be employed. QCM sensors offer the advantage of beinglightweight and relatively simple to operate; however, they areinherently nonselective. The selectivity of the surface will beenhanced using a functionalized polymer to specifically bindAs(V). A flow injection system will be used in conjunction with aflow cell apparatus for online determinations. The sensor will beevaluated for its ability to determine arsenic in solution and inthe gas phase. The selectivity of the sensor, along withanalytical figures of merit, will be determined. Once theappropriate parameters are optimized, the performance of thesensor will be determined using standard reference materials andreal-life water samples collected from local bodies of water.
Hanford tank waste treatment and immobilization plant (WTP)initiated the development of laser ablation inductively coupledplasma atomic emission spectrometry (LA-ICP-AES) for elementalanalysis of sludge samples during vitrification of high-levelradioactive waste (HLW). This alternate technology will supportrapid turn-around time (TAT) requirement for process controlanalysis. Simulant sludge samples were converted to glass pucksand analyzed at Battelle Pacific Northwest Division (PNWD) andSavannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) using different UV laserunits and ICP-AES instruments. The studies at PNWD used New WaveUP-266 laser and Thermo Jarrel Ash (TJA) axial ICP-AES while SRNLutilized Cetac LSX-200 laser in conjunction with Perkin-ElmerOptima 3000 radial ICP-AES. The internal standards used were alsodifferent in two studies. PNWD utilized Cu and SRNL used Sc and Sifor internal correction. Irrespective of different instruments andmethods, similar results were obtained from both laboratories. Theprecision of analysis was <10% RSD for majority ofelements of interest. The accuracy for elements at concentrationsgreater than 3xMDL (method detection limit) was within+10% of true value. Both laboratories demonstrated thefeasibility of TAT of <9 hours for LA-ICP-AES analysis andshowed data comparability to conventional dissolution ICP-AESmethod. The application of the developed method for remotelyablating HLW samples in a hot cell environment will bediscussed.

The rapid and sensitive determination of pathogenic bacteria isimportant for medical diagnosis, food safety, and today'sfight against bioterrorism. In this work, we have employed theemerging nanotechnology to develop a highly specific, rapid, andsensitive method for simultaneous identification and quantitativedetermination of target bacteria, primarily, Pseudomonasaeruginosa (PA) and  Klebsiellapneumoniae (KP). The principle of the method is to usefluorescent nanoparticles as labeling reagents to emit signals atdifferent wavelengths for different bacterial cells. Thenanoparticles were developed based on fluorescence resonanceenergy transfer (FRET). Therefore, when a single excitationwavelength is used, multiple emission wavelengths will appear toindicate different target bacteria. The principle discovered inthis study could be extended to the rapid and sensitivedetermination of various bacteria and viruses.
The nanoparticles first conjugated with specific antibodies to form conjugates of nanoparticle-antibody (NP-Ab). Then, the NP-Ab conjugates were used as target bacteria identifiers. Due to the strong fluorescence of the nanoparticles, the identifiers provide high fluorescence signals for trace amount of target bacterial cells. Preliminary results have demonstrated that the antibody conjugated nanoparticles can readily and specifically identify target cells down to a single one within 30 minutes.
Valuable information can be obtained by real-time monitoringpharmaceutical processes such as organic reactions and dissolutiontesting. Example information includes reaction progress, reactionmechanisms, impurity formation, reaction optimization, anddissolution rates. Despite the need, there are presently fewattractive options for monitoring pharmaceutical processes. FTIRprobes have been available for some time, but thetechnique's limited specificity severely limits itsapplication to a small fraction of processes. HPLC is a much moreuniversal technique than FTIR; however this requires verytime-consuming human intervention for sample withdrawal anddilution. This manual process is also prone to human error.
We have developed a system that automates the sampling anddilution processes and allows for unattended monitoring ofpharmaceutical processes by capillary HPLC. The system includes aninline autosampler, capillary HPLC system, and peak-analysissoftware. The system is contained on a compact cart forportability. Real-world processes can be monitored with samplevolumes of tens of microliters and chromatographic results asfrequent as 2 minutes or less.
The authors will describe real-time monitoring of reactionprogress from organic reactors using an inline autosampler anddilution device coupled to a capillary HPLC. Analytical figures ofmerit for the system will be presented.
New drugs can take twelve years and $850 MM todevelop partly due to transferring underqualified candidates intodevelopment. To vet candidates earlier, ADME-Tox and other studiesare moved forward into discovery which increases sample loads 10Xfrom 600 to 2000 samples/day compared to development. ModernLCMS systems keep pace by providing up to five-order dynamicrange and run-to-run capabilities approaching 1200 samples/daymaking autosamplers the throughput and integrity bottleneck.
This paper describes a novel autosampler based on newlyinvented sample handling and injection technology that effectivelydecouples carryover from throughput. The invention utilizesautonomous, untethered, asynchronously operating syringes whichhave 8 mm outer diameter, weighs 26 grams, requiresno electrical or fluidic tethers, can deliver against hundreds ofpsi, possesses radio frequency identification (RFID) technologyfor volume, calibration, and usage data, and contains on-boardmemory to store and record sample workflows making workflowmanagement fully automated and sample-centric. These featuresenable a new autosampler workflow model with substantially greaterthroughput via parallel operation of multiple syringes, real-timeworkflow, chain of custody, audit trail monitoring, reducedprocessing errors, and built-in fault tolerance and recovery.
While this new approach can be broadly applied to anyautosampling application, we demonstrate its use in ADME-Toxstudies providing 1800 samples/day throughput with 0.005%carryover (reserpine) compared to 250 samples/day with>0.05% carryover (reserpine less than four-orderdynamic range) as tested on 3 conventional autosamplers. Twoindependent pharmaceutical case studies demonstrate throughput andcarryover levels remain consistent throughout a five-dayevaluation period.
Signal enhancement observed in SERS is attributable to thepresence of noble metal nanostructures on substrate surfaces. Therational development of SERS active substrates depends criticallyon the homogeneity and intensity of surface plasmon resonances,properties that are strongly dependent on both the morphology anddielectric properties of the metals and composite materials makingup the SERS substrates. Enhancement can be controlled by theshape, size, and spacing of metallic nanoparticles. Previousstudies in our group have shown that elliptical arrays havepromising geometries for this purpose. Using electron beamlithography, we fabricate close-packed arrays of ellipses withaspect ratios ranging 50:100–300:300 nm. The arrays are composed of a negativephotoresist that, once the lithography process is complete, iscoated with a noble metal through physical vapor deposition. Inthis work, studies are done to determine the optimum thickness anddeposition rate of noble metal for these substrates. It is thenfound that by altering the aspect ratio of ellipses, and bychanging the gap between ellipses in an array, SERS enhancementcan be tuned. The underlying nanostructuring of the SERSsubstrates greatly improves the collected SERS signal as can beseen when data are collected “on-pattern” versus“off-pattern.” The stokes responses of theselithographically produced nanopatterns are collected with SERS,while scanning electron microscopy is used to examine patternsurfaces after lithographic development and after noble metaldeposition.
