Potassium [(1S)-1-azido-2-phenyl­eth­yl]trifluorido­borate

The title compound, K+·C8H8BF3N3−, is a salt containing the chiral organic trifluorido­borate anion. The organic anions and potassium cations are tightly bound to each other by the coordination K—F [2.654 (3)–3.102 (3) Å] and K—N [2.951 (4)–3.338 (4) Å] inter­actions. Thus, the potassium cation adopts a nine-vertex coordination polyhedron, which can be described as a distorted monocapped tetra­gonal anti­prism. In the crystal, the organic anions and potassium cations form layers parallel to (001). Weak C—H⋯π inter­actions between neighbouring phenyl rings further stabilize the crystal.
