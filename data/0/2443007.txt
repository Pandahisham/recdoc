From 1980 through 1988, biliary surgery was performed in 197 patients with acute gallstone disease andconcomitant elevation of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT) or serum glutamic pyruvictransaminase (SGPT) of over 300 Karmen units. In 137 patients, anatomic inspection and liver biopsywere performed during the acute stage of the disease. Impacted and floating bile duct stones were foundin 69 (50%) and in 43 (32%) of the 137 patients, respectively. The main liver histology was necrosis ofliver cells. After surgery, high serum transaminase fell rapidly with immediate recovery in 99% of thepatients. In the remaining 60 patients, their signs and symptoms settled soon after initial conservativetreatment and surgery was performed after an average time of 21 days. At laparotomy, impacted bileduct stones were found in 2 (3%) and liver histology revealed regeneration of liver cells.
These findings suggest that marked elevation of serum transaminase in patients with acute gallstonedisease might be due to an acute inflammatory liver cell injury caused by impacted bile duct stones ormigrating stones, which would be transient and reversible after early resolution of the bile ductobstruction.
