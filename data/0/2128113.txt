THE EFFECT OF FLOOD DIURESIS ON HEMOGLOBINURIA

 Flood diuresis so far lowers the renal threshold for hemoglobin that the pigment appears in quantity in the urine as result of a hemoglobinemia insufficient under ordinary circumstances to lead to the elimination of even a trace of it. In pathological conditions that involve blood destruction hemoglobin probably passes into the tubules much more often than it reaches the urine, being prevented therefrom by the resorptive activity of the tubular epithelium.
