Indian Menopause Society guidelines


India has witnessed a sea change in medicine in the last three decades. An explosion of information and technology has brought us closer to the rest of the world. Although the Indian practitioner now has a greater range to glean information from, clinical practice cannot be based solely on knowledge from textbooks. It has to take into consideration the needs of the local population, and their wants and desires. The Indian patient is genetically, phenotypically, and psychologically different from any other patient in the world. A glaring example is that of menopause! Although menopause sets in in the same manner in India as anywhere else in the world, the perception, symptomatology, and hence management of menopause are different in this country. It therefore becomes imperative to have country-specific evidence-based guidelines to help the clinician decide the best for the patient.
This is a special issue of the third revised guidelines on the various aspects in the management of menopause brought out by the Indian Menopause Society under the leadership of Dr. Meeta, Immediate Past President and guest editor for this issue. It also contains the first Indian guidelines for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
As there is not much published Indian data on the subject of menopause, both the guidelines have been formulated on the basis of the review of guidelines issued by various other international and national bodies across the globe, Indian publications, and good local clinical practices. It is hoped that this would help the Indian practitioner practice midlife management in an evidence-based manner.
