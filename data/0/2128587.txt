CLASSIFICATION OF THE HEMOLYTTC STREPTOCOCCI BY THE PRECIPITIN REACTION

 A method is described for the preparation from hemolytic streptococci of extracts containing a soluble precipitating substance. By the use of such extracts, it is shown that nearly all members of this family yield a common precipitable substance. So far, therefore, as concerns the precipitin reaction, the hemolytic streptococci form a practically homogeneous group.
