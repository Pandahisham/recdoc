LIVER DAMAGE AND URINARY EXCRETION OF SULFATE IN RATS FED l-CYSTINE, dl-METHIONINE, AND CYSTEIC ACID

 1. Rats fed l-cystine at excessive levels excrete large amounts of sulfate sulfur in the urine and develop liver necrosis and cirrhosis. 2. Rats fed dl-methionine at excessive levels excrete large amounts of sulfate sulfur, but do not develop liver necrosis and cirrhosis. 3. Rats fed cysteic acid at high levels excrete relatively small amounts of sulfate, but do develop liver necrosis and cirrhosis. 4. In conclusion, there is no apparent correlation between the amount of sulfate formed and the development of liver damage in rats fed l-cystine, dl-methionine, and cysteic acids.
