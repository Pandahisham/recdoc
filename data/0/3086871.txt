A systematic search of the literature reveals limited evidence to support use of                    aripiprazole, a second-generation antipsychotic medication, in maintenance                    therapy of bipolar disorder, despite widespread use.
Aripiprazole, a second-generation antipsychotic medication, has been                        increasingly used in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and                        received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this                        indication in 2005. Given its widespread use, we sought to critically review                        the evidence supporting the use of aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment                        of bipolar disorder and examine how that evidence has been disseminated in                        the scientific literature.
We systematically searched multiple databases to identify double-blind,                        randomized controlled trials of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment                        of bipolar disorder while excluding other types of studies, such as                        open-label, acute, and adjunctive studies. We then used a citation search to                        identify articles that cited these trials and rated the quality of their                        citations. Our evidence search protocol identified only two publications,                        both describing the results of a single trial conducted by Keck et al.,                        which met criteria for inclusion in this review. We describe four issues                        that limit the interpretation of that trial as supporting the use of                        aripiprazole for bipolar maintenance: (1) insufficient duration to                        demonstrate maintenance efficacy; (2) limited generalizability due to its                        enriched sample; (3) possible conflation of iatrogenic adverse effects of                        abrupt medication discontinuation with beneficial effects of treatment; and                        (4) a low overall completion rate. Our citation search protocol yielded 80                        publications that cited the Keck et al. trial in discussing the use of                        aripiprazole for bipolar maintenance. Of these, only 24 (30%)                        mentioned adverse events reported and four (5%) mentioned study                        limitations.
A single trial by Keck et al. represents the entirety of the literature on                        the use of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.                        Although careful review identifies four critical limitations to the                        trial's interpretation and overall utility, the trial has been                        uncritically cited in the subsequent scientific literature.

Bipolar disorder (manic depression) is a serious, long-term mental illness                        that affects about 1% of adults at some time during their life. It                        usually develops in late adolescence or early adulthood and affects men and                        women from all backgrounds. People with bipolar disorder experience wild                        mood swings that interfere with daily life and damage relationships. During                        “manic” episodes, which can last several months if untreated,                        they may feel euphoric (“high”), energetic, or irritable. They                        may be full of ambitious plans, feel creative, and spend money recklessly.                        They can also have psychotic symptoms—they may see or hear things that                        are not there. During depressive episodes, affected individuals may feel                        helpless, worthless, and suicidal. Treatments for bipolar disorder include                        drugs to stabilize mood swings (for example, lithium and anticonvulsant                        medications), antidepressants to treat depressive episodes, and                        antipsychotic drugs to treat manic episodes. Psychotherapy can also help and                        patients can be taught to recognize the signs of approaching manic or                        depressive episodes and the triggers for these episodes.
Treatment of bipolar disorder is divided into three phases: acute treatment                        lasting about 2 months to achieve remission, continuance treatment lasting                        from months 2 through 6 to prevent relapse, and long-term maintenance                        treatment to prevent recurrence. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics                        are widely used for acute treatment of manic episodes but are also used for                        maintenance treatment. For example, the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole,                        which gained US approval for this indication in 2005, is now a popular                        choice among clinicians for treating bipolar disorder. But how much evidence                        is there to support aripiprazole's use in the maintenance treatment of                        bipolar disorder? Here, the researchers systematically search the published                        literature for double-blind randomized controlled trials of aripiprazole for                        this indication, critically analyze the quality of these trials, and                        undertake a citation search to investigate how the results of these trials                        have been disseminated in the scientific literature. In double-blind                        randomized controlled trials, patients are randomly assigned to receive a                        test drug or a control (generally, placebo), and the effects of these drugs                        compared; patients in the trial, and physicians administering treatments,                        would not know who is receiving the test drug or control until the trial is                        completed.
The researchers' search for reports of double-blind randomized                        controlled trials of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of bipolar                        disorder using predefined criteria identified only two publications, both                        describing a single trial—the Keck trial. Critical review of this                        trial identified four issues that limit its interpretation for supporting                        aripiprazole as a maintenance therapy: the trial was too short to                        demonstrate maintenance efficacy; all the trial participants had responded                        well to aripiprazole as an acute treatment so the generalizability of the                        trial's results was limited; the trial design meant that some of the                        apparent beneficial treatment results could have reflected the adverse                        effects of abrupt medication discontinuation in the control group; and the                        trial had a low completion rate. The researchers' citation search                        identified 80 publications that cited the Keck trial in discussions of the                        use of aripiprazole for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Only a                        quarter of these papers presented any numerical data from the trial, only a                        third mentioned any of the reported adverse events, and only four papers                        mentioned the trial's limitations.
This evaluation of the evidence base supporting the use of aripiprazole for                        the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder shows that the justification                        for this practice relies on the results of one published trial. Moreover,                        the methodology and reporting of this trial mean that its results cannot                        easily be generalized to inform the treatment of most patients with bipolar                        disorder. Worryingly, the researchers' citation search indicates that                        the Keck trial has been cited uncritically in the ensuing scientific                        literature. Although the unique features of bipolar disorder make it hard to                        undertake controlled studies of treatment options, the researchers express                        concern that “the publication and apparently uncritical acceptance of                        this trial may be diverting patients away from more effective                        treatments”.

First-generation antipsychotic medications have been used for many decades in the                short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder [1].                Second-generation antipsychotic medications have increasingly gained popularity for                this use as well [2]. However, their promotion for the maintenance treatment of                bipolar disorder is a more recent phenomenon [3]–[6]. In one recently published                nationally representative survey of physicians, mood disorders accounted for the                majority of antipsychotic medication prescriptions [7], and a recent shift to                prescription of antipsychotic medications was observed in a sample of San Diego                county Medicaid beneficiaries with bipolar disorder [8].
Traditionally, the clinical care of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder has been                divided into three phases (borrowed from clinical consensus about the phases of                treatment for major depressive disorder [9],[10]): treatment of acute episodes                to symptomatic remission, continuation treatment to prevent relapse, and maintenance                treatment to prevent recurrence. The 2 mo following recovery from the acute episode                is commonly described as acute phase recovery, and the continuation phase of                treatment (during which the natural course of the episode is considered still active                even though the patient may be asymptomatic) is defined as lasting from months 2                through 6 [11],[12]. The medication used for treatment in the acute phase is                often extended for treatment in the continuation and maintenance phases [13],[14] and in this                context may include lithium, valproate, lamotrigine, or a second-generation                antipsychotic medication such as olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone,                or ziprasidone [15]. However, although the use of second-generation                antipsychotic medications to treat acute mania is supported by a relatively                well-established evidence base [16]–[18], efficacy in treatment of acute mania does not                necessarily imply efficacy for maintenance or prophylaxis [13],[19],[20]. As Goodwin and Jamison note:                “Simply because a drug has anti-manic properties (and if continued, will                protect against relapse back into mania in the months after the acute episode), one                cannot assume that it will be effective in the prevention of new episodes. While                this assumption may be true (to some extent) for lithium, it is not well supported                by the data with respect to all the other antimanic agents” (p. 800) [21].
Despite the need for robust evidence on the maintenance and/or long-term prophylactic                treatment of bipolar disorder, to date very little has been supplied in this regard                    [4],[15],[22],[23]. There remains                little consensus about recommended courses of maintenance or prophylactic treatment,                and consequently overall psychopharmacological treatment patterns vary widely [24]–[28]. Aripiprazole,                first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of                schizophrenia in 2002, is the newest of the second-generation antipsychotic                medications to have obtained FDA approval for use in bipolar disorder. In 2004 it                was approved for the treatment of acute manic and mixed episodes associated with                bipolar disorder, and in 2005 it was granted an additional indication for the                maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [29]. Since its approval, aripiprazole                has rapidly become a popular choice among clinicians in the maintenance treatment of                bipolar disorder. Total U.S. sales for aripiprazole (across all indications)                increased from US$1.5 billion in 2005 to US$4 billion in 2009 [30]. In a recent study                in which U.S.-based physicians were queried about their preferred pharmacological                treatments for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, only 3% of psychiatrists                and 7% of primary care physicians named aripiprazole as their first choice                for treating schizophrenia, whereas 23% of psychiatrists and 16% of                primary care physicians named aripiprazole as their first choice for treating                bipolar disorder [31]. Consistent with this survey, from 2002–2007, the                most common indication for the prescription of aripiprazole in office-based practice                settings was for bipolar disorder (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth                Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] Diagnosis Code 296.0) [32].
In the setting of chronic illnesses such as bipolar disorder, critical appraisal of                long-term treatments has important implications for policy making. Overall                medication costs for the chronically ill are driven largely by decisions about the                ongoing use of prescription medications, rather than by decisions about whether to                initiate their use [33]. Spending on prescription medications is the                fastest-growing category of the U.S. health care budget [34], further underscoring the need                for a rigorous evidence-based approach regarding their prescription and use. Given                the rapid adoption and widespread use of aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment                of bipolar disorder, we decided to review the scientific data supporting its use in                this setting. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of this                data into the subsequent scientific literature.
We sought to identify double-blind (i.e., where participants and physicians                    administering medications were blind to treatment assignment), randomized                    controlled studies of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of bipolar                    disorder, while also avoiding inadvertent inclusion of acute treatment studies                    or other study designs. Therefore we required studies to have a duration greater                    than 4 mo in order to be included in our review, and excluded open-label, acute,                    and adjunctive studies. We searched for published literature as well as                    unpublished and ongoing clinical trials, with no language restrictions. The                    following systematic search strategy was employed to search PubMed:                    “bipolar disorder”[MeSH Terms] OR                    (“bipolar”[All Fields] AND “disorder”[All                    Fields]) OR (“bipolar disorder”[All Fields]) AND                    (“aripiprazole”[Substance Name] OR                    “aripiprazole”[All Fields]) AND                    (“maintenance”[MeSH Terms] OR                    “maintenance”[All Fields]). We also searched Scopus                    (including Embase and MEDLINE) using the same search terms (“bipolar                    disorder” OR “bipolar” AND “disorder” AND                    “aripiprazole” AND “maintenance”). We also searched                    ClincalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3                    of 4, July 2010), and the World Health Organization International Clinical                    Trials Registry Platform Search Portal using the terms                    “aripiprazole” and “bipolar.” We did not attempt to                    contact the manufacturer directly to inquire about possibly unpublished trials,                    but we screened all listings on the Bristol-Myers Squibb Clinical Trials                    Disclosure Web site under Clinical Trial Results, Psychiatric Disorders [35]. All                    searches were conducted in July 2010. And finally, we submitted a request under                    the U.S. Freedom of Information Act [36] for the supplemental New                    Drug Application (NDA) filed by the study sponsor to obtain additional labeling                    for the use of aripiprazole as maintenance therapy in bipolar I disorder [29], and we                    searched it manually for further reference to other published or unpublished                    studies.
We also sought to better understand the influence of the primary evidence on the                    broader scientific literature. To do this, we used the Web of Science(R) Science                    Citation Index Expanded to search for articles that cited the primary evidence                    identified through the evidence search protocol detailed above. Next, we                    evaluated the articles on how they cited the primary evidence, using criteria                    similar to those used in a previous study on the quality of news media reports                    of medication trials [37]. Each of the citing articles was rated on three                    quality criteria by a single study author (NZR). A 15% random sample of                    articles (n = 15) was double-coded                    independently by another study author (ACT), and the Cohen's kappa                    coefficient was calculated in order to assess the degree of inter-rater                    agreement [38]. We chose dichotomous quality ratings to provide                    conservative estimates of citation quality and in order to limit subjective                    judgments by the rater. First, articles were screened for any mention of the use                    of aripiprazole specifically for ongoing, maintenance, or prophylactic treatment                    of bipolar disorder. If the answer to this question was “yes,” then                    the article was further rated on the three quality criteria: (1) whether the                    article reported any quantitative data from the primary evidence (e.g., odds                    ratios, percentages, or p-values); (2) whether the article                    mentioned any adverse events described in the primary evidence; and (3) whether                    the article mentioned any limitations of the primary evidence.
Although our citation search protocol was not specifically targeted towards                    identifying treatment guidelines and review articles on pharmacological                    treatment strategies in bipolar disorder, we manually highlighted for further                    discussion those that were identified in the citation search. Our citation                    search protocol likely underestimates the influence of the primary evidence                    because we did not also use a database such as Google Scholar that could have                    also identified guidelines implemented by hospitals, government, or other                    institutions whose documents in this area have not been published in                    peer-reviewed journals or indexed in services such as PubMed. However, we chose                    to highlight treatment guidelines and reviews because they can be particularly                    influential in shaping prescribing behavior.
Our primary evidence search protocol identified 177 unique citations (Figure 1). Of these 177 citations,                only two publications met criteria for inclusion in our review [39],[40]. Searching the clinical trials                registries yielded two listings meeting inclusion criteria, but these referred to                the two publications already identified (Figure 2) [39],[40]. Further details on the excluded                acute and adjunctive studies are provided in Tables S1 and S2. Two                unpublished trials initially appeared to meet criteria for inclusion but were                ultimately excluded. The first, Otsuka NCT00606177 [41], was a 3-wk placebo-controlled                trial of aripiprazole for treatment of acute mania with a 22-wk extension phase, but                it was described as currently still recruiting study participants. The second, BMS                CN138-135LT [42], was a completed 40-wk extension of a 12-wk randomized                lithium- and placebo-controlled trial of aripiprazole for acute mania. Although the                12-wk acute outcomes data from BMS CN138-135 were published in a peer-reviewed                journal [43], the                outcomes data from the 40-wk extension have not, to our knowledge, been published                (and the little data made available in the synopsis posted online by the                manufacturer were inadequate for detailed critical assessment). The                manufacturer's synopsis indicates that 4.5% of participants on                aripiprazole completed the extension phase, compared to 8.1% for those on                lithium. A third arm of the study, completed by 8.5% of participants,                entailed treatment with placebo for 3 wk followed by crossover to aripiprazole.                Finally, the supplemental NDA contained no references to additional studies,                published or unpublished, meeting inclusion criteria (Text S1) [29].
These publications were identified using a systematic search of PubMed and                        Scopus, as well as a manual search of the supplemental new drug application                        submitted to the FDA to obtain an additional indication for the use of                        aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.
These clinical trials were identified using a systematic search of                        ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the                        World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry, and                        the Bristol-Myers Squibb Clinical Trials Disclosure Web site, as well as a                        manual search of the supplemental new drug application submitted to the FDA                        to obtain an additional indication for the use of aripiprazole in the                        maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. The “duplicates” were                        each matched to published studies (see Figure 1).
The two peer-reviewed publications included in our review report the results of a                single randomized trial (hereafter referred to as “the Keck trial”)                implemented under the auspices of the Aripiprazole Study Group and sponsored by the                manufacturer of the drug, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. One publication describes the                initial 26-wk double-blind phase [39], and the other its 74-wk extension [40]. We also identified a post hoc                subgroup analysis of data from the Keck trial focused on participants diagnosed with                the rapid-cycling variant of bipolar disorder [44]. We also identified a separate                trial [45], also                authored by Keck and colleagues, examining the efficacy of aripiprazole in the                treatment of acute manic episodes, with outcomes assessed at 3 wk. Given the paucity                of available evidence on aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of bipolar                disorder, we decided to review the Keck trial [39],[40] in detail.
A total of 633 adult participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder                    were enrolled in the Keck trial. A flow chart of the trial is shown in Figure 3. For inclusion,                    participants must either have completed a prior 3-wk acute mania trial [45], met                    eligibility criteria for a prior acute mania trial but declined participation in                    that trial, or experienced a manic or mixed episode within the prior 3 mo. The                    publication describing the 26-wk double-blind phase [39] indicates that participants                    were recruited from 76 sites in the U.S., Mexico, and Argentina (but does not                    specify the numbers of sites within each country or the numbers of patients from                    each site). Of the original enrollees, 567 entered the “stabilization                    phase,” which consisted of open-label treatment with aripiprazole for                    6–18 wk. Participants remained in this phase until their Young Mania                    Rating Scale (YMRS) was ≤10 and their Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating                    Scale (MADRS) was ≤13 during four consecutive visits over a minimum of 6 wk.                    206 participants completed the stabilization phase. Of these, 161 entered the                    double-blind phase. The supplemental NDA indicates that participants who                    completed the stabilization phase and entered randomization were derived from 45                    sites in the U.S. (n = 124), three sites                    in Argentina (n = 7), and two sites in                    Mexico (n = 30). These 161 participants                    were assigned either to an intervention arm in which they continued taking                    aripiprazole at the stabilizing dose                    (n = 77 or 78; both numbers are reported                        [40]) or to                    a placebo arm in which aripiprazole was abruptly discontinued and replaced with                    placebo (n = 83). 39 (50% of the 77                    or 78 who entered randomization) in the intervention arm and 28 participants                    (34%) in the placebo arm completed the 26-wk double-blind phase. Time to                    relapse was described as longer for participants treated with aripiprazole                    compared to those who were switched to placebo. Mean times to relapse were not                    provided, but the hazard ratio for relapse was given as 0.52 (95%                    confidence interval [CI] 0.30–0.91). When time to relapse was                    partitioned into manic versus depressive relapse, the difference in overall time                    to relapse was found to be driven primarily by an effect on manic relapse                    (23% relapse rate on placebo versus 8% relapse rate on                    aripiprazole). No differences in time to depressive relapse (13% versus                    12%) or to mixed state relapse (6% versus 5%) were noted.                    Keck and colleagues concluded that aripiprazole “was superior to placebo                    in maintaining efficacy in patients with bipolar I disorder with a recent manic                    or mixed episode who were stabilized and maintained on aripiprazole treatment                    for 6 weeks” (p. 626) [39].
Participants had to complete the 6- to 18-wk stabilization phase before                            they were eligible for randomization. After completion of the 26-wk                            double-blind phase, participants were invited to continue in the 74-wk                            extension phase.
The extension phase of the Keck trial, published as a separate paper [40], followed the                    remaining participants over the subsequent 74 wk: 27 participants in the placebo                    group (of the 28 who completed the double-blind phase) and 39 participants in                    the aripiprazole group. The authors concluded: “Over a 100-week treatment                    period, aripiprazole monotherapy was effective for relapse prevention in                    patients who were initially stabilized on aripiprazole for 6 consecutive weeks,                    and it maintained a good safety and tolerability profile” (p. 1480) [40]. Similar to                    the data from the first 26 wk, time to manic relapse was reported to be longer                    for the aripiprazole group (with no difference between groups in time to                    depressive relapse).
Although the Keck trial was the sole basis for aripiprazole receiving an                    additional FDA-approved indication for the maintenance treatment of bipolar                    disorder [29], we                    believe that reading the Keck trial as supporting the use of aripiprazole for                    this indication is an overinterpretation of the trial's design and the data                    it generated. First, the duration of the Keck trial was insufficient to                    demonstrate prophylactic efficacy. Second, the double-blind phase of the Keck                    trial was based on an enriched sample of patients who had already responded to                    the medication during the stabilization phase, thereby limiting generalizability                    of the trial's findings. Third, the randomized discontinuation design of                    the Keck trial may conflate iatrogenic adverse effects of abrupt medication                    discontinuation with the beneficial effects of short-term continuation                    treatment. All of the putative benefit occurred during the double-blind phase of                    the trial, and little improvement was gained during the extension phase. And                    finally, the overall completion rate was 1.3%, requiring unrealistic                    extrapolation to draw meaningful conclusions. Keck et al. [39],[40] mention lack of                    generalizability as a potential limitation of the enrichment design, but they do                    not discuss how these other limitations may have compromised the trial's                    internal validity.
The FDA's review of the Keck trial identified other substantive concerns,                    including the fact that the p-value for the primary analysis                    changed from 0.02 to 0.10 when the statistical reviewer excluded data from one                    of the trial's two Mexican sites (where the relapse rate among participants                    in the aripiprazole arm was lower than the other trial sites) [46]. While of                    general concern, this and other issues identified by the FDA are unrelated to                    our methodological critiques. All of these factors undercut even a cautious                    interpretation of the Keck trial as supporting the use of aripiprazole for                    maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Below we review each of these                    criticisms in detail.
In the open-label phase of the Keck trial, stability was defined by whether                        or not a participant maintained YMRS and MADRS scores in the asymptomatic                        range for at least 6 consecutive weeks. To meet this criterion, on average                        the trial participants spent 89 d in the stabilization phase. Comparing                        their own work to other randomized discontinuation studies of maintenance                        treatment in bipolar disorder that required a shorter duration of stability                            [47]–[49], Keck et al.                        describe their stability criterion as “the most stringent criteria to                        date to define stability” (p. 634) [39]. Intervention-arm                        participants who had achieved stability on aripiprazole were then assigned                        to continue with aripiprazole, and placebo-arm participants abruptly                        switched to placebo, for the following 26 wk.
Contrary to the authors' claims, we argue here that, given the natural                        history of bipolar disorder, the design of the Keck trial was unsuitable for                        evaluating the efficacy of aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment of                        bipolar disorder. The episodic nature of recurrent mania and depression                        require investigators to randomize, enroll, and retain patients for a                        duration sufficient to demonstrate maintenance and/or prophylactic efficacy.                        While there is high interindividual variation, the median length of                        untreated episodes has been reported to vary from 3–6 mo in clinical                        trial settings and from 2–3 mo in epidemiological studies [50], with                        depressive episodes typically lasting longer than manic episodes [21],[51]. Thus,                        even if one does not accept the other methodological concerns we describe in                        this paper, the Keck trial, with its stabilization criterion of 6 wk, could                        at best be used to demonstrate a short-term benefit of continuation                        treatment in preventing relapse of symptoms attributable to an ongoing acute                        episode [52]. Demonstration of maintenance efficacy in                        preventing recurrence of mood episodes would require benefit to be shown at                        least 6 mo after the acute phase. 6 mo has been traditionally recognized as                        the point at which continuation treatment becomes maintenance treatment                            [10],[11],[12],[52]–[54]. Appropriately, the                        clinical review contained in the supplemental NDA describes a meeting with                        the study's sponsors in which the FDA's Division of                        Neuropharmacological Drug Products “expressed that the duration of the                        open-label stabilization phase defines duration of effect and noted that an                        optimal study design would include a six month open-label stabilization                        phase and randomized withdrawal of patient subgroups at specified                        timepoints” (p. 9) [55]. The leading                        textbook in the field suggests an even more stringent threshold study                        duration: “Because the natural history of bipolar disorder is for it                        to recur, on average, every 16–18 months, true prophylaxis cannot be                        evaluated in 6 or 12 months” (p. 801) [21]. Although somewhat                        controversial, the idea that demonstration of true prophylactic efficacy                        requires a study duration longer than that which has been typically utilized                        has been supported by other leading researchers as well [11],[52],[56].
Only participants who had responded to aripiprazole in the stabilization                        phase of the trial were included in the double-blind phase of the trial. Of                        the 567 participants who entered the stabilization phase, only 206 completed                        it. Some of the randomized participants received unblinded medication and                        were therefore discontinued [29], so the double-blind efficacy dataset consisted                        of 161 participants. This means that 361 of the 567 (74%)                        participants who entered the stabilization phase but dropped out were                        excluded from randomization because of adverse events, lack of efficacy,                        withdrawal of consent, and other reasons as detailed in the                        publication—leaving behind a selected group of participants who had                        responded favorably to aripiprazole in the stabilization phase to be                        subsequently randomized. This design could have the effect of biasing the                        trial's findings away from the null [57], and, even in the                        absence of such bias, the results from this enriched sample cannot be                        generalized to the majority of persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This                        limitation of the randomized discontinuation design has long been recognized                        by drug trialists [11],[12],[56],[58]–[65] and is not dissimilar to                        criticisms voiced about the first generation of randomized trials evaluating                        the use of lithium for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder, i.e., that                        those study designs selected preferentially for lithium-responsive variants                        of the disorder [66],[67].
The randomized discontinuation study design could explain the putatively                        positive findings on preventing relapse even in the absence of a true drug                        effect. In the Keck trial, the randomization sample was enriched with                        participants who had already responded to aripiprazole in the stabilization                        phase and were therefore more likely to experience an iatrogenic relapse of                        symptoms when aripiprazole was abruptly discontinued in the double-blind                        phase. Abrupt discontinuation, or even abrupt partial removal, of a drug                        used for maintenance has long been known to provoke relapse in patients                        diagnosed with bipolar disorder [68]–[77]. This                        “bipolar rebound phenomenon” has been most often described for                        lithium, but it has also been observed in the setting of abruptly withdrawn                        antiepileptic [78], antipsychotic [3],[12],[48],[56],[78]–[80],                        and antidepressant medications [59],[75],[78],[81] administered to persons diagnosed with other mood                        and psychotic disorders. For this reason, Geddes et al. specifically                        excluded studies with a randomized discontinuation design from their                        systematic review and meta-analysis of the long-term use of lithium in the                        treatment of bipolar disorder [82].
Thus, if aripiprazole had no effect on preventing relapse, the Keck trial                        might still be expected to show a higher relapse rate early in the                        double-blind phase among participants assigned to the placebo arm (compared                        to those assigned to the intervention arm), and then similar relapse rates                        between study arms during the extension phase. This particular design                        element appears to have substantially influenced the outcome of the Keck                        trial, as is evident from a comparison of data from the 26-wk double-blind                        phase with data from the 74-wk extension phase. During the 26-wk                        double-blind phase, 19 out of 83 participants (23%) in the placebo                        arm experienced a manic relapse, whereas only four (5%) did so in the                        subsequent 74-wk extension phase.
When relapse data from the 74-wk extension phase are examined separately from                        those from the first 26 wk (Figure 3), only four participants in the placebo arm experienced                        a relapse to mania, compared to 3 participants in the intervention arm                        (4.8% versus 3.8%). This information is not explicitly                        presented in either paper and can only be discerned by comparing the papers                        side by side and calculating the differences by hand. Figure 4 in the 74-wk extension phase                        publication (p. 1486) [40] shows that 28% of participants in the                        placebo arm relapsed to mania over 100 wk of follow up. Given                            n = 83 in the placebo arm, this                        suggests 23 participants in the placebo arm relapsed to mania over 100 wk of                        follow up. Because 19 participants in the placebo arm relapsed to mania in                        the first 26 wk (Figure 5 in the 26-wk double-blind phase publication                        [p. 531] [39]), this means four participants relapsed to mania                        during the 74-wk extension phase. We employed similar reasoning to calculate                        the number of participants who relapsed to mania in the intervention arm, as                        well as the number of participants who relapsed to depressive and mixed                        states. Similar patterns are observed for relapse to depression and relapse                        to mixed state for the placebo and aripiprazole arms. Thus, virtually all of                        the reported placebo-aripiprazole difference in relapse occurred during the                        first 26 wk of the trial.
These publications were identified using Web of Science(R) Science                                Citation Index Expanded. Those that discussed the Keck study in                                relation to the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder were                                evaluated on three quality indicators, as shown.
Only seven of 39 (18%) aripiprazole-treated participants and five of                        27 (19%) placebo-treated participants completed the 74-wk extension                        phase. The low completion rate in the treatment arm is especially striking                        given that only participants who had proven to be responders in the initial                        stabilization phase were included in the double-blind and extension phases                        and that the placebo group matched the aripiprazole group in terms of trial                        completion. Out of the 633 participants who entered the trial, after                        excluding the 83 who were switched to placebo, only seven                        aripiprazole-treated participants completed the 100-wk trial, for a                        completion rate among aripiprazole-treated participants of less than                        1.3%. This is not explicitly noted anywhere in the paper [40]. Keck et                        al. [40]                        acknowledge that only 12 participants completed the trial, but the smaller                        denominator used for comparison is the number of participants who entered                        the 74-wk extension phase rather than all participants who entered the                        trial.
We argue that drawing meaningful conclusions from a trial with an overall                        completion rate of less than 1.3% is an inappropriate undertaking.                        The completion rate substantially limits generalizability of the                        trial's findings, as trial completers very likely were dissimilar to                        the enrolled and/or randomized participant pools. The meaningful differences                        between completers and noncompleters were demonstrated in a randomized trial                        of divalproex versus lithium for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder                            [83]:                        participants who completed the trial had milder symptoms at baseline and a                        less severe lifetime illness course [84]. Keck et al. identify                        the low completion rate in the extension phase as a potential limitation but                        appeal to the low completion rates observed in other maintenance trials                            [47],[48] to support the generalizability of their results.                        In contrast, we view the similar completion rates observed in other                        long-term studies as similarly raising concerns about how to draw inferences                        from these trials to inform routine clinical practice. Still, we observe                        that other investigators have successfully implemented long-term studies in                        this patient population with greater rates of completion: for example,                        earlier studies of lithium in the treatment of affective disorders                        demonstrated completion rates of 92.9% (26/28) [85] and 73.2%                        (74/101) [86] among lithium-treated participants.
Our citation search protocol identified 80 articles that cited the results from                    the 26-wk double-blind phase [39] and 48 articles that cited the results of the 74-wk                    extension phase [40]. After eliminating duplicates, the two publications                    from the Keck trial garnered 104 subsequent citations in total. Of these citing                    articles, 24 did not contain any mention of the Keck trial in relation to                    long-term or maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder and were excluded from                    further analysis (Figure 4).                    Double-coding revealed a high degree of inter-rater agreement on the quality                    assessment measures. There was 100% agreement on whether the publications                    were classified as mentioning aripiprazole for maintenance treatment. Among the                    double-coded publications mentioning maintenance treatment, there was                    100% agreement on whether quantitative data and limitations were                    mentioned. There was one disagreement about whether adverse events were                    mentioned, yielding a kappa coefficient of 0.75 (95% CI 0.05–0.95).                    The overall kappa coefficient was 0.95 (95% CI 0.73–0.99).
Of the 80 articles that cited the Keck trial in reference to maintenance                    treatment of bipolar disorder, only 20 (25%) presented any quantitative                    data from the Keck trial; the remainder reported qualitative statements only                    (e.g., “Aripiprazole significantly delayed the time to relapse into a new                    mood episode in patients with bipolar I disorder over both 26 and 100 weeks of                    treatment.” [87]). 24 publications (30%) mentioned any of the                    adverse events reported in the trial. Only four (5%) made any mention of                    study limitations.
Among the articles identified through our citation search protocol were eight                    literature reviews [88]–[95] and three bipolar                    treatment guidelines [15],[96],[97] that specifically discussed the use of aripiprazole                    in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Because review articles and treatment                    guidelines can be particularly influential in shaping policy and prescribing                    behavior, we chose to highlight these in our discussion (Table 1). The evidence summaries employed the                    methodologies of consensus panel (n = 3),                    narrative review (n = 6), or systematic                    review (n = 2). Ten of the 11 reviews and                    treatment guidelines contained a financial disclosure related to Bristol-Myers                    Squibb.
A, reported any quantitative data; B, reported any adverse events; C,                                reported any study limitations.
BD, bipolar disorder.
Overall, the eight reviews were favorable in their assessment as to the putative                    efficacy of aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.                    Solely on the basis of the results of the Keck trial, the Texas Medication                    Algorithm Project update listed aripiprazole as having “level 2”                    evidence (out of five levels of quality, with level 1 being the highest-quality)                    for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder [15]. The Canadian Network for                    Mood and Anxiety Treatments and International Society for Bipolar Disorders                    recommended aripiprazole as first-line maintenance treatment of bipolar                    disorder, although it is noted that this is “mainly for preventing                    mania” (p. 235) [96]. This treatment recommendation was based on the Keck                    trial, along with a 30-wk pediatric bipolar trial that has only been published                    in abstract form [98]. The British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP)                    based its positive endorsement of aripiprazole for relapse prevention solely on                    the Keck trial [97]. Contrary to the criticisms we described earlier, the                    BAP guidelines note, “Acute withdrawal of the active agent did not produce                    an excess of early relapse in this study” (p. 26).
Our evaluation of the evidence base supporting the use of aripiprazole for the                maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder reveals that the justification for this                practice relies on the results from a single trial by Keck and colleagues published                in two peer-reviewed journal articles [39],[40]. The methodology and reporting of the Keck trial are such                that the results cannot be generalized to inform the treatment of most patients with                bipolar disorder. Published interpretations of the data notwithstanding, in our                opinion the Keck trial does not provide data to support the use of aripiprazole in                the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. This lack of robust evidence of                benefit should be weighed against the potential for long-term harms that have been                described with other antipsychotic medications [3] and adverse events related to                aripiprazole use, including tremor, akathisia, and significant weight gain [39]. Our concern                about the critical imitations in this trial is further accentuated by the apparent                widespread use of aripiprazole as a first-line agent for the maintenance treatment                of bipolar disorder [31],[32].
Although we appreciate that the unique clinical features of bipolar disorder make                controlled study extremely difficult [67],[84],[99]–[103], many of the                weaknesses we document stem from the use of the randomized discontinuation design.                Further study is needed in order to determine whether the problems described in this                particular case are also more widely applicable to other continuation or maintenance                treatment studies in bipolar disorder. We find unpersuasive the argument that a                randomized discontinuation study such as this is valuable because it reflects common                clinical practice [104],[105]. The two-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial may                yield information that is more clinically useful than the discontinuation design.                Under the parallel design, data from all participants (not just those who                demonstrated an acute response) would contribute to our understanding of the                drug's short- and long-term efficacy: one of two medications (or placebo) would                be given to participants in the acute phase, and they would be followed throughout                the continuation and maintenance phases (and beyond) to document response to                treatment. (This study design, as well as the other study designs we describe,                clearly could be used to study nonpharmacological treatments, including                evidence-based psychotherapies. However, because this paper has emphasized                discussion about pharmacologic treatments, we use the phrase                “medication” for simplicity.) A two-arm, parallel randomized controlled                trial of sufficient duration would directly answer the substantive research                question, “Does aripiprazole treat symptoms to remission and prevent recurrent                episodes when given to patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder presenting in a                manic or mixed state?” This is clearly different from the question answered by                the discontinuation design, “Among patients diagnosed with bipolar presenting                in a manic or mixed state who have achieved a reasonable symptomatic improvement                after being given aripiprazole, should aripiprazole be continued to maintain the                initial improvement?” [106].
The primary disadvantage of the parallel design is that a greater proportion of                (acutely ill) study participants would be subjected to placebo for the full duration                of the trial, exactly the ethical issue that the discontinuation design was intended                to address [107],[108]. Keck et al. [39] stated that they sought to                minimize the extent to which stabilized participants were administered placebo. Yet                their study could have been modified to diminish its exposure to the weaknesses that                we have described above. First, the duration of stability required prior to                randomization could be lengthened. One likely cost of this design modification is                that the proportion of participants actually randomized would decrease further [109]. A second                modification would be to gradually taper the discontinuation of medication among                participants randomized to receive placebo. In previously published randomized                discontinuation studies, medications administered during the open-label phase were                tapered over a period of 2 to 3 wk rather than abruptly discontinued [47],[83]. Greenhouse et                al. [59]                suggest implementing the taper over several months.
Aside from these modifications to the parallel design, other alternatives have been                suggested. Greenhouse et al. [59] proposed an alternative randomization scheme in which                study participants are randomized to one of six treatment strategies. In the acute                phase of treatment, study participants would receive one of two medications. In the                maintenance phase of treatment, study participants would either remain on the                medication initiated during the acute phase, be switched (gradually) to the                alternative medication, or be switched (gradually) to placebo. This innovative study                design would address the substantive research question, “Which treatment                strategy is better in controlling and preventing the recurrence of                depression?” (p. 318) [59]. A pure prophylactic design has also been recommended                    [10],[12],[100], in which                patients previously diagnosed with a recurrent mood disorder would be enrolled                during a medication-free remission period. Then, while participants are in                remission, they would be offered one of two medications (or placebo). All                participants would be followed in the study for a prespecified duration, and the                treatment arms would be compared in terms of time to recurrence of a mood episode.                This design would avoid the previously described error of possibly conflating                beneficial treatment effects with iatrogenic adverse effects of abrupt medication                discontinuation. However, as noted by Goodwin, Whitman, and Ghaemi [12], the failure                of the divalproex study by Bowden et al. [83] was partly attributed to its                enrollment of participants with low severity of illness [84]—and it was the last study                to utilize the lithium-era prophylaxis design.
We recognize that the proposed study designs will be regarded by some as too costly                or infeasible. Although some have suggested that a study with selected limitations                may be useful in guiding clinical practice [104], we would disagree with this                argument. The current “anti-Hippocratic” state of psychopharmacological                practice described by Ghaemi [56],[110] raises questions about the extent to which research with                substantive limitations is appropriately interpreted with conservative                sensibilities. These concerns are borne out in our data. Thomson Reuters Essential                Science Indicators(SM) places the 26-wk double-blind phase publication in the top                1%, and the 74-wk extension phase publication in the top                1%–2%, of papers published in the fields of psychiatry and                psychology. Thus, by our conservative estimates, the Keck trial could be regarded as                relatively influential. More importantly, we found that the Keck trial was cited                uncritically by a subsequent generation of authors, through treatment guidelines,                reviews, and other publications. All failed to note the consequences of abrupt and                premature discontinuation of antimanic medication, especially during the vulnerable                continuation period. The uncritical manner in which the Keck trial has been cited is                reminiscent of the “echo chamber” effect described by Carey et al. [111] in their                assessment of the now-discredited use of gabapentin in the treatment of bipolar                disorder. Although the analogy is somewhat limited as there were no reportedly                positive double-blind trials examining the use of gabapentin for this indication, we                document a similar pattern of uncritical citations of the primary evidence regarding                aripiprazole in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.
Of further concern regarding the uncritical citation of the Keck trial's claims                is that ten of the 11 treatment guidelines and review articles in our sample                contained a financial disclosure related to the drug's manufacturer,                Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Financial conflicts of interest are highly prevalent across                a wide range of medical subfields [112], and while they are known to be associated with                recommendations in review articles [113], there is no systematic research documenting their                influence on clinical practice guideline recommendations [114]. However, financial                conflicts of interest have been found to be associated with biased reporting of                outcomes in randomized trials [115],[116], which serve as the evidence upon which treatment                guideline recommendations are based.
In summary, we provide here a critical appraisal of the available evidence regarding                the use of aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. The                available evidence consists of a single trial by Keck et al. [39],[40], which is subject to several                substantive methodological limitations but has nonetheless been cited uncritically                in the ensuing scientific literature. Several alternative modifications or study                designs may improve the probability of generating more useful data from studies in                this vulnerable patient population to inform the treatment of similar patients in                the future. We are concerned that the publication and apparently uncritical                acceptance of this trial may be diverting patients away from more effective                treatments.
