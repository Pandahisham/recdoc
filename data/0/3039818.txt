After a thorough investigation, we have recently concluded that key results contributed by the first author cannot be reproduced. As the senior and corresponding author, I have therefore decided to retract this paper.
The co-author has been informed, and agrees with this decision. I emphasise that there is no doubt whatsoever about her contribution.
I sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused to readers of this journal.
