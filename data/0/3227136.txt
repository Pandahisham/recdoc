Consistently doing what we know is right and important for “Medicine and Life”


In our consistently doing what we know is right and important for "Medicine and Life", we can express selfesteem and satisfaction after full honest effort with the successful carrying out of the First International Congress "Health – Food – Welfare" which took place at Aro Palace Hotel, Brasov, 15-17 October, 2011, under the patronage of the Romanian Patriarchate, The Romanian Academy, The Ministry of Public Health, The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, The Ministry of Education, Research, Innovation and Sport in collaboration with the International Association of Distribution (A.I.D.A Bruxelles) and EHI Retail Institute. The quality of leadership has been demonstrated by the considerable willingness for cooperation proved by all the stakeholders. That is the reason why we are experiencing a real joy, because, as William Shakespeare said, joy’s soul lies in the doing.
