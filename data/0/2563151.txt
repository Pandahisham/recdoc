The renal adenomas can be confused by imaging diagnosis with malignant renal tumors, but there            are also real biological dilemmas to determine their behavior.The consensus decisions are the following. (1) The adenoma of clear cells is not accepted, instead it is considered that all the clear-cell tumors are carcinomas, with greater or lesser aggressiveness. (2) Among the papillary neoplasms the WHO 2004 renal cell tumors classification are considered as papillary adenomas tumors with a maximum diameter of 5 mm and may represent a continuum biological process to papillary renal cell carcinoma. The papillary adenomas associated with End-kidney and/or acquired cystic disease may have a different pathogenesis. (3) To consider a tumor as an oncocytoma the size is not important, only the cytological features, microscopic, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemically can help, but some chromosomal observations introduce some questions about its relation with the chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. (4) Finally, the metanephric adenoma, a tumor with some morphological similarity with the nephroblastoma must be considered in the renal adenomas diagnosis.

Before sonographic  studies, 85% to 90% of renal masses were malignant, with the majority being renal-cell carcinoma. However, with the increasing frequency of incidentally discovered renal masses, only 70% to 85% of lesions are found to be malignant [1].
When we take on the subjectof benign neoplasias of the kidney, we must make two large groups, the benignmesenchymal neoplasias and the benign epithelial neoplasias or adenomas.
The benign mesenchymaltumors, with the exception of the angiomyolypoma, are usually subclinical andrarely give the pathologist diagnostic problems, although they can be confusedwith malignant neoplasias for imaging diagnosis [2].
The adenomas are a trueclinical-pathological dilemma, not only because they can be confused by imagingdiagnosis, but because there  are biological dilemmas to determine and thereforedifferent questions emerge: firstly, do therenal adenomas really exist?, and secondly, in case they do exist, arethey precursor lesions of renal carcinomas?, and if they were, do we have thepossibility of differentiating the benign neoplasias from the malignant ones?
The current classificationsof renal carcinomas have managed to integrate the genetic and molecularfindings with the cytological characteristics [3]. This conjunction has made itpossible to correlate the histological subtypes with the prognostic andtherapeutic ones. For this reason, we can approach the renal adenomas accordingthey are of clear cells, of eosinophilic cells (oncocytes), with papillary growth,or have a metanephric blastema appearance.
The most frequent renalneoplasia of the adult is the clear cell renal cell carcinoma. When the piecesfrom the nephrectomy are studied with this type of carcinoma, around 10% of thecases are multifocal and small tumor nodes with clear cells can be found. Thissame finding can be made more frequently in kidneys of patients with vonHipel-Lindau disease. These nodes could have been considered adenomas of clearcells, but since Bell'sdescriptions [4] it is well known that some of the small clear-cell tumors havemetastasis capacity and therefore currently the existence of an adenoma ofclear cells is not accepted, instead it is considered that all the clear-celltumors are carcinomas, with greater or lesser aggressiveness.
Having established thisaxiomatic attitude, there is no problem of differential diagnosis; however,from the morphological point of view, the cysticnephroma (Figure 1), formed by multiple separate cysts (which are also knownas multilocular cyst) covered by epithelium without nuclear atypia, monolayer,with eosinophilic cytoplasma, can occasionally be covered by cells of clearcytoplasma, without nuclear atypia. In this case, clear cells must not be foundin the walls and the intercystic stroma. The cystic nephroma does not have anyrelation to the multilocular clear cell carcinoma (despite certain similaritywith it) [5]. Currently, it is being related to other benign neoplasias such asthe mixed epithelial and stromal tumor of the kidney, all of them are much morefrequent in women and with estrogen and progesterone receptors in the stromalcomponent [6].
In about 35% of the cases therenal carcinomas with a papillary pattern have multiple lesions of diversesizes (from millimeters to centimeters), especially those associated withfamily syndromes. This fact again poses the existence of adenomas and theirpossible relation with carcinomas.
The small papillary tumors arecharacterized by a growth of cells with scant cytoplasma (chromophilic cells),occasionally somewhat eosinophilic, with tubular-papillary patterns, welldelimited and not encapsulated (Figure 2). In chromosomal studies, trisomies inchromosomes 7 and 17 were confirmed in the small tumors. Additionally,  other chromosomes  presented tri-tetrasomies  when the in size of the tumor increase. Fromthese findings it was considered that there is a series of small benign lesionsand that the increase in size is associated with greater amount of chromosomalalterations and therefore the possible transformation in papillary carcinomas.For this reason, the WHO 2004 renal cell tumors classification considered tumorswith a maximum diameter of 5 mm as papillary adenomas [3]. In a practical manner, many pathologists considerthat the tumors over 5 mm and up to 10 mm are of low aggressiveness [7].
It should be underscored thatalthough the majority  of the papillaryadenomas  are associated with papillary renalcell carcinoma (47%), they can also be found associated with other variants(16% with clear cell RCC, 8% with chromophobe RCC and 2.5% with oncocytoma)[8].
It should be highlighted that5% of the papillary adenomas are found in sclerosed kidneys (end-kidneys) and18% in patients with acquired cystic disease (with or without dialysis). Theirmorphological characteristics are identical to those associated with carcinomasbut curiously they differ from the latter by not expressing alpha-methylacyl-CoAracemase (AMACR) [8].
In conclusion, papillaryadenoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma may represent a continuum of thesame biological process. Unfortunately, it is not possible to define anunequivocally benign papillary renal adenoma, for this reason the WHO used the size(arbitrarily) as a marker.
The papillary adenomasassociated with end-kidney and/or acquired cystic disease may have a differentpathogenesis.
The clinically most importantrenal cortical adenoma is the oncocytoma, since despite the fact that it is notusually associated with the carcinoma, in the imaging diagnosis it is usuallyconsidered as renal cell carcinoma.
The cytologicalcharacteristics of the oncocytoma are defined by the oncocytic cells (tumorcells arranged in nests, cords, or tubules, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and nomitosis). They are usually solid, homogeneous, with occasional sclerosedcentral areas, which can also present in other tumors, and are of a diameterfrom millimeters up to 12–15 or more centimeters. Therefore, in this tumor type,the criterion of size does not exist [9].
The problem originates in thecytological characteristics that at times are difficult to distinguish fromother neoplasias of eosinophilic cells, such as the clear-cell renal carcinomaseosinophilic variant and especially the chromophobe eosinophilic carcinomas(Figure 3).
To distinguish them, theelectronic microscope, histochemistry (colloidal iron), andimmunohistochemistry can help (Figure 4).
It is interesting to pointout that the chromosomal studies have demonstrated different types ofalterations, and therefore while some tumors do not have any chromosomalalteration, others show translocation11q13 and (−) 1p, 14q, Y [10]. The latter chromosomal alteration is similar tothat of the chromophobe carcinomas (−1p, Y), which together with the finding ofhybrid carcinomas (oncocytoma + chromophobe renal cell carcinoma) especially inthe Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome [11] it has suggested that certain cases ofoncocytomas could evolve into chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.
Arelatively short time ago a tumor was introduced among the renal adenomas thatwas comprised by small cells with scant cytoplasma, uniform, without mitosis,embryonic-appearing, distributed in small round acini with a phenotype similar tothe nephroblastoma (Figure 5). They represent 1% of localized tumors of less than 7 cm. The mean age is 41 years(from 5 to 83 years).  Fifty percent are incidentaland 10% have a polycythemia. Immunohistochemistry,the WT1, CD 56, and CD 57 are positive and the AMACR is negative [12].
Fromthe genetic point of view, it is characterized by allelic loss in 2p13 (56% of the cases) andis differentiated from the nephroblastoma(with alterations 11p13) and from the papillary carcinoma (+7,  +17) [13].
To distinguish the metanephricadenoma from the nephroblastoma, strict diagnostic criteria have been used, andonly accepting the tumors without mitosis and nucleoli as metanephric adenoma.
We see that the criteria usedto consider renal neoplasia as adenoma vary a great deal according to thecellular type (never in the neoformations of clear cells, only in smallneoplasias of papillary pattern, and any size if we are sure that they areoncocytic or metanephric cells). Therefore, it is fundamental to establish thecellular type, and this determination is usually done with the usualpathological anatomical methods with the help of the immunohistochemicalmarkers to which occasionally molecular methods can be added.
