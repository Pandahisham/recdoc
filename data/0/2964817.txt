PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF LEG FRACTURE PATIENTS

Fifty consecutive leg fracture patients and an equal number of age and sex matched normal controls were evaluated by psychiatric interview and mental status examination, Sinha's anxiety scale (SAS). Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and the Michigan alcoholism screening test (MAST). Detailed evaluation revealed a high prevalence of alcohol dependence/ abuse (34%) and depression (8%). Leg fracture patients were significantly less anxious but significantly more depressed as compared to the normal subjects. Psychiatric assistance would greatly aid in the management of these patients.
