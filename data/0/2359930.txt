Correction to: British Journal of Cancer (2007) 96, 1139–1146. doi:10.1038/6603689
Owing to an author error, the numbers in the columns headed ‘person years' in Tables 2–4 in the above paper are incorrect. The mean person years should be adjusted by adding 0.8 to each value and the standard deviations should not have been included. All other results are correct.
