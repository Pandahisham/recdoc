An Unusual Case of Abdominal Pain in a Female Child

Non-traumatic abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in emergency department (ED) patients, quoted in some contemporary literature as being the third most frequent reason for ED visits. We present the ED and hospital course of an unusual case of an 11 year old female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The admission assessment of this patient was “possible appendicitis versus gastroenteritis”; however, laparatomy revealed a right adnexal torsion. The need for emergency medicine physicians to always include gynecologic and other less common causes in the differential diagnosis and workup of abdominal pain in children is emphasized.
