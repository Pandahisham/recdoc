Cloning and characterization of a cDNA for murine macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP), a novel monokine with inflammatory and chemokinetic properties [published erratum appears in J Exp Med 1989 Dec 1;170(6):2189]

In the course of studies on cachectin/TNF being conducted in our laboratory, a novel macrophage product has been detected and characterized. Termed macrophage inflammatory protein or MIP, this protein appears to be an endogenous mediator of the inflammatory events induced by endotoxin. A cDNA cloned probe for this protein has been isolated from a lambda gt10 phage library prepared from poly(A)+ RNA obtained of endotoxin-induced RAW264.7 cells. The sequence codes for a 92 amino acid-long polypeptide, of which 69 amino acids correspond to the mature product. The sequence predicts a molecular weight of 7,889 and structural analysis of the protein indicates a characteristic signal sequence alpha-helix and a hydrophobic core. Sequence data also confirm no sequence similarity to any other protein listed in the Dayhoff data base.
