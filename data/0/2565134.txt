Fetal Rat Cerebellar Fragment Transplantation into Adult Rat Forebrain Lesion Cavities

Fragments of fetal rat cerebellar tissue weregrafted into forebrain cortical lesion cavities ofadult rats. After a survival ranging from 12-151days, no graft was found to fill the cavitycompletely. Large neurons, occasionally groupedinto nests, were identifiable from the 22nd day.Myelinated graft fibers, first seen at 32 days,failed to enter host brain. Although graftsdemonstrated elements resembling cerebellartissue, overall organization did not resemble thatof the cerebellum.
