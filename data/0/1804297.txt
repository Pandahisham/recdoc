Background. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by an accelerated turnover of epidermal cells and an incomplete differentiation in epidermis with lesion. However, the exact etiology of psoriasis is unknown. Abnormalities in essential fatty acid metabolism, free radical generation, lipid peroxidation, and  release of lymphokines have been proposed. Objective.  Our purpose was to evaluate the plasma lipids and oxidized low-density lipoprotein accumulation in psoriatic skin lesion in order to ascertain the possible participation of oxidative stress and oxidative modification of lipids in pathogenesis of psoriasis. Methods. The study group included 84 patients with psoriasis, and 40 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. Blood lipid profile was determined. Psoriatic and nonlesional skin samples of psoriatic patients were evaluated for the presence of oxidized low-density lipoprotein by using an immune-fluorescent staining method. Results. The mean levels of lipids (total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol) in patients with psoriasis were found to be significantly higher than those of healthy subjects.  Psoriatic skins were shown positive oxidized low-density lipoprotein staining. There was no staining in nonlesional skin samples of the same individuals. Conclusion. Lipid peroxidation mediated by free radicals is believed to be one of the important causes of cell membrane destruction and cell damage. This study shows for the first time the accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in psoriatic skin lesion. We believe that accumulation of ox-LDL in psoriatic skin may have an important role in the immune-inflammatory events that result in progressive skin damage.

The etiology of psoriasis is unknown, but genetic, metabolic, andimmunologic mechanisms have been proposed [1]. It is known that psoriasis can occur due to abnormalities in essential fatty acid metabolism, lymphokine release, free radical generation, and lipid peroxidation.Alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein composition includinga tendency toward an increase in total cholesterol (TC) andtriglyceride (TG) and decrease in high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C) levels suggest that psoriasis may associatewith the disorders of lipid metabolism [2, 3]. Healthy skinsecretes 85 mg of cholesterol within 24 hours whereas apsoriatic patient loses 1–2 grams of cholesterol with scalesduring that time [1].
The morphology of psoriatic skin is characterized by epidermalthickness and parakeratosis, a pronounced dermal vascular plexus,and the presence inflammatory cells in the superficial dermis andepidermis. Increased polymorph nuclear leukocyte levels damagesurrounding tissue by releasing reactive oxygen species producedvia NADPH oxidase/myeloperoxidase and proteolytic enzymes.Increased production of oxygen metabolites is a common feature ofmost human diseases including psoriasis and it usually triggers anupregulation of the antioxidant capacity, which is overwhelmed.When the oxidative stress develops, it leads to the oxidativedamage of lipids and proteins [2, 4, 5]. Oxidation of thelow-density lipoproteins (LDL) results in the production ofmodified LDL. One of the major and early lipid peroxidationproducts is oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) [6].
High titers of autoantibodies against ox-LDL have been reported inpatients with psoriasis. The level of autoantibodies againstox-LDL has been suggested to reflect the in vivo oxidation of LDL[7, 8]. The presence of ox-LDL accumulation in psoriatic skin sample has not been shown before. The current study has been designed to evaluate the presence of ox-LDL accumulation in skinbiopsy materials of psoriatic patients. We have also measured plasma lipids.
This prospective study was performed in the psoriatic patientsattending the dermatology outpatient clinic of Zonguldak KaraelmasUniversity Hospital. Eighty four psoriatic patients who werediagnosed clinically and histopathologically by the Department ofDermatology and a total of 40 age-and sex-matched healthycontrols recruited from the general population as a control groupwere enrolled in the study. All patients had apparent psoriaticlesions, but no erythroderma or generalized pustulosis. They hadnot taken any medical treatment before. The patients withsecondary hyperlipidemia such as chronic renal insufficiency,nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, obstructiveliver disease, and the connective tissue disease were excluded.All patients and controls were included in the study after givingan informed consent. The Ethics Committee of Zonguldak KaraelmasUniversity approved the study.
The height and weight of all subjects were recorded and their bodymass indexes were calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2).
Blood samples were taken after a 12-hour overnight fast and serawere separated by low-speed centrifugation for 15 min. Thelevels of serum TC, HDL-C, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and TG weredetermined by enzymatic methods using a Roche Cobas Integra 800autoanalyzer.
The skin punch biopsy specimens were collected from both lesionaland nonlesional skin of 84 psoriatic patients. Uninvolvedabdominal area was used as nonlesional skin sample. The presenceof ox-LDL in biopsy materials of psoriatic individuals wasevaluated using an immune-fluorescent staining method. The slideswere prepared from biopsy sections, which were cut at 7-micronthickness. Slides were further divided into two pieces; one wasused for the test and the other was used for negative control.Thirty μl anti-oxidized LDL IgG solution (mouse IgG2antibodies, AntibodyShop, Copenhagen, Denmark) as primary antibodywas added only on test slides, and the control slides weremanipulated only with the same amount of phosphate buffered salinesolution (PBS). After 30 minutes of incubation in a humid chamberat room temperature, both the control and test slides were washedwith (PBS), and 30 μl FITC (fluorescentisothiocyanate)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (ChemiconInternational, California, USA) was administered as aconjugate substance. For a further 30 minutes, the slides were kept andincubated at room temperature, and then washed with the standardPBS solution. After open-air drying, slides were examined underfluorescent microscopy at 100X magnification (LEICA DMRX, Wetzlar,Germany).
Data were expressed as the means and standard deviations (SD).Differences in continuous variables between the patient and thecontrol groups were analyzed using the Student t-test.Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare nonparametric variablesbetween two groups. SPSS Windows release 11.5 was used. Allvalues were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD)unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance level was set to.05 for all calculations.
Table 1 illustrates the clinical and demographiccharacteristics of the study population. There was nostatistically significant difference between psoriatic patientsand the controls considering age, sex, weight, height, or BMI(P > .05).
The levels of the lipid parameters are shown inTable 2. TC, TG, and LDL-C levels were significantlyhigher, but HDL-C levels were lower in the psoriatic patients thanin the control subjects. However, gender-related results werecompletely different. HDL-C levels were significantly lower in thefemale psoriatic patients than in the female control subjects(P < .05). There was no statistically difference for TC, TG, andLDL-C levels between the psoriatic and the control subjects in thefemale group (Table 3). TC, TG, and LDL-C levels weresignificantly higher in the male psoriatic patients than in themale control subjects (P < .05). There  was nostatistically difference in HDL-C levels between thepsoriatic and the control subjects in male group(Table 4).
We did not observe any positive immune-fluorescent staining in thenonlesional skin biopsy materials of the psoriatic patients.Significant positive immune-fluorescent staining was observed inthe psoriatic skin biopsy materials. The dense cellular stainingwas observed in upper epidermis (Figure 1).
Among the many studies on serum lipid values in psoriasis,conflicting results have been reported. In studies on serum TClevels in psoriatic patients, high [2, 9, 10], low [1, 11],and normal [12, 13] values have all been reported. In ourstudy, we found significantly higher levels of TC values in thepsoriatic patients (P < .05). As for serum LDL-C levels, high[2] or normal [1, 10, 12] values have also been reported in psoriasis. We found that LDL-C values in the patients with psoriasis were significantly higher than the control group(P < .05). Normal [9, 10, 13] and low [1, 2] serum levels of HDL-C have been detected. In our study HDL-C levels inpsoriatic patients were significantly lower than the control group(P < .01).
The same controversy exists regarding serum TG levels, high[1, 2], low [11], and normal [9, 10, 12] values have also been reported in psoriasis. We found that TG values in thepsoriatic patients were significantly higher than the controlgroup (P < .001).
The variety of data presented may be due to the fact that thepatients included in statistical analyses suffer from differentforms of psoriasis such as erythroderma and they undergo varioustreatments. Our patients had no  erythroderma orgeneralized pustulosis. Furthermore they had not taken any medicaltreatment.
Our results were strongly related to the gender of the patients.TC, TG, and LDL-C levels were significantly higher in the malepsoriatic patients than in the male control subjects. There was nostatistically difference in the female groups. Only for thefemales, HDL-C levels were lower in the psoriatic patients than inthe control subjects. There was no difference in the male groupsfor HDL-C levels. Considering the results of our research we wouldsuggest analyzing the lipid profiles separately in males andfemales.
The relationship between augmented LDL-C level and psoriasis isunclear. However, ox-LDL may be more illuminative than nativeLDL. Native LDL is only taken up modestly by macrophages, whereasmodified LDL is rapidly taken up via scavenger receptors[14]. The major modification of LDL particles in vivo is believed to be the oxidation of both its lipid and proteincomponents [15]. Oxidized or modified LDLs are the main subjects of many inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis.The oxidized LDL hypothesis is discovered by Goldstein et al. [16] and modified by Steinberg et al. [17]. The current oxidative modification or stress hypothesisof atherosclerosis predicts that LDL oxidation is an early,essential event in atherosclerosis and that ox-LDL does contributeto both initiation and progression of atherosclerosis [18]. The oxidative modification hypothesis focuses on the concept thatLDL in its native form is not atherogenic. The presence of ox-LDLin atherosclerotic lesions has been studied using antibodies thatrecognize specific epitopes on ox-LDL, which are not present inits native, nonoxidized, form. These antibodies avidly stainatherosclerotic lesions in humans with no demonstrable staining innormal arteries [19].
A typical feature of atherosclerosis is the accumulation ofoxidatively modified LDLs within plaques. Also these lipoproteinsare considered to contribute to the inflammatory state ofatherosclerosis and to play a key role in its pathogenesis[20]. The cellular uptake of ox-LDL leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [21]. ROS are potentially very harmful substances, because they can react with proteins,DNA, or lipids. In other words, the accumulation of ox-LDL can bestarter of oxidative stress.
The importance of this manuscript is to show the existence ofox-LDL in psoriatic skin. This study shows for the firsttime the accumulation of oxidized low-density lipoprotein inpsoriatic skin lesions by direct immune-fluorescent method. Ox-LDLor anti-ox-LDL antibody levels can be measured in blood samples orbody fluids by conventional biochemical and immunological methods.Especially, the level of anti-ox-LDL has been suggested to reflectthe in vivo oxidation of LDL. The studies of Vanizor Kural [3] and Örem [7]have demonstrate the existence of these antibodies in psoriasis. Thelevel of anti-ox-LDL antibody was positively correlated with TCand negatively correlated with HDL-C in their studies. In ourstudy, we detected accumulation of ox-LDL in psoriatic skin. Thisaccumulation is markedly increased especially in upper epidermis.The upper-epidermal cells had dens cellular staining withanti-ox-LDL antibodies. Basal layer of epidermis was not stained.We did not observe any positive immune-fluorescent staining in thenonlesional skin biopsy materials of the psoriatic patients. Lerenet al. have observed that tissue-cultered skin fibroblasts frompsoriatic patients have reduced LDL receptor activity [22]. Their study has no difference in LDL receptor activity betweeninvolved and uninvolved skin from our psoriasis patients. In ourstudy, we only focused on the epidermal layer of involved anduninvolved skin from psoriatic patients. We detected accumulationof ox-LDL in the upper epidermis of the involved skin from thepsoriatic patients. Ox-LDL can use native LDL receptor. However,it has a high-affinity advantage than its native form.
In conclusion, ox-LDL is an important marker of oxidative stressand lipid peroxidation process. Importantly, ox-LDL, by itself,may induce inflammation [23]. This capability may directly affect psoriatic epidermis and we believe that the accumulation ofox-LDL in the psoriatic skin may have an important role inpathogenesis of psoriasis.
