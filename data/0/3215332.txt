It gives very soothing feeling that AYU is entering in 31st year of its academic journey from the time of its inception. It has faced lots of ups & down qualitatively & quantitatively during this journey. Tremendous improvement has taken place since Journey 2006 when in the leadership of the then Vice Chancellor Prof. S.S. Savrikar, the AYU was upgraded as a peer reviewed journal which received appreciation from all academic corners. Now as per the approval of the Governing Body of the institute – The Board of Post Graduate Teaching & Research, the journal is being published by highly professionals – the Medknow Publications, Mumbai with the objectives to make further advances and qualitative improvements.
The present issue of ‘AYU’ includes articles from various specialities and disciplines: Standardization - 2, Clinical research – 12, Pharmacological research – 1, Pharmaceutical – 2, Review articles – 5 and one book review. It is expected that the readers at large will be benefitted by the content and new presentation of the journal. AYU has achieved the present status due to all round support from our authors, referees, members of Editorial & Advisory Board of the journal and also time to time guidance and suggestions from the officials of the Dept. of AYUSH, Ministry of Health & F.W., Govt. of India, New Delhi, and of course the readers.
I am sure joint efforts of all of us will make our task easier to achieve the heights of new successes in the field of Ayurvedic education and research through such publications to establish Ayurveda as a evidence based medicine which will ultimately be helpful to develop faith amongst the students, teachers and researchers in this ancient Indian wisdom to make the ailing society healthy and happy.
