EFFICACY OF LITHIUM IN SCHIZOPHRENIA

60 Schizophrenic patients were given LiCo3/Chlorpromazine for 4 weeks, in a double blind cross over study with two placebo crossovers of 1 week before and two weeks after active treatment. Several core schizophrenic features showed significant reduction in severity with lithium. However, CPZ treatment was superior in terms of improvement, as compared to the other group on MBPRS and CGIS. Target symptoms may be one situation, where lithium could be tried and these results are discussed.
