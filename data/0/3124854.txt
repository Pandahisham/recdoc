The quest for targeted delivery in colon cancer: mucoadhesive                    valdecoxib microspheres

The aim of the present study was to prepare valdecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase-2                    enzyme inhibitor, as a loaded multiparticulate system to achieve site-specific                    drug delivery to colorectal tumors. Film coating was done with the pH-sensitive                    polymer Eudragit S100 and sodium alginate was used as mucoadhesive polymer in                    the core. The microspheres were characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential                    scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and were                    evaluated for particle size, drug load, in vitro drug release, release kinetics,                    accelerated stability, and extent of mucoadhesion. The coated microspheres                    released the drug at pH 7.4, the putative parameter for colonic delivery. When                    applied to the mucosal surface of freshly excised goat colon, microspheres                    pretreated with phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 30 minutes showed mucoadhesion. To                    ascertain the effect of valdecoxib on the viability of Caco-2 cells, the                    3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test was conducted                    using both valdecoxib and coated microspheres. In both cases, the percentage of                    dehydrogenase activity indicated a lack of toxicity against Caco-2 cells in the                    tested concentration range. Drug transport studies of the drug as well as the                    coated microspheres in buffers of pH 6 and 7.4 across Caco-2 cell monolayers                    were conducted. The microspheres were found to exhibit slower and delayed drug                    release and lower intracellular concentration of valdecoxib.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy and the fourth most frequent                cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with 945,000 estimated new cases and 492,000                deaths per year in industrialized countries, where the lifetime incidence of the                disease is 5%.1 Development                of colorectal cancer is reported to be associated with multiple factors, which                include, among others, acquired and inherited genetic susceptibility, environmental                elements, and lifestyle choices.2                Chronic ulcerative colitis, particularly when it involves the entire large                intestine, predisposes individuals to colorectal cancer at a rate that is 4- to                20-fold greater than average.3                There are three specific patterns in which colon cancer is generally observed:                sporadic, inherited, and familial. Although the majority of cases of colon cancer                are sporadic in nature, as many as 10% of cases are thought to be                hereditary. The two most common forms of hereditary colon cancer are the familial                adenomatous polyposis and the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, both of                which result from a specific germline mutation.4
Studies have consistently demonstrated that regular use (at least two doses per week)                of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with a reduced risk                of colorectal cancer.5 The                conventional NSAIDs, such as aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and others, are                reported to inhibit both the COX-1 and COX-2 forms of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase                (COX). The COX-1 enzyme is required for physiological processes such as maintenance                of gastrointestinal mucosa and platelet aggregation. However, the potential                mechanisms by which these NSAIDs exert their protective effects in colorectal cancer                appear to be linked primarily to their inhibition of the enzyme COX-2 and                free-radical formation. COX-2 overex-pression is seen in precancerous and cancerous                lesions in the colon and is associated with a decrease in colon cancer cell                apoptosis, as well as enhanced production of angiogenesis-promoting factors.6 However, the dual COX inhibitory                effect of the conventional NSAIDs results in gastrointestinal side effects, and                hence these are not recommended to be used in the prevention of colorectal cancer.                Specific inhibitors of the enzyme COX-2, such as valdecoxib and celecoxib, are quite                selective in their action and hence are recommended for the treatment of colorectal                cancer. However, some recent reports have focused on the cardiac toxicity of these                COX-2 inhibitors, and the use of celecoxib, valdecoxib, and rofecoxib has been shown                to be related to an increased risk of myocardial infarction.7 On the other hand, in the APC (Adenoma Prevention                with Celicoxib) trial, which was cosponsored by the National Cancer Institute and                Pfizer Inc. of New York, it has been shown that cardiovascular problems associated                with COX-2 inhibitors are more likely to occur with patients with previous                cardiovascular problems, and their use is recommended for chemoprevention in                patients without cardiovascular risks.8,9
Targeted delivery to the colon is an attempt to delay the release of the drug into                the colon in order to achieve a high local concentration while reducing the dose and                thus undue side effects of the drug. Researchers have reported alkaline pH                (∼8.0) of colonic contents in patients suffering from colon cancer.10–12 These specific pH conditions of the colonic                region may enhance the chances to successfully deliver the drug to the region by                developing a suitable pH-dependent system.13–15                Moreover, dosage forms with mucoadhesive properties may prolong the residence time                at the site of drug absorption. Mucoadhesive microparticulates coated with a                pH-dependent polymer are proposed to initiate the release of the drug at the                putative colonic pH 7–8.
Microspheres of valdecoxib (a COX-2 inhibitor) dispersed in a matrix of sodium                alginate and subsequently coated with Eudragit S100 (copolymer of methacrylic acid                and methyl methacrylate, a pH-sensitive polymer) were prepared. Characterization of                the microspheres was carried out by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,                X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning                electron microscopy (SEM). The microspheres were evaluated for mucoadhesion, in                vitro drug release in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, and stability of the                formulations. Drug transport studies of valdecoxib and its coated microspheres were                conducted to assess the permeability of the drug across the biological membranes                using Caco-2 monolayers. Also, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium                bromide test was performed to assess the toxicity of valdecoxib to Caco-2 cells in                concentrations intended to be used in transport studies.
Valdecoxib and Eudragit S100 were gifts from Aarti Drugs Ltd (Thane, India) and                    Evonik Industries (Mumbai, India), respectively. The following ingredients used                    in the studies were of analytical grade: sodium alginate (molecular weight:                    198.11) and Span 80 (Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India); light liquid                    paraffin, calcium chloride, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), potassium dihydrogen                    phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium hydroxide (Merck Specialities                    Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India); petroleum ether (RFCL Ltd, New Delhi, India); ethanol                    (Changshu Chemical, China); methanol (SD Fine Chem Ltd, Mumbai, India);                    isobutanol and hydrochloric acid (Merck K GaA, Darmstadt, Germany);                    3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT),                    4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), bovine serum albumin                    (BSA), 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), and sodium dodecyl sufate                    (SDS) (Sigma-Aldrich Labochemikalien GmbH, Germany); and Hank’s buffered                    salt solution(HBSS) 10x (GIBCO batch 699997). Acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich                    Labochemikalien GmbH) was high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)                    grade.
Core microspheres of valdecoxib in varying drug polymer ratios                    (VSA1–VSA5), as shown in Table 1, were prepared following previously published methods.16–18 In a typical experiment, a defined quantity                    of valdecoxib was dispersed in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations of                    sodium alginate in accordance with a drug polymer ratio as in Table 1. Subsequently, the                    dispersion was emulsified in light liquid paraffin containing 2% v/v                    Span 80, with the help of a mechanical stirrer (Remi Instruments Ltd, Mumbai,                    India) at 2000 rpm for 1 hour. A specified volume of the calcium chloride                    solution (5% w/v in IPA) (polymer CaCl2 ratio 1:1) was then                    added to the emulsion at a rate of 2 mL/min and the emulsion was stirred for 10                    more minutes. Microspheres were collected by filtration and washed three times                    with petroleum ether to remove the residual liquid paraffin. Microspheres were                    kept in a deep freezer at −50°C for 10 hours and then kept in a                    vacuum desiccator for 12 hours.
Selected formulations of core microspheres were coated with two different                    concentrations of Eudragit S100 viz. core coat ratio 1:2.5 and of 1:5 (VSAE-1                    and VSAE-2, respectively). Thus, core microspheres were dispersed in Eudragit                    S100 solution (10% w/v) in methanol at room temperature followed by                    emulsification in light liquid paraffin containing 2% Span 80 in a                    beaker, with the help of a mechanical stirrer (1500–2000 rpm). Stirring                    was continued for 3 hours at room temperature in order to evaporate the solvent                    completely. Encapsulated microspheres were filtered and washed with petroleum                    ether to remove the liquid paraffin and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 24                    hours.
FTIR spectra of selected microspheres were recorded using a FTIR                        spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer model 1600-FTIR) in the range of                        4000–400 cm−1.
X-ray diffractograms of the selected microspheres were recorded using an                        X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert Pro, PW 3050/PW 3071; Lelyweg, the                        Netherlands) using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation (λ                        = 1.540598A°) generated at 40 kV and 30 mA and scanning rate                        2°/min over a 2θ range of                        10°–80°.
Thermal analysis of selected microspheres was performed using a DSC-TA system                        (Perkin Elmer). All samples were sealed in a crimped aluminum pan by                        application of the minimum possible pressure and heated at a rate of                        10°C/min from 40°C to 260°C in a nitrogen                        atmosphere. An empty aluminum pan was utilized as the reference pan.
The shape and surface characteristics of selected microspheres were analyzed                        by SEM (ZEISS EVO Series Model EVO50 with a spatial resolution of 2.5 nm).                        Samples mounted on an aluminum stub were sputter coated with gold under                        reduced pressure and a 30–40 nm thick gold coat was applied using                        BIO-RAD POLARAN sputter coater. The sample assembly was placed in the                        microscope and vacuum was applied. The microspheres were observed under SEM                        at an accelerating voltage of 15KV.
The particle size distribution of the coated microspheres was determined                        using a Particle Size Analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Model                        90Plus). The weighed microspheres (20 mg) were suspended in double-distilled                        water and the dispersion was examined to determine particle size                        distribution.
Accurately weighed core microspheres equivalent to 20 mg of the valdecoxib were                    dissolved in 100 mL ethanol and subjected to centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10                    minutes. The supernatant solution was withdrawn and diluted with ethanol to a                    concentration ≈20 μg/mL. Absorbance of the resulting solution                    was measured at 244 nm in an ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV                    Pharmaspec 1700), and the drug content in microspheres was determined. The same                    procedure was followed for measuring drug content in the coated microspheres                    using 100 mg of coated microspheres. The following formulae were employed for                    the calculation of percentage drug loading and drug loading efficiency: Drug loading (%)=DM/WM×100where DM is drug                    contents in microspheres and WM is weight of                    microspheres.
Accurately weighed core microspheres equivalent to 2 mg of valdecoxib were                        suspended in 20 mL of 7.4 pH phosphate buffer containing 1.5% w/v                        SDS. The mixture was stirred magnetically at 37°C at 50 rpm. Samples                        were withdrawn at specified time intervals with volume replacement. The                        withdrawn samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm; supernatant was filtered                        through 0.45 μm membrane filter, diluted to 10 mL with phosphate                        buffer pH 7.4, and analyzed for drug content by measuring absorbance at 244                        nm in a UV spectrophotometer. All the experiments were conducted in                        triplicate.
Accurately weighed coated microspheres equivalent to 2 mg of drug were placed                        in 20 mL 0.01 N hydrochloric acid (pH 2.0) and stirred magnetically at 50                        rpm for 2 hours. The samples were centrifuged and supernatant filtered                        through 0.45 μm membrane filter and analyzed for the drug content as                        described previously.
In a similar experiment, coated microspheres equivalent to 2 mg of drug were                        placed in 20 mL of phosphate buffer containing 1.5% w/v SDS and                        stirred magnetically at 50 rpm. The initial pH of the buffer was maintained                        at 5.5 for 2 hours, which was increased by the addition of                            Na2HPO4 to 6.8 and maintained for 2 hours.                        Subsequently, the pH of the buffer was raised by further addition of                            Na2HPO4 to 7.4 and maintained until the completion                        of study. Hourly, 1 mL of the sample was withdrawn, and each withdrawn                        sample was replaced with fresh release medium. The samples were centrifuged                        and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45 μm filter and analyzed                        for drug content as described previously. All the experiments were run in                        triplicate.
The in vitro drug release data from microspheres were compared by statistical                        analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Student’s                            t-test was performed to compare the significance of the                        difference between the means of two groups. P <                        0.05 was considered significant.
The in vitro wash-off test as reported by Lehr et al19 was followed for the determination of                    mucoadhesion of microspheres. The proximal large intestine of freshly                    slaughtered goat was cut to expose the mucosal surface and washed with distilled                    water and phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The serosal side (2 cm × 2 cm) was                    fixed with the help of thread on a glass slide. Coated microspheres (5 mg) were                    spread on the exposed mucosal surface and rinsed with phosphate buffer pH 7.4                    and the assembly was kept in a humidity chamber (Thermotech, India, Model                    TH-7004) at 37°C and 90% relative humidity (RH) for a period of                    30 minutes. This pretreatment was performed to dissolve the Eudragit S100 coat                    and to expose the core alginate polymer. Subsequently, the complete assembly was                    mounted onto the tablet disintegration test apparatus (Veego, India, model                    VTD-AVP) with the help of a clamp and a thread. The apparatus was operated in                    such a manner that the tissue moved regularly up and down at a frequency of                    28–32 cycles per minute while immersed in the phosphate buffer pH 7.4                    contained in a 1000 mL beaker. The time for complete wash-off of microsphere                    from the tissue was considered the mucoadhesion time.
Protocols for culturing Caco-2 cells were as previously described.20,21 Caco-2 cells of passage 29 were seeded onto                    Transwell inserts (1.12 cm2, 0.4 μm pore size, 105                    cells per insert), and all the experiments of transport studies were conducted                    at day 28 after seeding.
For the purpose of conducting the MTT test, approximately 4 ×                        104 suspended cells were seeded into each of 96 wells in                    enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (MicroWells, Nunk, Denmark). The cells                    were then cultured under standard conditions for 20–24 hours before                    use.
In order to assess the toxicity of valdecoxib and its coated microspheres to                        Caco-2 cells, an MTT test was conducted on the Caco-2 cell monolayers as                        described by Anderberg and Artursson.22 The test is based on the principle that                        the enzyme dehydrogenase in the mitochondria of living cells converts the                        yellow MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]                        2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to a blue–purple formazan                            crystal.23 If the                        cells are exposed to adverse treatment affecting their viability, the                        activity of the dehydrogenase enzyme is compromised.
Valdecoxib solutions and the coated microspheres were tested in eight                        concentrations (0.318–31.8 nM/mL). All the solutions were prepared a                        day before the experiment in HBSS. SDS (concentration ranging from 0.05                        mM/mL to 5.0 mM/mL) was included as a positive control, and blank HBSS                        served as a negative control. HBSS was placed in cell-free wells as an                        additional background control.
On the day of the experiment, the cells were examined under microscope to                        ensure that they were attached to the bottom of the wells. The medium was                        discarded and the test solutions, positive, negative, and background                        controls, were transferred to the 96-well tray. All solutions were tested in                        triplicate. The tray was incubated at 37°C on a shaker table at 100                        rpm (Edmund Bühler GmbH) for 4 hours. Next, the wells were emptied                        and 100 μL of HBSS was added to all the wells along with 20                        μL MTT solution (5 mg/mL). The tray was wrapped in tin foil and                        incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C and 100 rpm (on the shaker table).                        At this time, insoluble blue–purple formazan crystals formed.                        Subsequently, 100 μL of solvent containing SDS (11%w/v),                        isobutanol (50%v/v), and 0.02 N hydrochloric acid (50%v/v)                        was added to all the wells, and the tray was again wrapped in tin foil and                        set aside on a shaker table at 37°C overnight, to allow dissolution                        of the blue–purple crystals. On the following day, the absorbance                        was measured at 595 nm using a plate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MS).
The transport of valdecoxib across the Caco-2 cell monolayer was determined                        using HBSS as a medium supplemented with 1% BSA and 10 mM MES (pH                        6.0; 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid) or 10 mM HEPES                        (pH 7.4; 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid). Before                        initiation of experiments and after the completion of the experiment, the                        barrier properties of the Caco-2 monolayers were assessed by transepithelial                        electrical resistance (TEER) measured at room temperature (25°C) in                        a tissue resistance measurement chamber (EndOhm) with a voltmeter (EVOM),                        both of which were from World Precision Instruments (Sarasota, FL). The cell                        monolayers were rinsed once in prewarmed HBSS, placed on a shaking plate,                        and heated to 37°C. The apical side was filled with 500 μL                        of drug solution (10 μg/mL or 31.81 nmol/ml) prepared in the                        aforementioned medium, and the basolateral side was filled with 1 mL of the                        medium. Samples (100 μL) from the apical solution were withdrawn at                        the start and end of the assays. Samples (100 μL) from the                        basolateral solution were withdrawn regularly at 30-minute intervals and                        replaced each time with the same amount of fresh buffer. Sampling was                        conducted for a period of 120 minutes for the valdecoxib drug solution and                        for a period of 240 minutes for the valdecoxib microspheres, in anticipation                        of the longer time required for drug release from them, as inferred from the                        in vitro drug release results. Transport of valdecoxib from solution and                        microspheres was investigated at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4. All the experiments                        were performed in triplicate.
Estimation of the intracellular contents of the drug after the transport                        study was conducted by washing the cells along with supporting membrane                        twice with HBSS buffer and subsequent air-drying. Further, the individual                        supporting membrane, along with cells, was scraped out using a sharp scalpel                        and was kept in plastic centrifuge vials prefilled with 1 mL acetonitrile.                        All the centrifuge vials were swirled for 10 minutes and then centrifuged                        (Biofuge-15, Heraeus-Sepatech) at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant                        from all the vials was subjected to drug content analysis by HPLC.
Samples were transferred to HPLC vials and frozen until further analysis. The                        samples were analyzed using a method reported by Fronza et al24 using a Merck-Hitachi                        HPLC system, with pump (L-7100), auto-sampler (L-7200), interface D-7000, UV                        detector L-7400, and column oven L-7350.
In order to assess long-term stability, three different batches of formulations                    for VSAE-2 were subjected to stability studies as per International Conference                    on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Coated microspheres were wrapped in aluminum                    foil laminated on the inside with polyethylene. The samples were kept at                    40°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% in a                    stability chamber (Scope Enterprises, Delhi, India) for a period of 6 months.                    Samples were withdrawn after an interval of 15 days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180                    days and were analyzed for drug content.
FTIR spectra of the drug valdecoxib, sodium alginate, Eudragit S100, and the                        coated microspheres are presented in Figure 1. FTIR spectrum of the pure                        valdecoxib showed characteristic peaks at 3377 cm−1 and                        3250 cm−1 due to N-H stretching of sulfonamide and at                        1334 cm−1 and 1150 cm−1 due to                        S═O stretching vibrations of sulfonamide. The spectrum of Eudragit                        S100-coated microspheres of valdecoxib containing sodium alginate showed                        peaks at 3377 cm−1 and 3250 cm−1 due                        to valdecoxib, at 1728 cm−1 due to Eudragit S100, at 1620                            cm−1 due to sodium alginate, and at 1334                            cm−1 and 1155 cm−1 due to                        valdecoxib and Eudragit S100.
X-ray diffractograms (Figure                            2) of valdecoxib indicated the presence of a crystalline material                        with principal peaks at 22.45° and 24.35° 2θ,                        whereas both the polymers sodium alginate and Eudragit S100 were found to be                        amorphous. Although the diffractogram of core microspheres of valdecoxib                        demonstrated the presence of crystalline drug embedded in the amorphous                        polymer, the diffractogram of coated microspheres showed an amorphous                        material devoid of any crystallinity. This could be attributed to a dilution                        effect by the amorphous polymers.
DSC thermograms of the drug, polymers, and microspheres are presented in                            Figure 3. Pure                        valdecoxib exhibited a melting endotherm at 174.25°C. However,                        thermograms of the coated microspheres demonstrated a depressed, relatively                        broad endotherm at 168.38°C, which could be attributed to the                        dilution effect of the amorphous polymers.
SEM of core valdecoxib microspheres in sodium alginate (Figure 4) revealed mostly spherical,                        rough-surfaced microspheres, the rough surface being indicative of the                        surface-associated drug crystals. On the other hand, SEM of the coated                        microspheres of valdecoxib in sodium alginate revealed mostly spherical and                        smooth-surfaced microspheres. The average diameter of the coated                        microspheres in sodium alginate was found to be 35.59 μm                        (22.67–46.51 μm).
The drug loading efficiency of various formulations is presented in Table 1. Retrofit analysis of                    the data reveals that increasing the drug polymer ratio from 1:5 to 1:15                    resulted in an increased drug loading efficiency. However, the extent of the                    increase was not substantial beyond the drug polymer ratio 1:10. Hence, it was                    kept constant, and the quantity of drug and polymer were varied for compositions                    VSA-1, VSA-4, and VSA-5. Composition corresponding to composition VSA-1 was                    utilized for further studies incorporating coating with Eudragit S100 polymer in                    the core:coat ratio of 1:2.5 (VSAE-1) and 1:5 (VSAE-2). The drug loading                    efficiency in core micro-spheres of VSA-1 was 83.80% ±                    1.62%, which is comparable with that of the core microspheres of                    chitosan, where it was 80.33% ± 2.24%, as reported in a                    previous publication.18
The in vitro release profiles of microspheres containing varying ratios of                        drug:sodium alginate as core, are presented in Figure 5. ANOVA showed that there was no                        significant difference in the rate and extent of drug release from the                        formulations VSA1, VSA4, and VSA5                            (P > 0.05), indicating that changing the                        quantity of polymer (sodium alginate) and drug, keeping their ratio                        constant, does not change the in vitro release profile of the microspheres.                        ANOVAs of VSA1, VSA2, and VSA3 indicated                        the significant difference in rate and extent of drug release                            (P < 0.05). The t-test                        indicated that rate and extent of drug release of VSA1 ≠                            VSA2 ≠ VSA3. The difference may be                        attributed to the change in density of the polymer matrix and hence the                        diffusional path length.
The in vitro release profile of the coated microspheres in release medium of                        pH 2 revealed the absence of drug release for the 2 hours tested (Figure 6). In release studies                        conducted in phosphate buffer (Figure 6), where the pH was gradually increased from 5.5 to 6.8,                        the drug release was negligible. However, as the pH of the release medium                        was raised beyond 7, the drug was released into the medium. This was                        expected, as Eudragit S100, an enteric copolymer made of methacrylic                        acid-methyl methacrylate, dissolves at a pH > 7. As the release                        medium pH was increased to 7.4, VSAE-1 microspheres showed around                        12% drug release in a period of 2 hours against 4% drug                        release by VSAE-2. The amount of coating in VSAE-2 was larger, hence it took                        longer time to dissolve, as increased thickness of coating in tablets is                        known to affect oral bioavailability. However, 88% of the drug in                        VSAE-1 and 84% of that in VSAE-2 were found to be released at pH 7.4                        in around 4.5–5 hours. The total drug release in the present case                        (88% and 84%) is better than that of coated microspheres of                        chitosan, where it was 82% and 79%, as reported                            earlier.18
The drug release data obtained from in vitro release experiments were subjected                    to various kinetics equations to evaluate the drug release mechanism and                    kinetics. The kinetic models used were zero order (as cumulative amount of drug                    released versus time), first order (as log cumulative percentage of drug                    remaining versus time),25 and                    Higuchi model (as a cumulative percentage of drug released versus square root of                        time).26 Moreover,                    Hixson–Crowell cube root law27 was used to evaluate the drug release with changes in surface                    area and diameter of the particles while the mechanism of drug release was also                    evaluated by plotting first 60% of drug release in Korsmeyer and Peppas                    (K–P) equation,28 as                    log cumulative percentage of drug released versus log time, and the exponent                    “n” was calculated from the slope of the straight line. The                    release constants and regression coefficients (r2)                    for all the microsphere formulations using different kinetic equations are                    listed in Table 2.
A thorough analysis of the table revealed that in vitro release from the sodium                    alginate microspheres was best explained by the Higuchi equation, as the plots                    showed the highest linearity. This explains the reason for the slow diffusion                    rate as the distance for diffusion increases. The value of “n”                    as per the K–P model for all these microspheres was found to lie between                    0.45 and 0.89, the range being indicative of anomalous behavior of drug release,                    where swelling, diffusion, and erosion play an important role.29,30 The coated microspheres, on the other hand,                    demonstrated the first-order release, ie, Fickian kinetics and the value of                    “n” (<0.45) as per the K–P model also complement                    the same. The dissolution data when plotted as per Hixson–Crowell cube                    root law indicated a change in surface area and the diameter of the microspheres                    with progressive dissolution of the matrix as a function of time.
Estimation of in vitro mucoadhesion revealed that the time required for complete                    removal of microspheres from the mucosal tissue was 95 minutes, indicating good                    mucoadhesive properties of alginate. Various polymer characteristics necessary                    for mucoadhesion include the presence of strong hydrogen bonding groups                    (– OH, – COOH), strong anionic charges, high molecular weight,                    sufficient chain flexibility, and surface free energy properties, favoring                    spreading onto mucus.31 The                    interaction between mucoadhesive polymer and mucous membrane can be described by                    the two steps in the adhesion process32 contact stage, where an intimate contact (wetting) occurs between                    mucoadhesive polymer and mucous membrane, and in the consolidation stage, where                    various physicochemical interactions occur to consolidate and strengthen the                    adhesive joint. Alginate is amongst the “first-generation”                    mucoadhesive polymer groups, a group that contains hydrophilic macromolecules                    with numerous hydrogen bond-forming groups.33–35 It is an anionic polymer with numerous                    carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The mucous membrane secretes mucin that is rich in                    sialic acid and hexosamines. Mucin is also made up of sugars with a large number                    of hydroxyl groups. The concentrations of sialic acid and hexosamines are higher                    in mucin secreted by transitional mucosa that is immediately adjacent to colon                    tumor than the mucin secreted by normal mucosa.36 At colonic pH, sialic acid will remain                    deprotonated and will carry a negative charge. The free carboxyl group of                    calcium alginate will also be deprotonated at the said pH and thereby repel the                    negatively charged sialic acid moieties. However, alginic acid also contains a                    large number of hydroxyl groups, which will form hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl                    groups of mucin, imparting mucoadhesion. Similar hydrogen bonding and                    mucoadhesion would also result from amino groups of hexosamines.
Higher concentrations of sialic acid with hydroxyl groups and hexosamines in                    mucin adjacent to colon tumor may lead to higher mucoadhesion and hence a long                    residence time of the alginate microspheres adjacent to the tumor. However, it                    has already been reported that the time required to completely wash-off the                    valdecoxib-containing chitosan microspheres was quite long (162 minutes)18 compared with the similarly                    prepared microspheres of alginate (95 minutes). The better mucoadhesion with                    chitosan microspheres may be attributed to electrostatic attraction between                    positively charged chitosan and negatively charged mucin and also to the                    hydrogen bonding due to the presence of – OH and deprotonated                        –NH2 groups in chitosan.
The color intensities of the wells were used as the measure of survival of                        cells after various treatments. The percentage dehydrogenase activity was                        calculated by the following formula and plotted against the concentration                            (Figure 7): P =                                AT+/AT−                        × 100, where P is the percentage of dehydrogenase activity,                            AT+ is the absorbance of wells with test solution,                        and A T− is the absorbance of wells without test                        solution.
The graph shows that the dehydrogenase activity of the cells with all the                        samples varied from a minimum of 82% to a maximum of 99%,                        indicating the absence of toxicity of valdecoxib and its coated microspheres                        to Caco-2 cells in the concentration range used (0.318–31.8                        nM/mL).
The major mechanism for drug uptake across the intestinal mucosa is passive                        diffusion where the driving force is concentration gradient. Penetration                        through Caco-2 cells is well established as an in vitro model for evaluating                        transcellular transport.
Accordingly, Caco-2 cell monolayer was used as a model for studying the                        cellular uptake of free valdecoxib as well as valdecoxib entrapped in                        microspheres, but cell uptake will only take place if the cells are alive.                        Thus, initially, the cytotoxicity of the free drug as well as drug entrapped                        in microspheres was evaluated in the Caco-2 cell layer (MTT test), and it                        was observed that neither the free drug nor the entrapped drug interferes                        with cell metabolism. In other words, the drug does not have any                        cytotoxicity. The lack of cytotoxicity in Caco-2 cell layer appears to be                        due to diminished expression of COX-2 by the Caco-2 cells.37,38 It will be appropriate to mention here                        that Schiffmann et al39                        did not observe any cytotoxicity of valdecoxib in HCA-7 cells with high                        COX-2 expression. Thus, it is quite obvious that valdecoxib will not show                        any cytotoxicity in Caco-2 cells with diminished COX-2 expression.
The TEER was measured before and after the experiment. A small decrease                        (8%) in the TEER was observed. TEER (mean ± standard                        deviation), before and after experiments, was 269 ± 15 Ω cm                        and 247 ± 34 Ω cm, respectively, indicating that membrane                        integrity was not compromised during the study.
The transport of valdecoxib across Caco-2 cell monolayers was studied under                        four conditions: valdecoxib solutions at pH 6.0 and 7.4 and valdecoxib                        microspheres at pH 6.0 and 7.4. The results (Figure 8) suggest that there was no                        difference between the transport from the drug solutions at pH 6.0 and pH                        7.4, indicating that the change in pH had no effect on the permeability of                        valdecoxib. This is supported by the fact that valdecoxib, a sulfonamide,                        with pKa of 9.8, would remain in a unionized state at either pH. At 120                        minutes the total amount transported from the solutions was 27% and                        31%, respectively. The high degree of transport of valdecoxib is                        supported by a predicted logP of 2.734 and logD of 2.82 at both pH values.                        The transport of valdecoxib from coated microspheres was studied at pH 6.0                        and pH 7.4. Valdecoxib could not be detected in the basolateral chamber when                        the microspheres were suspended in buffer at pH 6.0. This is consistent with                        the in vitro release studies showing that no valdecoxib was released at pH                        < 7.
The transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers from valde-coxib microspheres at                        pH 7.4 was slower than from solutions, probably due to the processes                        involved in hydration and dissolution of the coating layer and diffusion of                        valdecoxib out of the sodium alginate microspheres. Thus, a prolonged and                        sustained release profile was achieved.
The intracellular contents of valdecoxib after transport studies are                        represented in Figure 9. The                        intracellular contents of valdecoxib after transport studies for 120 minutes                        were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at pH 7.4 than                        after transport studies with microspheres for 240 minutes. Thus, the                        microspheres yield a slower release and a lower intracellular content of                        valdecoxib. This indicates that the local delivery of valdecoxib to colon                        cancer cells bypasses the systemic delivery of the drug, and hence reduced                        cardiac side effects are possible by the multiparticulate system                        studied.
Selected formulation VSAE-2 was subjected to accelerated stability studies as per                    climatic zone IV condition for assessing long-term stability as per ICH                    protocol. After storage, the formulations were analyzed for the drug contents                    assay. No significant difference in drug contents was observed in the                    formulation. The degradation rate constant was found to be 6.91E-05                        day−1 and t90% was                    found to be 1534 days, indicating that the said formulation may have a                    shelf-life of more than 3 years.
The present work was aimed at exploitation of pH-sensitive polymer Eudragit S100 for                colon-specific delivery of valdecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, and, further, at achieving                mucoadhesion of the core microspheres by use of mucoadhesive polymer sodium                alginate. The results of the present study indicate that the microspheres prepared                using sodium alginate as a core and subsequently coated with Eudragit S100 could be                used for the colon targeting of drugs. The presence of sodium alginate in the core                imparts mucoadhesion in the colon after the removal of Eudragit coat by the mildly                alkaline pH of colonic contents, which might lead to increased residence time of the                drug in the affected area. The concepts of colon targeting and mucoadhesion have                been tried with mixed results, and one of the reasons for the lack of stellar                results might be that the assumed difference in ileum/colon pH is not large enough.                However, the chances for success might be improved if the higher pH reported around                the tumors means that the pH difference is bigger in colorectal cancer. We believe                that further research efforts are warranted to assess the potential of COX-2                inhibitors in mucoadhesive microspheres targeted to release around colorectal tumors                and eventually to ascertain the efficacy of the formulation in real-life                situations.
