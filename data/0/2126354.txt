THE EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTION IN DOGS OF EMPHYSEMA WITH ASSOCIATED ASTHMATIC SYNDROME BY MEANS OF AN INTRATRACHEAL BALL VALVE

 1. Experimental emphysema can be produced in dogs by impeding expiration by means of a properly constructed ball valve introduced into the trachea. 2. This method affords a practical means of study of various physiological, pathological, and clinical aspects of emphysema. 3. The experiments demonstrate that any lesion or factor capable of interfering sufficiently with proper air expulsion yet permitting of sufficient air intake will occasion emphysema. 4. Attacks simulating those of asthma are occasioned in experimental emphysematous animals after exercise as well as during and following inhalation of mildly irritant gases.
