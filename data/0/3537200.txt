Ball in Chest


A 50-year-old male underwent a check-up for an insurance company. Chest X-ray revealed a large ball-like lesion in the posterior mediastinum. The finding was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan (Figure 1). The patient was referred to our center, where he had a successful mass removal surgery (Figure 2). Pathology identified the mass as neurinoma.
