Evaluation of the Subchronic Toxicity of Dietary Administered                        Equisetum arvense in F344 Rats

Equisetum arvense, commonly known as the field horsetail, has                    potential as a new functional food ingredient. However, little information is                    available on its side effects, and the general toxicity of Equisetum                        arvense has yet to be examined in detail. In the present study, we                    evaluated the influence of administration in diet at doses of 0, 0.3, 1 and 3%                    for 13 weeks in male and female F344 rats. No toxicity was detected with                    reference to clinical signs, body weight, urinalysis, hematology and serum                    biochemistry data and organ weights. Microscopic examination revealed no                    histopathological lesions associated with treatment. In conclusion, the                    no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for Equisetum arvense                    was determined to be greater than 3% in both sexes of F344 rat (males and                    females: >1.79 g/kg BW/day and >1.85 g/kg BW/day, respectively) under the                    conditions of the present study.

                Equisetum arvense, commonly known as the field horsetail, is a                bushy perennial featuring rhizomatous stem formation                    1                . The plant contains abundant minerals such as silicon and calcium                    2                , as well as small amounts of pharmacologically active compounds, and has                been used as a traditional medicine to stop bleeding, heal ulcers and wounds and                treat tuberculosis and kidney diseases. It is available as a dried extract in                powdered form or a liquid extract, and its biological effects include                    anti-oxidant                    3                                ,                                    4                , anti-convulsant and sedative actions                    5                , as demonstrated in recent in vitro and in                    vivo studies. In particular, it is expected to lower high blood                pressure due to its diuretic effect, which was previously observed in rats and                    humans                    6                . Therefore, Equisetum arvense may have potential as new                functional food ingredient. 
Recently, no genetic toxicity of Equisetum arvense was reported in a                reverse mutation test, chromosomal aberration test or micronucleus test                    7                . Additionally, the LD50 value of Equisetum                    arvense was found to exceed 5000 mg/kg in a single-dose toxicity study                in rats                    7                . 
However, it was reported to cause skin dermatitis in people allergic to tobacco                    smoke                    8                . Furthermore, little is known about its side effects when continuously                administered via the oral route. 
In the present study, we therefore examined the general toxicity of Equisetum                    arvense administered in diet for 13 weeks to male and female F344 rats.            
Five-week-old F344 rats (40 males and 40 females) were obtained from Charles                    River Laboratories Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan) and housed in a room maintained                    under a 12-h light/dark cycle at constant temperature (23 ± 1°C) and humidity                    (50 ± 5%). Test chemicals (Lot.183-3194G, Cross Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), a                    yellow-green to yellow fresh powder, were prepared every month from                        Equisetum arvense, extracted with hot water and mixed with                    powdered CRF-1 basal diet (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) at each concentration.                    The diet of each group was changed twice a week during the experiment. 
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee                    of Osaka City University Medical School. After acclimation for 1 week, male and                    female rats at six weeks of age were randomly divided into eight groups of 10                    rats each. Dosage selections were based on estimated intake for humans as                    follows. We expected that people consumed 5 mg/kg Equisetum                        arvense daily as a supplement. To ensure a safety factor of                    100-fold, the 1% dose was set to feed at an approximate dosage level of 500                    mg/kg, and 3 and 0.3% doses were chosen as the high and low dose groups using a                    common ratio of about 3. The animals received diets containing Equisetum                        arvense at doses of 0, 0.3, 1 and 3%, respectively, for 13 weeks.                    They were observed daily for clinical signs and mortality. Body weight and food                    consumption were measured weekly. Fresh urine samples were collected from all                    animals at week 13. Urinalysis using N-multistix SG-L and Clinitek Status                    (Siemens, Tokyo, Japan) was performed for the following parameters: glucose                    (GLU), bilirubin (BIL), ketone (KET), specific gravity (SG), protein (PRO),                    urobilinogen (URO), occult blood (OB), pH and nitrite (NIT). At the end of the                    experiment, all animals were fasted overnight and euthanized by exsanguination                    under ether anesthesia. Blood was taken from the abdominal aorta for hematology                    and serum biochemistry analyses. Hematological examinations included the                    following parameters: white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC),                    hemoglobin concentration (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), platelet count (PLT), mean                    corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular                    hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Serum biochemistry was performed to examine                    total proteins (TP), albumin (ALB), albumin/globulin ratio (A/G), aspartate                    aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase                    (ALP), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), creatinine (CRN), triglycerides                    (TG), total cholesterol (T-Cho), total bilirubin (T-Bil), blood urea nitrogen                    (BUN), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), calcium (Ca) and inorganic                    phosphorus (P). Analyses for hematology and serum biochemistry were conducted at                    Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corp., (Osaka, Japan) using automatic analyzing                    machines, XT-2100 (Sysmex, Hyogo, Japan) and H7700 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), for                    blood and serum analyses, respectively. At sacrifice, the heart, liver, spleen,                    kidneys, adrenals, testes, brain and thymus were excised and weighed. In                    addition to these organs, the lymph nodes (cervical and mesenteric), aorta,                    salivary gland, bone (sternum, femur), bone marrow, trachea, thyroid, tongue,                    esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas,                    urinary bladder, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, epididymis, ovaries, uterus,                    vagina, pituitary gland, sciatic nerve, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, eyes and                    harderian glands were excised and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Testes were                    fixed in Bouin's solution. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of all organs and                    tissues were routinely prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for                    histopathological examination. All organs and tissues in the control and                    high-dose groups were examined. Histopathological examination was also extended                    to all tissues of the low- and medium-dose groups if lesions were frequently                    found in the high-dose group. 
The avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method was used to demonstrate alpha2u-globulin                    expression in the kidney. After deparaffinization, kidney sections were treated                    in a microwave oven sequentially with 3% H2O2, normal                    rabbit serum, goat polyclonal anti- alpha2u-globulin antibody (AF586, R&D                    Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) diluted 1:300, biotin-labeled secondary                    antibody and avidin-biotin complex (Vectastain ABC kit, Funakoshi, Tokyo,                    Japan). Tissue sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Kidney                    tissue sections without addition of primary antibody were used as negative                    controls. For positive controls, kidneys of rats administered KBrO3,                    which is known to increase alpha2u-globulin, were subjected to analysis. 
The Dunnett’s multiple range test was employed for comparison of body weights,                    urinalysis, organ weights (both absolute and relative), hematology and serum                    biochemistry data between the control and treated groups. For all comparisons,                        p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically                    significant (Stat Light, Yukms Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). 
 Body weight changes in F344 rats given Equisetum                                arvense . Symbols represent the means.
No deaths or obvious clinical signs were noted in any of the animals throughout                    the experimental period. During the experiment, the body weights and cumulative                    body weight gains in all treatment groups were similar to those of the controls                        (Fig. 1). The total intake of                        Equisetum arvense (g/rat) for 13 weeks was 0 (0%), 3.8                    (0.3%), 12.3 (1%) and 36.4 (3%) in males and 0 (0%), 2.3 (0.3%), 7.9 (1%) and                    24.2 (3%) in females (Table 1).                    There was no difference in food consumption. 
There were no significant differences in any of the parameters among the groups,                    but the protein levels in the 1 and 3% male groups tended to decrease (Table 2). 
Significant alterations were observed in hematological parameters (Table 3), including increased MCH in                    the 0.3% males, increased PLT in the 1% females and decreased MCH in the 1%                    females (p<0.05), but no dose dependence was apparent. In                    addition, a trend towards a dose-dependent decrease in WBC was found in the                    females. Data for serum biochemistry are shown in Table 4. There were significant decreases in Ca in the                    1 and 3% male groups (p<0.01 and p<0.05)                    and in T-Cho in the 3% males (p<0.05). A trend towards a                    dose-dependent decrease in TG was found in the males. 
Absolute and relative organ weights are summarized in Table 5. There were no significant differences in any                    organ weights. A tendency towards a decrease in the absolute weights of the                    adrenals was observed in the males. 
No treatment-related macroscopic changes were observed in any of the animals at                    sacrifice. Histopathologically, spontaneous inflammatory and proliferative                    lesions in the liver and pancreas, microgranulomas in the liver, atrophy in                    kidneys and cysts in the ovary and pituitary glands were diagnosed. All the                    changes were of minimal grade. Eosinophilic bodies and alpha2u-globulin                    expression in the proximal tubules of the kidneys were observed in all male                    rats, including the 0% group (Fig. 2).                    Extended microscopic examination of kidneys in the 0.3 and 1% male groups showed                    no histopathological changes compared with the 0% group (Table 6). The number of eosinophilic bodies per rat                    among the groups was not significantly different (Fig. 3). Moreover, no treatment-related findings were revealed in                    other tissues and organs of the male or female rats. 
 Eosinophilic body with overexpression of alpha2u-globulin in the rat kidney.                        Kidney sections from male control rats were used to confirm whether                        eosinophilic bodies (arrowheads) were also positive for alpha2u-globulin.                        Some epithelial cells in proximal tubules were positive. a: HE stain. b:                        immunohistochemistry for alpha2u-globulin. Scale bar shows 100                            μm.

In the present study, dietary administration with Equisetum arvense                for 13 weeks was not found to alter body weight in either gender of rat. The decline                of the urine protein levels after administration of Equisetum                    arvense in the 1 and 3% male groups may be related to its diuretic                effect, which was previously reported                    6                . Although the WBC in females and the weights of the adrenals in males were                dose-dependently decreased, no histopathological changes related to inflammation and                atrophy of adrenals were observed. Furthermore, although a significant decrease in                the concentration of serum Ca was noted in the 1 and 3% groups in males, all values                were within the physiological range previously observed in our lab. A significant                decrease in T-Cho and a tendency for decrease in TG were seen in a dose-related                manner in males, but no histopathological changes pointing to altered lipid                metabolism were observed in the liver. 
Histopathological examination of kidneys revealed the existence of intracytoplasmic                granules, diagnosed as eosinophilic bodies, seen in the proximal tubules in all male                groups (Fig. 2a), but not in the female rats.                These granules were demonstrated to be alpha2u-globulin by immunohistochemistry                    (Fig. 2b). Abnormal accumulation of                alpha2u-globulin is known to be related to nephropathy and renal carcinogenesis in                male rats                    9                                ,                                    10                . As no difference in the number of eosinophilic bodies was seen between the                control and treated groups, administration of Equisetum arvense                clearly exerted no effects on the formation of alpha2u-globulin. 
In an earlier toxicological report for rats                    11                , dietary administration of 4% Equisetum arvense with 0.5%                cholesterol and 0.15% sodium cholate for 14 days caused dermatitis of the neck, head                and back skin in about 20-65% of rats, with no significant differences in the serum                IgE levels. However, clinical signs, such as redness and edema, were not observed in                this 13-week dietary administration study. Therefore, it is likely that                    Equisetum arvense alone does not induce dermatitis in rats and                that the changes observed in the earlier study were probably due to coadminstration                of excess amounts of cholesterol and/or sodium cholate with Equisetum                    arvense                                    11                . 
In humans, it was reported that seborrhoeic dermatitis occurred in some patients,                transdermal absorption of Equisetum arvense after passive                inhalation of tobacco smoke                    8                . Smoke components, such as nicotine and formaldehyde are considered to cause                allergic contact dermatitis                    12                . 
However, the results of the present study showed no adverse effects of                    Equisetum arvense when administered alone in diet. Taking into                accounts these reports, we predict that additional factors such as a potential                allergen of tobacco might influence the side effects of Equisetum                    arvense. 
In conclusion, we determined the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for                    Equisetum arvense to be more than 3% in both male and female                rats (males and females: >1.79 g/kg BW/day and >1.85 g/kg BW/day,                respectively) under the conditions of the present study.
