Day-case arteriography.

Outpatient femoral arteriography has been carried out in 100 consecutive patients presenting with evidence of peripheral vascular disease. Patients have been observed for seven hours in an observation ward bed. No bleeding or other complications have been encountered. The cost-saving to the hospital is approximately 60.00 pounds per case. More importantly, the service to patients has been improved, with less chance of last minute cancellation due to unavailability of a surgical bed.
