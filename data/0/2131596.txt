CHEMICAL FINDINGS IN THE BLOOD OF THE DOG AFTER CLOSED-LOOP OBSTRUCTION OF THE JEJUNUM

 The chemical findings in the blood of 6 dogs with closed-loop obstruction of the upper jejunum are reported. The duration of life with closed loops is less than with simple obstruction. All animals showed a marked rise in non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen, and fall in chlorides. Usually the C02 combining power of the plasma is increased. The findings in closed-loop obstruction are essentially the same as in simple intestinal obstruction.
