A 25-year old man presented with a high output external biliary fistula after an operation for a gianthydatid cyst of the liver. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was inadequate to close the fistula. A nasobiliarytube was selectively inserted into the leaking hepatic duct and bile was continuously aspirated. Thefistula and the residual cavity healed completely. Details of the patients' management using thisalternative technique, are discussed.
