Scientific abstracts presented at the International Congress for Clinicians in Complementary & Integrative Medicine 2013
Focus Areas: Integrative Approaches to Care, Pediatrics
This session will focus on an Integrative approach to fertility and preconception care. Women having challenges getting pregnant often rely on integrative therapies to support them through conventional fertility management.
A saying in TCM about fertility is that we must “cultivate the soil before planting the seed.” We will discuss the reproductive cycle as viewed through the lens of TCM and discuss the role of yoga and the plant-based diet in creating an environment for a healthy pregnancy and birth. Specific patient care strategies will be discussed.
