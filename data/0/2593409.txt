The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the long-term followup of soft penile SSDA prosthesis, without plaque surgery in the treatment of Peyronie's disease. This study included 12 men with Peyronie's disease who underwent placement of a penile prosthesis. All patients were followed for at least 6 years. Prosthesis straightened the penile shaft in all cases, restoring patient sexual satisfaction. No operative or postoperative complications occurred, and no reoperations were needed. All patients have undergone further examination with basal and dynamic eco color Doppler. The findings are encouraging as the penis preserves the ability to enhance the tumescence and penile girth. We can conclude that SSDA penile prosthesis is safe and effective in Peyronie's disease.

In 1743, de la Peyronie firstdescribed the characteristic penile curvature, nowadays known as Peyronie's disease or induratio penis plastica  (IPP) [1]. Ingeneral, IPP refers to acquired penile deformities during erection (curvatureand strictures) and/or penile shortening. This condition is usually associatedwith palpable hardening (plaque) on the penile shaft and eventually painfulerection. Current researches suggest that IPP could be a localized connectivetissue disorder affecting the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa.
The aetiology of the disease remains unknownand many hypotheses have been formulated so far. Trauma is thought to be thepromoter factor of IPP, causing mechanical stress and microvascular damage. Asa consequence, even genetically induced, hyperactive wound healing may causechronic inflammation and fibrosis of tunica albuginea with subsequent development of hardening and deformation of the penile shaft characteristic of thestabilized phase of disease.
Another hypothesis is related to a defect ofimmune response causing antibody reaction against the tunica albuginea. IPP canoccur in a familiar pattern and it has been reported in association withDupuytren's disease as well.
Over years, various medical treatments such asradiation, laser therapy, ultrasound, shock wave lithotripsy have been reportedwithout any of them being superior to others. However, surgery is consideredthe only effective treatment for stabilized disease when severe curvature ornarrowing interferes with sexual intercourse [2–4].
Several surgical options have beenproposed. Tunica shortening procedures are performed by reducing the length ofthe convex side of the penis opposite to the penile plaque (Nesbitt or Yachia procedures;plication of corpora cavernosa). Conversely, lengthening techniques areperformed by plaque incision or excision while the resulting defect is thencovered by a graft. As a result, the extension of the short side of the penilecurvature gives the penile shaft the original length [2, 4–6]. Anotherpossible treatment, especially with associated erectile dysfunction, is penileprosthesis placement. These surgical treatments warrant adequate correction of penile curvature andrecovery of patient sexual satisfaction [7–9].
We have treated a patient series byplacing a particular semirigid soft penile prosthesis (silicon soft dynamic antiextrusion(SSDA)) in which the cavernous tissue is displaced by prosthesis shaft as aperipheral layer of cavernous surrounding tissue.
Our hypothesis was that the residualfunction of this cavernous tissue could have a positive impact on penilecurvature treatment and patient satisfaction. We report our retrospective studywith a long-term followup.
Between 1998 and 2001, 12 patients (36 to 67years) (Table 1) were treated by soft penile prosthesis placement (SSDA). All patients presented erectile dysfunction associated with penile deformation. Wepreviously excluded patients with diabetes and vasculogenic impotence. A severepenile shortening was reported in 6 patients. All patients were previously treated byvarious medical and physical therapies without any benefit. In all patients,the plaque was easilypalpable on the penile shaft. Erectile function was tested by duplex dynamic color Dopplerultrasound, nocturnal penile tumescence, and hormone assay.
We reviewed our experience with implants onsoft penile prosthesis called silicon soft dynamic antiextrusion (SSDA) (Figure 1). This prosthesis consists of silicone elastomer which has three zoneswith different features:													thecentral zone has a variable rigidityand size to satisfy different clinical necessities and to permit an easyinsertion;								thedistal zone is made of softer silicone to reduce the risk ofextrusion;								theproximal zone presents a series of slightly cone-shaped segments,with a size of 3 mm, smaller than the central zone, to facilitate the insertioninto corpora cavernosa. It requires less dilatation even in the presence ofsevere fibrosis and can reduce crural pain because of better flexibility [7, 8].

A penoscrotal longitudinal incisionis our preferred surgical approach for SSDA prosthesis placement. Trichotomy isperformed two hours before surgery and short-term antibiotic prophilaxis(Piperacillin 2 gand Netilmicin 150 mg)is administered. The patient is placed in lithotomic position under spinalanaesthesia. We perform a minimal longitudinally corporotomy (<2 cm), oneach corpora cavernosa, and then we place the cylinder with appropriate lengththrough the corporotomy. Routinely, a transurethral catheter is left in placeuntil the first postoperative day. Each patient has been followed up until thesurgical wound had healed and any surgical complications have been recorded indetail. Patients were then taught to manipulate the penile prosthesis and wereallowed to start sexual activity after 6 weeks [10].
All patients underwent an annualclinical assessment. All patients reached a 6 years minimum followup. At thistime, a questionnaire was administered to the patient and his partner. Thequestions regarded the frequency of sexual intercourse per month, theacceptance degree by patient and his partner (range 0–10), and theoverall sexual satisfaction. In order to investigate the postoperative residualfunction of the corpora cavernosa, all patients were evaluated by color Dopplerdynamic ultrasonography (Esaote-Technos, probe 7, 5–10 MHz) before and after taking oral 50 mgSildenafil associated to visual sex stimulation. We measured thickness ofcavernous tissue, peak systolic velocity, and the presence of plaques.
The implantation  of an SSDA prosthesisstraightened the penile shaft in all cases indicating a good surgical outcome  and restored sexual satisfaction. All the patients have been discharged withinthe third postoperative day. We did not have any intraoperative complications.Only one patient had a wound infection without permanent consequences. Nosubsequent postoperative complications were encountered. Only one man reportedless than 1 sexual intercourse in a month, 7 men indicated having 1 to 6 sexualintercourses and 4 men more than 6 sexual intercourses (Table 2). The degree ofacceptance by couple was 7, 2 (range 4–10) for men and7, 8 (range 5–9) for thepartner. The overall sexual satisfaction was positive in 11 patients (Table 3).The color Doppler dynamic  ultrasonography showed a significant thicknessincrease of cavernosal tissue (5 to 9 mm) as well as peak systolic velocityincrease (7.5 cm/sto 16.5 cm/s) after the dynamic phase; no plaques weredetected (Table 4) (Figures 2 and 3; Figures 4 and 5). In all cases, we notedan almost complete straightening of the penile shaft.
The natural history of IPP can besummarized into early and late stages. The early stage is characterized byreactive inflammation with multifocal spreading into the tunica albuginea.Clinically, a palpable nodule or plaque that makes penis deformed in its shapeduring a usually painful erection can be shown. In the second phase, fibrosisand calcification of acute inflammation take place making the plaque hard andsteadily causing a stable penile curvature, stricture, and some gradeshortening during erection. Reduction of both cavernous blood supply and thepossibility of venous leakage due to the rigidity of tunica albuginea may causesome grade of erectile dysfunction.
This histological evolution seems tobe constant, while the progression and timing of disease remain unpredictable. Wedo not have well-defined criteria to establish the end of the process: a quoteof patients indeed presents recurrence after long time. Moreover, in youngerpatients, the course may be more severe [11].
For these reasons, in our opinionthe surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease should be as simple as possible,even considering the possible multifocal spreading of fibrosis. Moreover, inorder to adhere to patient's perspectives, the ideal prosthetic implant shouldprovide a firm and straightened penis, if possible, restoring the originallength or girth of the natural erection [12].
The SSDA soft prosthesis satisfiesall these criteria as it provides a good hardening and girth of the penis,implant is easy to perform, it has low cost and low mechanical failure ratewhile an adequate flexibility warranted by structure, shape, and by intrinsicsilicone characteristics lead to a good patient tolerance and comfort.Moreover, after implantation, the residual cavernous surrounding tissue is keptintact with an adequate cavernous arterial blood flow making possible itsadequate expansion under sexual stimulation. Furthermore, the characteristicsofty tip lowersthe pressure of the prosthetic shaft on the tip of corpora cavernosa withpossible positive impact on pain and eventually on extrusion rate.
Our technique does not include theplaque treatment associated to prosthesis placement. Even in severe penilecurvature, the simple placement of the cylinders makes the penile shaft lesspronounced. Interestingly, we noted that over time the same penile curvature decreases until almostdisappearing. It can be hypothesized that it may be due to continuousmechanical straighten induced by prosthesis associated with residual cavernoustissue function.
A peculiarity of our study is thedynamic study of residual cavernous tissue that gives the basis for a role ofpharmacologic rehabilitative postoperative therapy in order to increasevasoactive response to sexual stimulation and improve patients' satisfaction.
If evaluation of patientsatisfaction might be considered adequate considering the long-term followup,an even longer followup would be needed to rule out any long-term mechanicalfailure as well as spontaneous prosthesis extrusion that did not happen in thepresent study.
Silicon soft dynamic antiextrusionpenile prosthesis is safe and effective in the treatment of severe Peyronie'sdisease associated to penile deformity during erection. Results in terms ofpenile curvature correction are good. The majority of patients report a sexualsatisfaction. Moreover, the positive response to vasoactive drugs by residualcavernous tissue might give the rationale for a pharmacological adjuvantrehabilitation therapy in order to improve the patient satisfaction even inpatients having an insufficient residual cavernous tissue erection.
