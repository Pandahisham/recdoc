STUDIES ON HYPERSENSITIVENESS TO DIPHTHERIA BACILLI 

 The paper describes an "immediate" skin reaction to derivatives of the diphtheria bacillus which is shown to be distinct from the "delayed" or "pseudoreaction" commonly seen in Schick tests on adults. The "immediate" reaction was passively transferred to local areas of the skin of other people.
