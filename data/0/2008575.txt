The Management of Terminal Carcinoma with Oral Potassium Permanganate

Oral potassium permanganate has been used in the management of terminal carcinoma in three patients. Symptomatic improvement occurred in all three, with elimination of oral foetor in one patient and diminished requirement of analgesics in the other two. The mental state of each patient was improved and normal activities were resumed.
