LITHIUM IN AFFECTIVE DISORDERS : A SEVEN YEAR OBSERVATION OF LITHIUM CLINIC

Out of 692 patients registered in the lithium clinic, King George's Medical College, Lucknow, 122 patients suffering from affective disorders, receiving lithium for at least 6 months continuously, having had at least 5 serum lithium estimations done and having been evaluated at least once in 6 months while on follow-up, were analysed with a view to study the relapses. About one-third patients suffered no relapse while on lithium. The study revealed that longer the duration of lithium treatment lesser were the frequency, number, intensity and duration of manic/depressive relapses. Majority of patients were maintained on the lower side (0.5-0.8 mEq/L) of the usually recommended therapeutic range (0.6-1.2 mEq/L) for lithium prophylaxis. Commonly observed side effects include fine tremors, muscular weakness, polyuria, polydipsia and constipation. All the side effects were easily managed and none had a fatal sides-effect. A reappraisal in the light of existing literature of lithium prophylaxis on manic depressive psychosis is done.
