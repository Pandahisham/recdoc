A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SIDE-EFFECTS OF LITHIUM, CARBAMAZEPINE AND HALOPERIDOL IN ACUTE MANIA

In an open trial on manic patients, side-effects of carbamazepine, lithium and haloperidol were evaluated weekly over a 4-week period. The total side-effects with the three drugs were not significantly different, but the rate of amelioration of the same was best for lithium and least for haloperidol. It was indicative that lithium was better tolerated drug than the other two.
