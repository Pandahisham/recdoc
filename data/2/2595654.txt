The Incidence of Carcinoma in Solitary “Cold” Thyroid Nodules

Two hundred and three patients with single thyroid nodules were referred for radioactive scan of the thyroid. Solitary “cold” nodules were identified in 130 patients and 68 of these patients came to surgery. Of this group, 12 patients were found to have carcinoma. There was no obvious selection process which distinguished the 68 patients who underwent surgery from the 62 who did not. There is a significant risk of thyroid neoplasms occurring in patients with solitary “cold” nodules, and this is particularly true in patients under forty.
