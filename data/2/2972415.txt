ONCE DAILY LITHIUM IN THE PROPHYLAXIS OF MOOD DISORDERS

This retrospective chart review attempts to compare the utility, safety and efficacy of once daily (OD) versus divided dose (DD) lithium therapy in the prophylaxis of mood disorders. Sixty-six patients who met DSM-II1R criteria for mood disorders were grouped into those on OD Lithium (n=31) and those on DD lithium (n=35). The groups were matched on sociodemographic and clinical variables. The total daily dose was similar in the two groups, but the OD group tended to have higher serum lithium levels while the DD group tended to have a greater number of affective episodes during the period of follow up. The implications are discussed.
