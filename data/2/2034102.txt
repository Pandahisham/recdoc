Nerve growth factor and bromocriptine: a sequential therapy for human bromocriptine-resistant prolactinomas.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) administration to athymic mice with transplanted human bromocriptine-resistant prolactinoma, results in the expression of dopamine D-2 receptors in the tumour and restores sensitivity to subsequent treatment with bromocriptine, which then produces normalisation of plasma prolactin and tumour regression. Sequential administration of NGF and bromocriptine thus may be a promising therapy for patients refractory to bromocriptine.
