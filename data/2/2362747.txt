Colonoscopic polypectomy is a major advance in the therapy of colon neoplasms. The techniques for safe and efficient polyp removal are described. The uses of a variety of ancillarydevices are discussed, including clips, loops, submucosal injection of fluid, and several thermalprobes, including the argon plasma coagulator. The location of a lesion may be difficult toascertain by intracolonic landmarks, but can be more precisely determined by X-ray, magneticimaging, or intraoperative colonoscopy. Alternatively, it is possible to permanently mark thesite of polyp removal with a carbon particle submucosal injection to facilitate subsequentlocalization either by surgery or interval colonoscopy.
