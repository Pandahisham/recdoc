Although N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to be neuroprotective for traumatic brain injury (TBI), the mechanisms for this beneficial effect are still poorly understood. Cerebral inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of secondary brain injury after TBI. However, it has not been investigated whether NAC modulates TBI-induced cerebral inflammatory response. In this work, we investigated the effect of NAC administration on cortical expressions of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammatory proteins such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) after TBI. As a result, we found that NF-κB, proinflammatory cytokines, and ICAM-1 were increased in all injured animals. In animals given NAC post-TBI, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, and ICAM-1 were decreased in comparison to vehicle-treated animals. Measures of IL-6 showed no change after NAC treatment. NAC administration reduced brain edema, BBB permeability, and apoptotic index in the injured brain. The results suggest that post-TBI NAC administration may attenuate inflammatory response in the injured rat brain, and this may be one mechanism by which NAC ameliorates secondary brain damage following TBI.

Although traumatic  brain injury (TBI) represents a significant public healthproblem in the world, there are currently no treatments that improve clinicaloutcome measures [1, 2]. Recently, several reports from experimental studieshave demonstrated that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) played neuroprotective roles inTBI including restoration ofTBI-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, increasing the reduced antioxidantenzyme, and protecting neurons [3–5]. Most of these previous studies focused on the modulation of NAC onoxidative stress in the brain following TBI, but ignored the influence of NACon cerebral inflammation, which also played crucial roles in the mechanisms ofsecondary brain damage after TBI [6]. Furthermore, no study wasfound in the literature to investigate the effects of NAC administration on brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, andcortical apoptosis following TBI.
Several clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated thatsecondary brain injury can be magnified by numerous immune mediators, which arefrequently upregulated in response to TBI [7–9]. Increased levels of thesemolecules within the injured brain, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6(IL-6), and intercellular adhesionmolecule-1 (ICAM-1), are believed to contribute to the cerebral damage, celldeath, and BBB dysfunction [10]. A pivotal player in the regulation of thesemolecules is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) family (cRel, RelA/p65, RelB,p50 and p52) of transcription factors [11, 12]. In our previous studies, wehave demonstrated that cortical contusion trauma could induce a concomitant andpersistent upregulation of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, and ICAM-1 in the injured rat brain, which might play a centralrole in the injury-induced inflammatory response of brain [13, 14].
NAC is a compound that increases the pool of glutathione. The latter is an importantcellular antioxidant. It is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger and canrestore the reduced cellular glutathione [15]. It is also cytoprotective sinceit inhibits the activation of NF-κB and TNF-α production by lipopolysaccharide [16, 17]. Xiong et al.have reported that NAC could greatly restore brain glutathione levels andmitochondrial glutathione levels after TBI [3]. Also, in a rat model ofexperimental stroke, administration of NAC after ischemia onset protected thebrain from free radical injury, apoptosis, and inflammation, with a widetreatment window [18]. Nevertheless, it is still unknown up till now whether NAC can affect the production of inflammatoryagents in the brain after TBI.
The aim of the current study was to determine whether NAC could attenuatethe TBI-induced brain inflammation in the pericontusional area. We hypothesized that the effect of NAC on modulating cerebral inflammatory response might be a mechanism by which NAC reduced cerebral edema, protected BBB, and repressed cortical apoptosis after TBI.
Male Wistar rats (250–300 g) werepurchased from Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The rats were housed in temperature and humidity controlled animal quarterswith a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All procedures were approved by theInstitutional Animal Care Committee and were in accordance with the guidelinesof the National Institutes of Health on the care and use of animals.
Rat model of cortical contusion trauma: followingIP anesthesia with urethane (1000 mg/kg), animal head was fixed in thestereotactic frame. A right parietal craniotomy (diameter 5 mm) was drilled under aseptic conditions 1 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral to the bregma. We used a modification of Feeney'sweight-drop model in which a freefalling weight onto the exposed intact cranial dura produced a standardizedparietal contusion by letting a steel rod weighing 40 g with a flat end diameter of 4 mm fall onto a piston resting on the dura from a height of 25 cm [19].The piston was allowed to compress the tissue a maximum of 5 mm. After operation procedures, the rats were then returned totheir cages and the room temperature kept at 23 ± 1°C. Heart rate, arterial bloodpressure, and rectal temperature were monitored, and the rectal temperature waskept at 37 ± 0.5°C, by using physical cooling (ice bag) when required, throughoutexperiments. Sham-operated rats were anesthetized and mounted in the stereotacticapparatus, with right parietal craniotomy surgically prepared alone and withoutbrain injury.
We established 3 experimental groups in a randomized fashion: (a) the shamoperation group (SHAM; n = 15), (b) the TBI group (TBI; n = 18), and (c) the NACtreatment group (TBI-NAC; n = 18). Rats of TBI-NAC group received injections of150 mg/kg NAC IP at 15 minutes and 1, 2, and 3 days after the surgery. Rats ofSHAM and TBI groups received equal volumes of 0.9% saline solution. The dosewas chosen according to Hicdonmez et al. since they observed beneficial effectson preventing trauma-induced oxidative brain tissue damage following TBI aftertreatment with NAC using the same protocol [4]. The animals were decapitated 3days after injury for tissue assays. The surrounding brain tissue of theinjured cortex (see Figure 1) was dissected on ice as described in our previousstudy [14], some of which wereput into 10% buffered formalin, the others were stored at liquidnitrogen immediately until use.
Nuclear protein was extracted andquantified as described [14, 20]. EMSA was performed using a commercial kit (Gel ShiftAssay System; Promega, Madison, Wis, USA) following the methods in our laboratory. The NF-κB oligonucleotide probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′)was end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP (Free Biotech, Beijing, China). EMSAwas performed according to our previous study [14, 20].
The levels of inflammatory mediatorswere quantified using specific ELISA kits for rats according to themanufacturers' instructions (TNF-α from Diaclone Research, Besançon, France; IL-1β, IL-6 from Biosource Europe SA, Nivelles, Belgium)and our previous studies [14, 20]. Values were expressed as ng/g protein.
Immunohistochemical studies were conducted on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. The rabbit-antiratmonoclonal antibody of ICAM-1 (diluted 1 : 100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,Calif, USA) was used. Immunohistochemical assay was performedaccording to our previous study [14]. The positive cells were identified, counted, and analyzedunder the light microscope by an investigator blinded to the grouping. The number ofpositive microvessels in each section was counted in 10 microscopic fields (at× 100 magnifications) and averaged for the positively immunostained vesselnumber of per visual field.
Brain edema was determined using the wet/dry method aspreviously described where thepercentage of brain water = [(wet weight − dry weight)/wet weight] × 100% [21]. Briefly, brains were rapidly removed from the skull and thebilateral brains were separated. Both were placed separately into preweighedand labeled glass vials and weighed. The vials were then placed in an oven for72 hours at 100°C and then reweighed to obtain dry weight content. The numberof animals used in each group for brain edema study was as follows: for SHAM (n = 5), for TBI (n = 6), and forTBI-NAC (n = 6).
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was determined byEvans blue (EB) extravasation at 3 days after TBI. Briefly, 2% Evans blue wasinjected IV at a dose of 2 mL/kg. Animals were then reanesthetized after 1 hourwith urethane (1000 mg/kg) and perfused using saline to remove intravascular EB dye. Animals were thendecapitated; the brains were removed and homogenized in phosphate bufferedsaline. Trichloroacetic acid was then added to precipitate protein, and thesamples were cooled and centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was measured forabsorbance of EB at 610 nm using a spectrophotometer. The number of animalsused in each group for BBB permeability study was as follows: for SHAM (n = 5), for TBI (n = 6), and for TBI-NAC(n = 6).
The formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin andsectioned at 4 μm thickness with a microtome. The sections were detected forapoptotic cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick endlabeling (TUNEL) method. TUNEL: in situ cell death detection kit POD (ISCDD, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany)was used. The procedures were according to the protocol of the kit and our previous study[14]. The positive cellswere identified, counted, and analyzed under the light microscope by aninvestigator blinded to the grouping. The extent of brain damage was evaluatedby apoptotic index which was the average number of TUNEL-positive cells ineach section counted in 10 microscopic fields (at ×200 magnifications).
All data were presented as mean ± SD. SPSS 12.0 was used forstatistical analysis of the data. All data were subjected to one-way ANOVA. Differences between experimental groups were determined by Fisher's LSDposttest. Statistical  significance was inferred at P < .05.
EMSA autoradiography of NF-κB DNA binding activity of the injured brain samples wasshown in Figure 2. Low NF-κB binding activity (weak EMSA autoradiography) was found in the SHAMgroup. Compared with SHAM group, NF-κB binding activity in the injured brain was significantly increased (P < .01) in TBI group. In TBI-NAC group, the NF-κB binding activity was significantly downregulated (P < .01) in the brain area surrounding the injury site after TBI.
Concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were low in the ratbrains of SHAM group (6.16 ± 1.63, 0.58 ± 0.20, and 0.19 ± 0.03 ng/g protein, resp.) (see Figure 3). Compared with SHAM group, cortical levels of the threeinflammatory cytokines were greatly induced after TBI (P < .01). As shown in Figure 3, NAC administration after TBIcould lead to significantly decreased IL-1β and TNF-α concentrations, but hadno significant effect on the IL-6 concentration (P > .05) in rat brain tissue.
As shown in Figure 4(a), few ICAM-1-immunostained cerebralmicrovessels were observed in the SHAM group rat brain. In TBI group, thenumber of ICAM-1-positive vessels was significantly increased as compared withthat in the SHAM group (P < .01) (seeFigures 4(b) and 4(d)). In TBI-NAC group, when compared with the TBI group, thenumber of ICAM-1-positive vessels was significantly decreased (P < .05) (see Figures 4(c) and 4(d)).The results showed that systemic injections of NAC could significantlydownregulate the ICAM-1 immunoreactivity in the vessels of injured brain (see Figure4(d)).
Significant increase (P < .01) in water content was detected in the brain samples of injured side at3 days after TBI when compared with sham-operated rats (see Figure 5). The meanvalue of brain water content in the injured side was decreased by NACadministration (P < .01) ascompared with TBI group. For the uninjured side, the mean values of brain water content had no significant difference among SHAM, TBI, and TBI-NAC groups. Theresults suggested that post-TBI NAC treatment could attenuate brain edema in this rat TBI model.
The pattern of Evans blue extravasation following TBI isshown in Figure 6. Rats in TBI group demonstrated a significant increase (P < .01) in BBB permeability to Evansblue relative to rats of SHAM group. Administration of NAC significantlyinhibited Evans blue extravasation (P < .05), indicating a reduced BBB opening in response to NAC treatment.
Few TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were found in the SHAM group rat brain (see Figure 7(a)). In TBI group, the apoptotic index in the cortex surrounding the injuredsite was found to be significantly increased compared with that in SHAM animals (P < .01) (see Figures 7(b) and 7(d)).In TBI-NAC group, when compared with that in the TBI group, the apoptotic index in the studied cortex wassignificantly decreased (P < .01)(see Figures 7(c) and 7(d)). The result showed that NAC administration following TBI could lead less cell death in the brain surrounding the corticalcontusion and was potential to ameliorate the secondary brain damage followingTBI.
The main findings of this study are that (1) as common inflammation-related factorsto TBI, NF-κB, proinflammatory cytokines, and ICAM-1were upregulated afterTBI and could be suppressed when treated with NAC and (2) after NACadministration, the brain edema, BBB permeability, and apoptotic cell death were ameliorated. These findings suggest for the first time that NAC attenuates the TBI-induced cerebralinflammatory response and alleviates secondary brain damage following primary trauma in the rat TBI model.
There have been several studies focusing on the neuroprotective effects of NAC in TBI. Asmentioned by Ellis et al. in their literature, NAC could direct scavengeradicals and stimulate glutathione peroxidase activity in a cat TBI model [22].Their results suggested that NAC might be useful for treatment of oxygen-freeradical-mediated brain injury. Another research indicated that NAC administeredpostinjury at an early stage could effectively restore TBI-inducedmitochondrial dysfunction and the protective effect of NAC might be related toits restoration of glutathione levels in the brain [3]. More recent data revealed byHicdonmez et al. was thatNAC treatment after trauma was effective in lipid peroxidation, antioxidantenzyme activity, and neuronal protection in cerebral injury following closedhead trauma [4]. In this current study, we found that NAC administrationfollowing TBI could reduce cerebral edema, BBB permeability, and apoptotic cell death which playedimportant roles and were the major part in the secondary brain injury followingTBI. However, despite the demonstrated mechanisms of NAC in neuroprotection, none of the previous studies focused on cerebral inflammatory response that might facilitate the development ofsecondary brain damage following primary trauma.
Brain inflammation represents only one of the numerous processes activated after TBI;it has not been fully elucidated due to the complexity of the large number ofmolecules shaping a sophisticated circuitry. The major effectors in thiscascade are the proinflammatory cytokines that are usually released withinminutes after challenge because they are stored intracellularly as precursorproteins eventually modified into active molecules. TBI damages the blood-brainbarrier, then the blood cells such as neutrophils and macrophages accumulate inthe brain and further sustain the cerebral inflammatory cascade [23]. Numerous immunemediators such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 released within minutes of the primary injury can initiatethe infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain by activating ICAM-1 andother adhesion molecules [14]. The functionalimportance of NF-κB in acute inflammation is based on its ability to regulate the promoters of avariety of genes whose products, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, and acutephase proteins, are critical to inflammatory processes [11]. NF-κB activation enhances thetranscription of proinflammatory cytokines, and the cytokines are known to inturn activate NF-κB [24]. The positive  feedback is believed to serve to amplify inflammatorysignals. In our previous studies, it has been found that there were an  early concomitant and persistent upregulationof NF-κB binding activity, TNF-α, IL-6, and ICAM-1 expression in the injured brainafter cortical contusion trauma [13, 14].
A number of studies have demonstrated that NAC could modulate inflammatory factorsproduction such as NF-κB, proinflammatory cytokines, and ICAM-1 [25]. Carrollet al. examined the influence of NAC on cerebral NF-κB activity after temporarymiddle cerebral artery occlusion and indicated that activated NF-κB wassignificantly increased 15 minutes after reperfusion in the affected hemisphereand could be abolished with NAC treatment [25]. Li et al. investigated effectsof NAC on NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokines production in proteinmalnutrition using an animal septic shock model and their results suggestedthat supplementation of NAC could normalize lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κBactivation and proinflammatory cytokines production during early rehabilitationof protein malnourished mice [26]. Our study showed that cortical levels ofNF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and ICAM-1 were significantly induced by TBI at 3 daysafter trauma. Post-TBI NAC administration could repress the expressions of mostof these inflammatory agents that accompanied TBI. Although our data have provedthat NAC could downregulate the cerebral inflammatory factors after TBI,changes about the signaling pathways of inflammation and oxidative stress in the brainremain unknown. It is assured that further ingenious studies are needed and will be conducted in our laboratory.
Apoptosis in the traumatically injured brain occurs not only at the impact site but also as aresult of secondary brain insults such as intracranial hypertension, hypoxia,or disturbances of microcirculation [27]. Studies regarding the effect of NAC on neural apoptosis afterTBI have not been found to date. Nevertheless, several previous studies have demonstrated that NACcould prevent apoptotic death of neuronal cells in vitro [28, 29]. NAC alsoinhibited procaspase-9 processing and the activation of enzymatic activity of caspases induced byacrolein. Inhibition of acrolein-induced apoptosis using NAC was confirmedmorphologically by diminished condensation of nuclear chromatin, as evaluatedby fluorescence microscopy [30]. In this present study, we found that systemic NACadministration could inhibit apoptotic cell death in the injured brain and waspotential to reduce the secondary brain damage following TBI. However, it isstill unclear whether NAC can modulate the apoptotic signals and the whole mechanismsinvolved call for further research.
In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study todemonstrate the effect of NAC on the inflammatory response in the injured brain after TBI. We foundthat TBI could upregulate the expressions of NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, and ICAM-1 in the surrounding brain of injured site, which could be markedly inhibited by NAC administration. The therapeutic benefit of post-TBI NAC administration might be due to its salutary effect on modulating cerebralinflammation secondary to TBI.
