Prognosis of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and discoidlesions*

 It has been observed that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and discoidlesions have a milder systemic disease. 
 To compare the clinical, demographic and autoantibody profile of systemic lupuserythematosus patients with and without discoid lesions. 
We carried out a retrospective study involving 288 systemic lupus erythematosuspatients who met at least four classification criteria of the American College ofRheumatology for systemic lupus erythematosus, comparing the clinical, serologicaland demographic factors between patients with and without discoid manifestations.
 Of the 288 patients, 13.8% had discoid lesions. Univariate analysis found nodifferences in the prevalence of malar rash, photosensitivity, arthritis,serositis, leukopenia, lymphopenia and hemolytic anemia or anemia of the centralnervous system (p = ns). Renal lesions were more common in those without discoidlesions (p =0.016), and hemolysis (p<0.0001) was more common in those withdiscoid lesions. Regarding the profile of autoantibodies, only the anti-RNPantibody was more common in those with discoid events (p =0.04). In a logisticregression study, only the renal lesions and anti-RNP maintained theirassociations with discoid manifestations.

Estudo retrospectivo de 288 pacientes com lúpus eritematososistêmico que satisfizeram pelo menos 4 critériosclassificatórios do Colégio Americano de Reumatologia para odiagnóstico de lúpus eritematoso sistêmico, comparando-se osachados clínicos, sorológicos e demográficos entre pacientescom e sem manifestações discoides. 
Dos 288 pacientes, 13,8% tinham lesões discoides. Na análiseunivariada não se encontraram diferenças quanto àprevalência de eritema malar, fotossensibilidade, artrite, serosite,leucopenia, linfopenia e anemia hemolítica ou de sistema nervoso central(p=ns). Lesões renais foram mais comuns naqueles sem lesão discoide(p =0,016), e a hemólise (p<0.0001) foi mais comum nos comlesão discoide. No que se refere ao perfil de autoanticorpos apenas oanticorpo anti-RNP foi mais comum naqueles com manifestaçõesdiscoides (p=0,04). Em estudo por regressão logística, só aslesões renais e o anticorpo anti-RNP mantiveram suasassociações com manifestações discoides. 
Pacientes de lúpus eritematoso sistêmico com lesões discoidestêm menor prevalência de envolvimento renal e uma maiorpresença do anticorpo anti RNP.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease that has a wide variety of clinicalforms. They may range from a mild disease limited to the skin and joints to more seriousforms involving the kidneys and central nervous system, which may compromise thesurvival of the patient.1
Some patients with SLE may form distinct clinical groups, some related to the profile ofthe produced autoantibodies. In these groups, the appearance of a particular symptom maylead to the expected appearance of another.2,3,4 An example of these associations is that of anti-dsDNA, LAC (lupusanticoagulant) and aCl (anticardiolipin), which are more represented in Caucasians andlinked to arterial and venous thrombosis, strokes and livedoreticularis.4 Knowledge ofthese associations is important for the physician who accompanies the patient becausethey allow a careful follow-up and they help to determine the individual prognosis.
According to some authors, SLE patients who have discoid lesions usually have a milderdisease, with fewer renal manifestations and antibodies to dsDNA.5 These authors consider discoid lesions asmarkers for a more benign course of the disease. As systemic lupus disease is influencedby genetic background, it is interesting to know whether it applies to the Brazilianpopulation, which is quite different from other populations due to its high degree ofracial miscegenation.1 It is in thiscontext that the present study was undertaken.
This retrospective study was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee. Itanalyzed the medical records of 288 patients of both sexes who met at least 4 of theclassification criteria for SLE established by the American College of Rheumatology(ACR).6
The studied group formed a convenience nonprobability sample and it was part of the 416lupus patients followed over the past 5 years (January 2006 to December 2011) at asingle outpatient university center whose medical records had been properly filled,allowing a correct analysis.
We collected demographic, clinical profiles (according to the classification criteriadefined by the ACR) and autoantibody profiles.6 Patients with and without discoid lesions were compared using theFisher's exact test and chi-square test for nominal data and Mann-Whitney test fornumeric data. The level of significance was 5%, and the calculations were made with theaid of the GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0. To analyze the correlation of discoidlesions with variables whose p> 0.05, we carried out a multivariate analysis(logistic regression) using Medcalc, version 12 .1.3.0.
The analysis of the study population showed that of the 288 patients, 21 (7.3%) were menand 267 (92.7%) were women aged between 17 and 70 years, a median of 38.00 (28-46)years; the age at diagnosis was between 17 and 69 years, a median of 30.00 (22-38.7)years, and disease duration was between 6 and 483 months, a median of 72 (36-132)months.
In this population, we found the following: 40/288 (13.8%) with discoid lesions, 215/284(75.7%) with photosensitivity; 150/282 (53.1%) with malar rash, 128/282 (45.3% ) withoral ulcers, 19/287 (6.6%) with psychosis, 28/285 (9.8%) with seizures, 61/288 (21.2%)with serositis, 165/280 (58.9%) with arthritis, 80/284 with leukopenia, 69/283 (24.3%)with thrombocytopenia, 43/270 (15.9%) with lymphopenia, 27/284 (9.5%) with hemolyticanemia. All patients with glomerulonephritis (diagnosed according to the ACRcriteria(6) as having more than0.5g of protein in a 24-hour urine collection or an active urinary sediment - 133/280 or47.5%) underwent renal biopsy and were classified as class 6 (10/280), class 5 (31/208),class 4 (55/280), class 3 (28/280) and class 2 (9/280).
The profile of autoantibodies showed the following: 100% positive ANA, anti-dsDNA in95/284 (33.5%), anti-Ro in 103/281 (36.6%), anti-La in 53/279 (19, 0%), anti-Sm in66/276 (23.91%), anti-RNP in 71/250 (28.4%), aCl IgG in 40/280 (14.2%), 37 IgM in aCl /282 (13.1%) and LAC in 27/256 (19.5%).
The comparison between patients with and without discoid lesions can be seen in table 1.
Clinical and autoantibody profile in systemic lupus erythematosus patients withand without discoid lesions. (N= 288)
In a logistic regression analysis in which the discoid lesions were considered asdependent variables and kidney damage, hemolytic anemia and presence of anti-RNP asindependent variables, it was observed that only kidney damage (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.65 to0.98) and anti-RNP (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.19) maintained its associations.
Cutaneous lesions can provide the physician with much information about SLE patients.They are present in 25% of cases at the beginning of the disease and are easilyaccessible to clinical examination.7,8 Specific lesions (such as discoid form,subacute lupus and lupus acute) suggest the diagnosis of the disease, whereasnonspecific lesions inform us about the same activity.8
Discoid lesions may be part of the spectrum of lupus erythematosus or may appearisolated as a disease confined to the skin. It is estimated that the systemic form ofthe disease appear in 17-30% of those who initially present only discoid lesions, andthere are discoid lesions in 8-28% of those with an established diagnosis of systemiclupus erythematosus.8,9,10 The generalizedform of discoid lesions, i.e., the one that affects areas of the skin below the neck, isassociated with an increased tendency to become systemic (20% of cases), whereas thereis a 5% risk that those lesions limited to the head will develop into the systemicform.11,12
In the present study, we found that patients with discoid lesions have a lower risk ofkidney disease (OR = 0.8) and a higher prevalence of anti-RNP (OR = 2.4). These findingscorroborate previous observations made in a series of patients. Callen etal. described 17 patients with SLE and discoid lesions of whom only one hadlupus nephritis.13 In another studyinvolving 65 patients with discoid lesions, some with extra cutaneous manifestations,only one had proteinuria.14 Merolaet al. described 16 patients with SLE and discoid lesions of whomfour had antidsDNA antibodies and two had a history of nephritis.5 In the series currently described, noassociation with anti-dsDNA was found. While this may seem paradoxical, since thisautoantibody has been associated with nephritis, there is the observation that perhapsthis association is not so strong in our population.15 A study in Bahia showed that anti-dsDNA is not associated withlupus nephritis in African-Brazilians with SLE. 16
Interestingly, we observed a positive association between the occurrence of discoidlesions and anti-RNP. This antibody has been linked with mixed connective tissuedisease, which has classically shown a low prevalence of renal involvement.17
Summarizing, we can say that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and discoidlesions have a lower prevalence of renal involvement. Since this is a severemanifestation of SLE, discoid lesions may point to patients with better prognosis.
