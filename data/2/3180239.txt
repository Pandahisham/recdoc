Clinical approach in treatment of resistant                    hypertension

Resistant hypertension, defined as failure to achieve target blood pressure                    despite the use of optimal or maximum doses of at least 3 agents, one of which                    is a diuretic, or requiring 4 or more medications to achieve blood pressure                    goal, is likely to affect up to 20% of all patients with hypertension.                    Apparent resistant hypertension may be caused by medication nonadherence,                    substances that either interfere with antihypertensive mediations or cause blood                    pressure elevation, and under- or inappropriate medication treatment. Certain                    patient characteristics are associated with the presence of resistant                    hypertension and include chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, and presence                    of end-organ damage (microalbuminuria, retinopathy, left-ventricular                    hypertrophy). Secondary causes of resistant hypertension are not uncommon and                    include obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease, primary aldosteronism,                    renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, and Cushing’s disease. Initial                    medication management usually includes adding or increasing the dose of a                    diuretic, which is effective in lowering the blood pressure of a large number of                    patients with resistant hypertension. Additional management options include                    maximizing lifestyle modification, combination therapy of antihypertensive                    agents depending on individual patient characteristics, adding less-commonly                    used fourth- or fifth-line antihypertensive agents, and referral to a                    hypertension specialist.

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure that is above the                patient’s goal despite the use of 3 or more antihypertensive agents from                different classes (one of which should ideally be a diuretic) at optimal doses.1 This definition includes people who                require 4 or more medications to achieve blood pressure control. Resistant                hypertension is distinguished from uncontrolled hypertension. Uncontrolled                hypertension includes both patients with inadequately treated hypertension and those                with true resistant hypertension.1,2 It is usually more                difficult to attain systolic blood pressure goals than diastolic blood pressure                    goals.1
Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for end-organ damage such as                left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerotic plaques, retinopathy, and                microalbuminuria than similar patients who have controlled hypertension3,4 making both identification of and treatment of                patients with RH important in prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.                Additionally, patients with true resistant hypertension are at increased risk for                cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with hypertensive patients with                controlled hypertension or pseudoresistance.5
The exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is unknown1 but has been estimated to be 10% to                    20%.6–8 Patient characteristics associated                with resistant hypertension include older age, higher baseline systolic blood                pressure, obesity, excessive salt consumption, chronic kidney disease, diabetes,                left ventricular hypertrophy, black race, female gender, and living in the                southeastern United States.1,8 Certain genetic phenotypes may also                promote the development of resistant hypertension, although this area of study is                relatively limited.1
Pseudoresistance is uncontrolled hypertension caused by under treatment or treatment                with inappropriate agents, incorrect blood pressure measurement, white coat                hypertension, or medication nonadherence.9 Differentiating true resistant hypertension from pseudoresistance is a                key component of patient evaluation.1,3,10 This includes: identification of                substances that may contribute to or cause elevated blood pressure, identification                of secondary causes, evaluation of medication adherence, and establishing correct                blood pressure measurement. Two common causes of incorrect blood pressure                measurement are not allowing the patient to sit quietly before obtaining the                measurement and using a cuff that is too small.1
Since up to 30% of patients with apparent resistant hypertension may evidence                blood pressure control on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), using                24-hour ABPM is indicated in establishing the diagnosis of true resistant                    hypertension.9,11,12 White coat hypertension may mimic resistant                hypertension, and one study found a 20% to 30% prevalence of                controlled blood pressure as measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure                monitoring among patients with resistant hypertension.11 White coat hypertension or pseudoresistance                should be considered in patients with apparent resistant hypertension who do not                have evidence of end-organ damage or who have symptoms of hypotension.13,14 In elderly patients, arterial stiffness may cause                pseudoresistance because less compressible stiff arteries cause falsely elevated                blood pressure readings.15
In distinguishing patients with true resistant hypertension from patients with white                coat hypertension, certain patient characteristics show a higher likelihood of being                associated with true resistant hypertension. These characteristics include: male                gender, systolic blood pressure in the office of ≥180 mmHg, elevated fasting                blood sugar, low serum potassium, and evidence of end-organ disease                (microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy).16
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of resistant hypertension and higher                blood pressure readings in general.1 While the reasons for the increased risk of resistant hypertension in                obese patients is not known with certainty, factors hypothesized to play a role                include sympathetic activation in the kidney, increased activation of the                renin-angiotensin system, increased intrarenal pressures from surrounding adipose                tissue, and changes to the renal architecture including glomerular injury.17
Diabetes and hypertension are closely associated, although the role of insulin                resistance in causing hypertension is not defined.1 Patients with both diabetes and hypertension are                more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension and typically require 2 or more                antihypertensive agents to reach blood pressure goals.1,2
Ingestion of salt in the diet is associated with both essential hypertension and                resistant hypertension. Older patients, African-American patients, and patients with                chronic kidney disease may be particularly susceptible to the blood pressure effects                of salt intake.1
Excessive alcohol consumption as well as use of illicit drugs can be associated with                resistant hypertension.1 Cigarette                smoking can elevate blood pressure for up to 30 minutes and should be considered a                potential cause of an elevated blood pressure reading.18
Medications, both over-the-counter and prescription, can cause elevated blood                pressure and may play a role in resistant hypertension (see Table 1). Common medications that can cause elevated                blood pressure include: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, aspirin, COX-2                inhibitors, decongestants, stimulant medications used for weight loss, narcolepsy or                attention deficit disorder, oral contraceptive pills, cyclosporine, and                    erythropoieitin.1 Herbal                supplements that act as stimulants such as ma huang or ephedra also can cause                elevated blood pressure.
Secondary causes of resistant hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea, chronic                kidney disease, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma,                Cushing’s disease, coarctation of the aorta, hyper- or hypothyroidism, and                intracranial tumor1,3 and are present in approximately                10% to 20% of patients with resistant hypertension who are adherent                with prescribed treatment.19
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is independently associated with resistant hypertension                with a reported odds ratio of 5.0 in one case control study20 and has been reported to be present in the                majority of patients with resistant hypertension presenting to a hypertension                    clinic.21 Increased severity                of OSA is associated with increased risk for resistant hypertension.1,2
In a group of patients with resistant hypertension, those with a higher probability                of having OSA had a significantly higher prevalence of primary aldosteronism (PA)                compared to those with a lower probability of OSA based on a validated questionnaire                (36 vs 19%).22 A study of                consecutive patients with resistant hypertension found a relationship between                severity of obstructive sleep apnea and aldosterone excess.21 This may indicate that obstructive sleep apnea                stimulates aldosterone excretion leading to an increased risk of PA and therefore RH                in patients affected by OSA. Alternatively, another factor such as obesity may                increase risk for both OSA and excess aldosterone excretion.22 Hypoxia experienced by patients with OSA likely                leads to sympathetic nervous system activation which in turn raises blood                    pressure.1
Treatment of OSA with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device has been                shown to reduce blood pressure levels, with the greatest benefit seen in those with                severe OSA who were already receiving antihypertensive treatment.1
Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with resistant hypertension                    have primary aldosteronism (PA).1,23 The                    prevalence of PA tends to increase with increasingly severe hypertension.24 PA may be associated with                    both obesity and OSA.1
Aldosterone has been demonstrated to exert a number of influences leading to                    increased systemic vascular resistance including an association with endothelial                    dysfunction, vascular remodeling through collagen deposition, vascular damage,                    impairment of the baroreflex leading to loss of compensation for elevated blood                    pressure, and hypervolemia.2,24,25 Aldosterone may promote both                    renal and cardiovascular injury by mechanisms other than blood pressure                        elevation.24 Aldosterone                    excess, in the absence of diagnosed primary aldosteronism, may contribute to                    resistant hypertension as evidenced by the benefit of aldosterone antagonists in                    patients both with and without PA as well as the demonstration of biochemical                    markers of aldosterone excess in patients with RH.8 Primary aldosteronism may represent the                    end-point of a continuum that starts with a low-renin, normotensive state and                    progresses through low-renin hypertension to normokalemic primary aldosteronism                    and finally hypokalemic primary aldosteronism.26,27
Primary aldosteronism may be suggested by hypokalemia,7 although this may be a late finding of the                    disease process, occurring after hypertension has already developed.1 PA is equally prevalent among                    both black and white patients with RH.7
Since primary aldosteronism is often effectively treated with an aldosterone                    antagonist, it remains controversial whether establishing the diagnosis is                    necessary in those patients who screen positive with an elevated                    aldosteronerenin ratio.28,29 While                    adrenal adenectomy is indicated when an aldosterone-producing adenoma is found                    and can be curative of primary aldosteronism and hypertension, most patients                    found to have primary aldosteronism do not have an identified adenoma and can be                    medically managed.28
Multiple factors likely cause hypertension in patients with chronic kidney                    disease. These include intravascular volume expansion and activation of the                    renin-angiotensin system.30                    Other factors hypothesized to play a causative role include activation of the                    sympathetic nervous system by decreased blood flow to the kidneys or hypoxemia                    during sleep apnea events, alterations in endothelium derived vasoconstrictors                    and vasodilators, increased arterial stiffness, reactive oxygen species                    (possibly secondary to vasoconstriction), renal ischemia, or recombinant human                        erythropoietin.30                    Uncontrolled hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease is common with                    an elevated serum creatinine being a strong predictor of resistant                        hypertension.1
While renal artery atherosclerotic disease is relatively common in hypertensive                    patients, what role obstructive lesions play in the elevated blood pressure of                    these patients is not known.1                    In patients with resistant hypertension, renal artery atherosclerotic disease is                    a common secondary cause of hypertension, with a higher prevalence among older                    patients, smokers, patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, and patients                    with unexplained renal insufficiency.1 Treatment of renal artery stenosis from atherosclerotic disease                    with surgical or endovascular revascularization has not been reliably shown to                    improve blood pressure control.1 In contrast, angioplasty of fibromuscular disease causing renal                    artery stenosis (RAS) can be curative and is almost always beneficial.1 Renal artery disease is most                    commonly related to atherosclerotic plaques, fewer than 10% of lesions                    being fibromuscular.1
While rare, pheochromocytoma may be found in a small minority of patients with                    RH. Elevated blood pressure occurs in 95% of patients with                    pheochromocytoma, although only about half of patients have persistently                    elevated blood pressure.1                    Pheochromocytoma should be considered in a patient with resistant hypertension                    who experiences headaches, palpitations, and sweating.1
Elevated blood pressure is common in patients with Cushing’s syndrome                    with a prevalence of resistant hypertension that may be similar to the general                    population of patients with hypertension (about 1 in 5).1 The pathophysiologic mechanism of blood                    pressure elevation in Cushing’s syndrome can result in most                    antihypertensive agents being ineffective in lowering blood pressure.1 Mineralocorticoid receptor                    antagonists are particularly effective antihypertensive agents in patients with                    Cushing’s syndrome since blood pressure elevation results from                    cortisol-mediated activation of the mineralocorticoid receptors.1 However, other factors can play                    a role in blood pressure elevation including OSA and insulin resistance.1
Resistant hypertension is not uncommonly linked to other medical conditions, and                    patient evaluation should focus on historical features which may suggest related                    conditions (see Table 2).                    Obstructive sleep apnea should be considered in any patient with daytime                    somnolence, snoring, and witnessed apnea. RAS should be considered in patients                    with signs or symptoms of peripheral or coronary artery disease.                    Pheochromocytoma should be considered when labile hypertension is accompanied by                    palpitations and diaphoresis.
Nonadherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications is common with reported                    prevalence at 40% to 60%.1,18 Medication nonadherence is more common in chronic, asymptomatic                    diseases and for treatment that lasts longer than 6 months, making non-adherence                    in the treatment of hypertension a particular problem.12 Therefore, patients should be assessed for                    medication adherence at each visit and particularly with apparent resistant                    hypertension. Clinicians should be aware of factors which may increase the risk                    of patient nonadherence such as medication side effects, cost, and dosing                    inconvenience of prescribed medications1 as well as poor patient understanding of medication purpose and                    use or the presence of organic brain dysfunction impairing the patient’s                    ability to take medications as prescribed.18 Additional information solicited from                    patients may include whether the patient understands which medications are                    prescribed for hypertension, how medications are organized, stored, and                    administered at home, and whether medications are being transferred from old                    prescription bottles or shared with other family members. Family members are                    another potential source of information and may be particularly good resources                    when assessing medication adherence in older or disabled patients who may be                    more dependent on family assistance in securing and administering                        medications.1 Clinicians                    can promote medication adherence through patient education, selecting once-daily                    dosing regimens when possible, avoiding drug interactions, and providing                    reminders and positive feedback on improved blood pressure values.19
Assessing adherence can be challenging but is a necessary component in the                    evaluation of a patient with apparent resistant hypertension. Use of an                    electronic monitoring system improves detection of patient’s                    non-adherence with prescribed medications and is superior to pill counting or                    physician estimates of adherence.31 Several issues regarding adherence to prescription medication                    regimens should be considered. The first is that adherence is a dynamic process                    – varying over time and improving right before a scheduled office                        visit.31 Additionally, the                    type of antihypertensive medication plays a role with angiotensin receptor                    blockers (ARBs) being associated with the highest likelihood of continued                        adherence.31 Finally,                    electronic monitoring of adherence, beyond improved identification of poor                    adherence, has been demonstrated to improve blood pressure control.31 If questions remain about                    medication adherence, consideration should be given to a short term                    hospitalization for closer observation.19
Establishing the diagnosis of resistant hypertension starts by properly                    evaluating blood pressure measurement and excluding white coat                        hypertension.1 Clinic blood                    pressure measurement can be falsely elevated due to a number of factors                    including room temperature, recent patient exercise, nicotine, alcohol or other                    recent substance use by the patient, incorrect arm position of the patient,                    talking by the clinician or patient and inability of the clinician to hear the                    Korotkoff sounds.32 Clinic                    measurement of blood pressure should occur after the patient has been sitting                    for at least 5 minutes. The patient should be seated with both back and arm                    supported and legs uncrossed. The blood pressure cuff should not be placed over                    any clothing and clothing should be removed to avoid a constricting effect on                    the upper arm.32 The                    patient’s arm should be at heart level with a cuff that encircles at                    least 80% of the arm circumference.32 Clinicians can demonstrate two types of digit                    bias – both for a terminal zero (ie, 120 instead of 122) and for a                    reading indicating that goal has been achieved.32 It is recommended that 2 measurements be                    taken at least 1 minute apart and averaged to obtain the blood pressure                        reading.32
The physical examination of a patient with suspected resistant hypertension                    should focus on identification of both micro- and macrovascular                        complications.1 The                    presence of end-organ damage supports a history of uncontrolled                        hypertension.1 Evaluation                    for end-organ damage includes a fundoscopic examination looking for retinopathy                    and a cardiovascular examination looking for bruits and displacement of the PMI                    indicating left-ventricular hypertrophy.1 Additional historical and physical exam                    findings that may indicate secondary causes of hypertension should be sought                    (see Table 2).
Laboratory evaluation of a patient with known or suspected resistant hypertension                    includes a hematocrit, basic metabolic panel, a urinalysis including testing for                    microalbumin, lipids, glucose, uric acid, thyroid stimulating hormone (as                    thyroid disease is associated with hypertension), and a screen for primary                    aldosteronism (see below).1,3,12 Serum creatinine should not                    be relied upon to identify chronic kidney disease and a glomerular filtration                    rate using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation should be                    calculated in patients with resistant hypertension.12,29 If pheochromocytoma is suspected, a urine or plasma test for                    fractionated free metanephrines (ie, metanephrine and normetanephrine) is                    indicated. The plasma test has a reported 99% to 100%                    sensitivity and an 89% to 97.6% specificity.1,33 Testing for microalbuminuria is important for                    identification of end-organ damage that provides prognostic information on                    cardiovascular risk but also because it may affect choice of antihypertensive                        medications.18
Screening for primary aldosteronism can be done with plasma renin and serum                    aldosterone ratio measurement (which has a high sensitivity but low specificity)                    and confirmed with sodium loading or fludrocortisone suppression testing.12,23 While measurement of serum aldosterone                    – plasma renin ratio has a high negative predictive value, it may be                    falsely positive up to 50% of the time.23 Confirmatory testing of primary aldosteronism                    can be done with infusion of 2 L of normal saline over 4 hours followed by                    measurement of plasma aldosterone. Failure of the saline infusion to suppress                    aldosterone to less than 5 to 10 ng/dL indicates primary aldosteronism.28 Alternatively, 24-hour urine                    excretion of aldosterone can be measured as an outpatient during dietary sodium                        loading.28 Hypokalemia is                    not a reliable indicator of PA as it may be normal early in the disease                        course.23,24
Electrocardiography (ECG) is indicated in patients with resistant hypertension to                    evaluate for left ventricular hypertension (LVH).3,12 LVH can both support the diagnosis of resistant hypertension, as                    end-organ damage is more commonly found in patients with true resistant                    hypertension, as well as identify patients at increased cardiovascular risk.                    Echocardiography is more sensitive in detecting LVH but is also more expensive.                    It may be considered in patients in whom a strong suspicion exists for LVH and                    may be particularly useful in men older than 50 years for whom the pretest                    probability is higher.34
Renal artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis is common in older patients.                    Screening for RAS can be done using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA),                    computer tomographic angiography (CTA), Doppler ultrasonography, or                    angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor renography.12,35 MRA or Doppler ultrasonography are preferred in patients with                    renal impairment.35
Treatment of resistant hypertension focuses on several components. These include                    maximizing therapeutic lifestyle changes, withdrawing any medications or                    substances which may contribute to elevated blood pressure, treatment of                    underlying conditions (such as obstructive sleep apnea) (see Table 3), maximizing medication                    adherence, and focusing on pharmacologic modalities likely to achieve target                    blood pressure.1
Nonpharmacologic treatment focuses on weight loss, dietary salt restriction                    (<100 mEq/24 hours), decreased alcohol ingestion, increased physical                    activity, and ingestion of a high-fiber, low-fat diet rich in fruits and                        vegetables.1,36 Weight loss has not been                    specifically studied in patients with RH but has been found to reduce both                    systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients.1,37 A low salt diet may be more likely to benefit                    patients who are at increased likelihood of salt-sensitivity, including older                    patients, African-American patients, and those with chronic kidney disease.37
The timing of medication administration can affect blood pressure control. In                    patients with uncontrolled hypertension on 3 or more antihypertensive                    medications all taken on awakening, switching one medication to bedtime                    administration resulted in significantly reduced 24-hour systolic and diastolic                    blood pressures, with 21.7% to 37% of those who changed one                    medication to bedtime dosing having their blood pressures subsequently                        controlled.38,39 Also shown was a reduction in                    the nocturnal nondipping pattern (<10% reduction in nocturnal                    versus daytime blood pressures), which may be of relevance given the evidence                    showing that nocturnal blood pressure readings are a better predictor of                    cardiovascular complications than 24-hour or daytime blood pressure                        readings.40–43
In a small study of 44 Brazilian patients, adding a pharmacist to the health care                    delivery team demonstrated improvement in blood pressure reduction, although                    half of the patients still had not reached their blood pressure goal, and showed                    improvement in one measure of social functioning.44 Pharmacist interventions included patient                    education, blood pressure measurement, and assessing adherence. Patient                    medication adherence increased from 63.3% to 95.5% at study                    end.
Pharmacologic treatment should concentrate on use of an appropriate diuretic with                    a thiazide diuretic for most patients and a loop diuretic for those with a                    decreased glomerular filtration rate.10 One recommended treatment foundation is a combination of a                    thiazide diuretic with a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB) and an ACE                    inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.10 Chlorthalidone may be preferred over                    hydrochlorothiazide, particularly in patients with resistant hypertension (see                        Table 4).24 Additional fourth-, fifth-,                    and sixth-line agents can be added based on individual patient characteristics                    with consideration given to treatment recommendations outlined by JNC VII.36 Other agents which should be                    considered include a mineralocorticoid antagonist, a combination alpha-beta                    blocker over a pure beta blocker, or direct vasodilating agents (hydralazine or                        minoxidil).10
Diuretic treatment is an important component of pharmacologic management of                    resistant hypertension since hypervolemia is common in patients with RH.19,24,45 Hypervolemia can result from excess sodium ingestion, progressive                    renal damage, fluid retention from blood pressure reduction, and underuse of                    diuretic treatment.18                    Diuretics are underused in the treatment of hypetension1,37,46 for a                    variety of reasons, including concern regarding metabolic side effects and                    misconceptions about maximum dosages.3,36 Addition of,                    increasing the dose of, or changing the class of diuretic is a recommended first                    step in the treatment approach to RH24 and may improve blood pressure in up to 50% of                        patients.19,46
Hydrochlorothiazide is used more commonly in clinical practice13 than chlorthalidone, a                    thiazide-like diuretic, probably because of increased ease of use with                    hydrochlorothiazide having more formulations available and being available in                    fixed-dose combination pills.37,45,46 While chlorthalidone and                    hydrochlorothiazide have not been compared for efficacy or tolerability in                    head-to-head trials, the greater clinical trial evidence is found for use of                    chlorthalidone for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and                        mortality.45                    Hydrochlorothiazide is commonly used in doses up to 25 mg daily, however doses                    up to 50 mg daily can provide improved control.36 Despite similar office blood pressure                    readings, chlorthalidone provides more effective 24-hour blood pressure control                    than hydrochlorothiazide.47                    This may be explained by their differences in duration of action: 16 to 24 hours                    for hydrochlorothiazide and 48 to 72 hours for chlorthalidone.48 Chlorthalidone is                    approximately twice as potent as hydrochlorothiazide; eg, 25 mg of                    hydrochlorothiazide is roughly equipotent to 12.5 mg of chlorthalidone.47,48 Hypokalemia has been raised as a concern with                    chlorthalidone. One cross-over study found no difference in the incidence of                    hypokalemia between equipotent dosages of hydrochlorothiazide and                        chlorthalidone,47 but                    overall the evidence is mixed about the incidence of hypokalemia between the two                        agents.13,46 Given its better 24-hour                    blood pressure control, chlorthalidone up to 25 mg daily is recommended                    preferentially in resistant hypertension.1,10,45,46,49 Caution should be used with thiazide                    diuretics in patients with a history of significant hyponatremia, hypokalemia or                        gout.36 Sodium and                    potassium levels should be monitored regardless of choice of diuretic.45
For patients with decreased renal function (creatinine clearance <30 to                    50 mL/min), thiazide diuretics are not as effective.1,3 Therefore, for these patients, loop diuretics are preferred. If                    short-acting loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide are used, they must                    be dosed at least twice daily for effective blood pressure control.3,38,50
Spironolactone, an aldosterone-antagonist, is an important tool in the                    pharmacologic management of resistant hypertension. As mentioned above,                    aldosterone excess is common in patients with resistant hypertension and also                    appears to be related to obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, two prevalent                    co-morbidities among patients with resistant hypertension. Therefore, it is                    logical that aldosterone blockade would play a role in the treatment of                    resistant hypertension. Studies demonstrate a benefit of spironolactone                    treatment in patients both with and without primary aldosteronism.28
The addition of low dose spironolactone (range of 12.5 to 50 mg daily) in the                    setting of refractory or resistant hypertension lowered systolic blood pressure                    by 21.7 to 28 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 8.5 to 13 mmHg. This was                    achieved regardless of presence of primary aldosteronism. In addition,                    pretreatment serum aldosterone levels, aldosterone excretion, and                    aldosterone/renin ratio did not predict blood pressure response to                        spironolactone.51–55 This                    has lead to increased recommendation for spironolactone in resistant                        hypertension,1,9,10,28,51–55 even                    as a fourth-line agent.13,44
Dosing is usually initiated at 25 mg daily, though 12.5 mg daily may be more                    appropriate in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and in                    the elderly. Spironolactone can be initiated simultaneously with a thiazide                    diuretic for the dual benefit of blood pressure control and potassium                        balance.13,28,56 Those on ACE inhibitors or ARBs are at                    increased risk of hyperkalemia. If patients are taking supplemental potassium,                    this should be discontinued (or reduced if taking significant quantities) on                    initiation of spironolactone. Potassium levels and renal function should be                    assessed in 4 weeks after initiation, except for the high risk groups mentioned                    previously, where assessment sooner may be warranted. Titration should be at 4-                    to 6-week intervals, with repeat assessment of potassium and renal function as                    above. Mild hyperkalemia can usually be managed with a reduction in dose, while                    with serum potassium levels > 5.5 mEq/L, spironolactone should be                    discontinued, possibly resuming at a lower dose once potassium levels have                    normalized. Dosages up to 50 mg daily have been studied in resistant                    hypertension; higher dosages may be warranted in those with confirmed primary                        aldosteronism.54,57,58
In addition to hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency, breast tenderness is a                    commonly cited adverse reaction to spironolactone. This effect is dose dependent                    and occurs in approximately 10% of men taking 25 mg daily.28,54 In these patients, therapy can be                    discontinued, then restarted at a lower dose once the tenderness has resolved.                    Other adverse reactions include gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities, and                    erectile dysfunction.54,58
Amiloride, an indirect aldosterone antagonist that is better tolerated due to its                    lack of antiandrogenic action, has not been studied in resistant hypertension as                    much as spironolactone has. One small study found that in patients with                    uncontrolled hypertension, the addition of 2.5 mg of amiloride daily decreased                    systolic blood pressure by 31 mmHg and diastolic by 15 mmHg.59 However, an audit of the use                    of 10 mg amiloride showed half the blood pressure reduction of spironolactone 25                    mg daily.60 Until more studies                    are completed, spironolactone should be used preferentially, unless the patient                    is unable to tolerate spironolactone. If amiloride is used, monitoring of                    potassium and renal function should be performed as mentioned above for                    spironolactone.
Eplerenone, a more selective aldosterone antagonist, is effective in the                    treatment of hypertension but has not been well studied in RH.10,13 It may be considered in patients intolerant                    of spironolactone, particularly those with sex-hormone related side effects                    (breast tenderness, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, and menstrual                        irregularities).24
ACE inhibitors also have a long history of use for hypertension and are                    particularly recommended in patients with diabetes mellitus, heart failure,                    post-myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, high coronary disease risk,                    and recurrent stroke prevention.36,61 ARBs are an                    alternative for patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. While studies looking at                    the combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in treating hypertension have shown                    improvement compared with monotherapy, most of these studies have not used                    maximum dosing of the monotherapy agent.1 In addition, combination ACE inhibitor/ARB                    therapy is not as effective as adding a diuretic or CCB to an ARB.62 Recent studies have indicated                    the possibility of increased adverse renal outcomes with dual ACE inhibitor and                    ARB treatment while not improving other clinical outcomes.63,64 Thus, dual ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy is not currently                    recommended for most patients.1,50,65 Dosage of an ACE inhibitor or                    ARB may be increased to the maximum recommended dosage as long as the serum                    creatinine does not increase more than 35% above baseline and                    hyperkalemia does not develop.36 Some patients will develop a mild (0.4 to 0.6 mmol/dL) increase                    in serum potassium levels that is self limiting.66
CCBs are further divided into dihydropyridine CCBs (amlodipine, felodipine,                    nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine) and nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem and                    verapamil). Both are recommended as possible initial drug therapy for                    hypertension by JNC VII.36                    Dihydropyridine CCBs bind with greater affinity to blood vessel receptors                    compared with non-dihydropyridine CCBs which have equal affinity for blood                    vessel and cardiac receptors.67 In doses used in clinical practice, nondihydropyridine CCBs can                    cause decreased cardiac conduction and myocardial contractility.67 CCBs have been recommended as                    a component of a three-medication regimen which includes a thiazide diuretic and                    either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, based partly on their complementary mechanism                    of action.1,50 Common side effects of CCBs                    include constipation and edema, the later usually not responsive to diuretic                        therapy.46
β-blockers have long been used for hypertension and are particularly                    recommended for patients with increased cardiovascular disease risk, heart                    failure, post-myocardial infarction, and diabetes mellitus.36 While masking of hypoglycemia has been a                    concern of using β-blockers in the setting of diabetes mellitus, a                    review found no evidence of β1-selective blockers masking                    hypoglycemia, prolonging hypoglycemia, or adversely affecting glucose                        metabolism.68                    β-blockers do have a disadvantage of reflexively causing increased                    peripheral edema. This has lead some experts to recommend α-blockers in                    conjunction with β-blockade, though not as first line therapy.1,3,13,49 This is in                    part due to the significant increase in cardiovascular events and                    hospitalization in doxazosin compared with chlorthalidone seen in the ALLHAT                    study that resulted in the early termination of the doxazosin arm.69 That said, α-blockers                    may be more a more logical choice in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms.                    Particular care should be taken to monitor for orthostatic hypotension with the                    use of α-blockers.
Thiazide diuretics can be safely and effectively combined with almost all classes                    of antihypertensive medications.24 A three-drug regimen containing a thiazide diuretic, a                    calcium-channel blocker, and an ACE inhibitor or ARB is advocated.24,28 While this triple therapy has not been widely                    studied, thiazide diuretics in combination with most classes of medications have                    proven more effective in blood pressure lowering than combinations not                    containing a diuretic.24
No specific combination regimen has been shown superior to others in the                    treatment of resistant hypertension. However, it is logical to use certain                    principles in guiding combination treatment. Patients should be treated with                    antihypertensive agents per compelling indications.36 Aside from these recommendations, patients                    can be assessed for the presumed underlying mechanism of hypertension                    (renin-based, aldosterone-based, hemodynamic/volume) in order to guide therapy                    recognizing that physician assessment of the underlying cause is both complex                    and difficult.14,70 What may be more practical is                    to assess the patient’s current regimen and treatment response, as most                    patients with resistant hypertension are already on a number of different                    agents. Patients with an incomplete response to a certain agent may benefit from                    an increased dose of that agent or addition of a second agent with a                    complimentary mechanism of action.13 While substitution of one agent for another is a potential                    strategy, add-on therapy is generally preferred,13 since complimentary mechanisms of action will                    improve overall efficacy of the regimen.
When adding on medications to combinations already containing a diuretic, CCB,                    ACE inhibitor or ARB, consideration should be given to combined                    α-β blockers over pure β-blockers3,71 and either centrally acting medications (clonidine, methyldopa)                    or direct vasodilators (minoxidil, hydralazine) although use of these latter two                    classes is limited by tolerability and frequent dosing.24 Combined α-β blockers, either                    through use of a single agent (carvedilol, labetalol) or two agents may offer                    benefits particularly in patients who have failed to achieve target blood                    pressure on a diuretic/ACE-inhibitor combination.71 As a result of the potent vasodilation                    produced by direct acting vasodilators, β-blockers and loop diuretics                    are usually necessary to overcome the reflex tachycardia and fluid retention,                    respectively. If patients are requiring these medications to control their blood                    pressure, hypertension specialists should likely be involved.1,13,49,72
Fixed-dose combination pills have been shown to increase adherence versus                    equivalent therapy with single-agent medications;73 however few studies have been performed                    comparing the efficacy of combination pills versus using combined monotherapy                    agents from each class included in the fixed-dose combination pill.74 Unfortunately, most fixed                    dose combination pills do not provide maximum dosages of included agents,74 though many monotherapy                    agents will require multiple pills to reach maximum dosages as well.
Endothelin receptor antagonists are a new family of antihy-pertensive medications                    that are currently being evaluated. Darusentan, a selective endothelin receptor                    antagonist currently under investigation and not yet available for clinical use,                    demonstrated sustained dose-dependent lowering of blood pressure in phase II                        studies.75 Darusentan is                    an antagonist selective for type A endothelin receptors, activation of which                    causes vasoconstriction and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle.75 Medication interactions,                    though not tested, are theorized to be low based on its elimination                        profile.76 Doses of up to                    300 mg daily of darusentan were associated with significant reductions in both                    systolic and diastolic blood pressures that persisted over 24 hours, as measured                    by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. However, there was no statistically                    significant difference between the groups in percent of patients achieving blood                    pressure goals (although there was a trend favoring darusentan).75 Headache and edema were the                    most common intervention related side effects.75 Potential adverse events of endothelin                    receptor antagonists (teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity) limit their use as                    first-line agents, but this study indicates a possible role for darusentan in                    the treatment of resistant hypertension. It should be noted that significant                    hepatotoxicity was not observed in this 10-week trial study.75
A double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of obese patients with                    uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment found that orlistat, compared with                    placebo, resulted in decreased diastolic blood pressures (–11.4 mmHg                    compared with −9.2 mmHg) and improved rates of achieving diastolic blood                    pressure goals (67% compared to 53%).77 The group treated with orlistat did achieve                    greater weight loss than the placebo group. The study was limited by high drop                    out rates in both the orlistat and placebo arm.
For patients who are truly resistant to antihypertensive medications and a                    thorough work-up for secondary causes has been completed, electrical carotid                    sinus baroreflex stimulation implantable devices have been shown in feasibility                    trials to reduce systolic blood pressure by 22 to 24 mmHg.78
Resistant hypertension should be differentiated from uncontrolled hypertension due to                medication nonadherence, under-treatment, or pseudoresistance. True resistant                hypertension can be diagnosed by taking a careful history, through confirmatory                blood pressure measurement with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and by                detecting clues on examination that indicate the presence of end-organ damage. When                resistant hypertension is diagnosed, it is important to consider secondary causes                such as primary aldosteronism or obstructive sleep apnea that may be causing or                contributing to elevated blood pressure readings. Treatment is focused on both                nonpharmacologic (weight loss, exercise, limiting sodium intake) and pharmacologic                modalities. Additionally, identification of and treatment of secondary causes is                essential. Pharmacologic treatment initially focuses on optimizing diuretic                treatment and is followed by selection of patient specific combination strategies.                Referral to a hypertension specialist is considered when pharmacologic treatment                fails to achieve blood pressure goals.
