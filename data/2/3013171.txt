SERUM LITHIUM LEVELS WITH SLOW-RELEASE AND CONVENTIONAL LITHIUM CARBONATE PREPARATION

Eighteen physically healthy volunteers were given 1200 mg of standard and sustained-release preparations of lithium on two different occasions. Serum lithium levels were estimated at four hourly intervals and statistically analysed. The findings and the results have been discussed with particular reference to their implications for future research.
