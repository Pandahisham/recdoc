The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of 	image-based diagnostic tools used in the investigation of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Summary of the experience gained by the author as well as relevant publications, regarding vein imaging modalities taken from a computerized database, was reviewed. The imaging modalities reviewed include phlebography, color Doppler duplex ultrasonography (CDDUS), computerized tomography angiography (CTA) and venography (CTV), magnetic resonance venography (MRV), and radionuclide venography (RNV). CDDUS is recommended as the modality of choice for the diagnosis of DVT. A strategy combining clinical score and D-dimer test refines the selection of patients. Phlebography is reserved for discrepant noninvasive studies.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb is a common and life-threatening condition. The incidence in the United States is estimated at 70–100 000 new cases/year with as many as 200 000 hospitalizations/year. It carries a risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome. Theincidence of PE is calculated at 600 000 cases/year, 100 000 of them are fatal [1–3]. Risk factors for lower extremity acute venous occlusion range from, prolonged immobilization tohypercoagulability syndromes, trauma, and malignancy. Venousthromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of morbidity andmortality during pregnancy and puerperium, and is second only tohemorrhage as the commonest cause of maternal death duringpregnancy [4]. There is a fivefold increased risk of VTE in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women of a similar age[5].
Malignancy and central venous lines are major risk factors ofupper extremity thrombosis (UEDVT) with predicted poor survival.The increasing use of indwelling central venous catheters (CVC)for transparietal feeding, fluid administration, and chemotherapyhas resulted in an increased prevalence of upper extremity venousthrombosis, although, the rate of catheter-associated thrombosisdecreased in recent years thanks to improvement inbiocompatibility and better insertion and maintenance techniques[6]. UEDVT may be asymptomatic or the clinical manifestations are not specific, presenting with arm or neck swellingor pain. In more than half of the cases objective methods ofexamination are negative for thrombosis. Pulmonary embolismsecondary to UEDVT, sometimes a lethal complication, is notunusual and has been reported in a comparable prevalence to lowerextremity thrombosis. Other significant complications of UEDVT areloss of vascular access, superior vena cava syndrome, andpostthrombotic venous insufficiency [7–9].
The clinical complications (from postthrombotic syndrome to fatalpulmonary embolism) as well the risk of anticoagulant treatmentrequire a precise diagnosis of DVT. The clinical diagnosis isunreliable: only 20–30% of symptomatic patients haveproven DVT and 90% of fatal PE are asymptomatic for DVT[10]. Objective methods of examination are demanded to reach an accurate diagnosis. Phlebography, computerized tomographyangiography followed by venography (CTA-CTV) and radionuclidevenography (RNV) are invasive or semi invasive tests. ColorDoppler duplex ultrasonography (CDDUS), and magnetic resonancevenography (MRV) are noninvasive methods. This paper highlightsthe potential risks and benefits of each of these techniques andpresents the advantages, disadvantages, and accuracy of thedifferent imaging modalities. An appropriate imaging algorithm forthe diagnosis of DVT is presented. The use of clinical pretestprobability scoring and diagnostic algorithms can help identifypatients requiring further investigation for suspected venousthromboembolism (VTE).
Phlebography (also called venography, ascending contrastphlebography, or contrast venography) is still considered the goldstandard in the diagnosis of peripheral DVT; it is the mostaccurate test with a nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity[11]. This X-ray examination provides an image of the limb veins after contrast material is injected into a distal vein(Figures 1(a)–1(c)) [12]. Mainphlebographic findings are persistent filling defect, abruptinterruption of contrast in a vein, lack of opacification in allor some deep veins, and flow diversion with opacification ofcollateral branches [13]. Venography relies on the anatomy of the venous system, lacking physiological information. It ispainful; expensive, exposes the patient to a fairly high dose ofradiation; and can cause complications related to nephrotoxicityand allergic reactions to iodinated contrast agents. It alsocarries a risk for post venographic phlebitis [14, 15]. In about 5% of cases, there are technical problems in conducting the test. Due to its invasive nature and the risk ofcomplications, it cannot be used neither as a routine test for thediagnosis of symptomatic DVT nor as a screening tool inasymptomatic patients at high risk for DVT. Peripheralphlebography is performed when the noninvasive examination colorDoppler US and duplex Doppler is doubtful or technically limited,such in suspected thrombosis of iliac vein, innominate vein, orsuperior vena cava [13].
CDDUS is the initial test of choice for diagnosis of acute DVT dueto its high accuracy, relatively low cost, portability, widespread,and lack of ionizing radiation [16]. B-mode ultrasound with Doppler color and duplex is the only noninvasive imaging testthat combines anatomy and physiology of the veins by visualizationof vein morphology and the map of flow velocity and direction. Itis required as the primary instrumentation for peripheral venoustesting according to the standards of the Intersocietal Commissionfor the Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories (ICAVL) [17]. CDDUS for the diagnosis of limb vein thrombosis uses a combinationof gray-scale, compression, color, and spectral Doppler sonography.Color and spectral Doppler analysis are useful in the diagnosticevaluation of DVT but are best considered as adjuncts to theconventional compression ultrasound examination. The examinationis performed by a high-resolution transducer of 7–10 MHz;a lower frequency-4–8 MHz is required for the obesepatient, the edematous limb, and the pelvic veins. The veinsscanned comprise the deep venous system—femoral vein at thegroin and along the thigh, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunkat the upper calf—and the confluence of the superficial greatsaphenous vein with the femoral vein. The deep calf veins areusually examined when localized pain or swelling ispresent. CDDUS findings of the normal vein aresonolucent lumen, easily compressible with a slight pressureexerted by the probe and centripetal nonpulsatile flow, withrespiratory phasicity and augmentation after Valsalva performance(Figures 2(a)–2(c)). An echogenic lumen, depending on thrombus age, uncompressible and flow devoid is diagnostic of a thrombotic vein (Figures3(a)–3(c)) [18–24]. The main aim of CDDUS is to confirm or exclude vein thrombosis.Further information includes thrombus extent andcharacterization—fresh or organized, free floating or attached,and partial or totally occlusive—that have prognostic value forthe development of pulmonary embolism and post-thromboticsyndrome. Patients with proximal DVT tend to present a slower and incomplete resolution of thrombus and to develop a more severepost-thrombotic syndrome due to deep venous reflux [25]. Free floating thrombus carries an increased risk of pulmonary embolism,although floating thrombus tends to attach to the vein wall orresolve, not warranting any specific therapeutic procedure[26]. Further diagnostic aims are to detect alternative disorders such as popliteal Baker's cyst, hematoma, aneurysm,pseudoaneurysm, lymphadenopathy, or other tumors, known as“pseudothrombophlebitis,” mimicking DVT. The incidence of thesealternative diagnoses is 11–18% [27]. A bilateral examination is indicated when high-risk patients are screened andin the workflow of suspected PE in patients with risk factors forDVT. Due to its high specificity, complete ultrasound examinationof the proximal and distal veins at least down to the level of thepopliteal trifurcation allows withholding anticoagulant therapywithout the risk of major complications. Isolated calf veinthrombosis does not carry a significant adverse outcome; scanningthe calf with localized symptoms or physical findings iscost-effective. A repeat examination is warranted if the clinicalfindings worsen; otherwise, a single examination is enough[28]. The sensitivity and specificity of USD for thediagnosis of DVT in symptomatic patients is very high.Compressibility under probe pressure (CUS) is the most accuratetest; for proximal DVT, femoral, and popliteal veins, compressionUS reached a sensitivity of 97 to 100% and a specificity of98 to 99%. For isolated calf DVT, the sensitivity droppedto 50–70% and the specificity to 60%. An echogeniclumen has a low sensitivity of about 50% for both proximaland calf DVT, due to the low echogenicity of the fresh thrombus[29–32]. In a meta-analysis of 100 cohort studiesthat compared Duplex US to contrast venography in patients withsuspected DVT; the sensitivity for proximal DVT was 96.5%,for distal calf DVT, 71.2% and specificity of 94.3%; thesensitivity improved in the recent years probably due to equipmentdevelopment, US technique used, and operator expertise [33].
Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality also for thediagnosis of upper-extremity thrombosis (UEDVT). The veinsexamined include the deep system—internal jugular, subclavian,axillary, and brachial veins. The superficial veins—cephalic andbasilica—are scanned in case of peripherally insertedcatheter-related suspected thrombosis. The fresh clot may be notvisualized and the diagnosis done on the presence of a veinenlarged and rigid, without changes on respiratory phases orrespiratory maneuvers. Useful findings to rule-out thrombosis arean echo-free compressible vein, normal response to respiratorymaneuvers-vein collapse on brief deep inspiration (sniff test), andenlargement on Valsalva test normal color Doppler and biphasicspectral display on duplex sonography [34–37]. The mainobstacle for the diagnosis of UEDVT is the presence of overlyingbones on the medial subclavian vein and centrally located veins,innominate and superior vena cava, that makes them difficult tovisualize and impossible to directly assess by compressiontechniques.
Spectral Doppler abnormalities in the subclavian vein may bepredictable for central occlusions. Flow void on color Doppler anda dampened nonpulsatile and nonphasic flow on duplex examinationare diagnostic for a central venous thrombosis [38]. A reversed flow in the jugular vein may indicate thrombosis in theinnominate vein with the internal jugular vein serving as acollateral pathway. Patel et al. [34]  related a 100% positive predictive value and 91% negative predictive valuefor sonography in the diagnosis of complete central occlusions.Small nonobstructive thrombus may remain undiagnosed and largecollateral veins misinterpreted as a normal vein, leading to falsenegative results. To overcome some of the limitations of USexamination of the upper limb veins, a small footprint sectortransducer from a supraclavicular or suprasternal approach may beof aid. CDDUS is a reliable method for diagnosing CVC-relatedthrombosis of the upper limb veins especially if severalparameters are evaluated in combination [39]. High diagnostic accuracy of UEDVT was found in 6 prospective studies, with asensitivity of 78–100% and a specificity of82–100% [8, 40–44]. False positive results were unusual. A sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of94% for compression US and color Doppler US for UEDVT usingvenography as the reference test ware reported by Prandoni et al. [44].
Chronic thrombosis in a patient with long-term catheterization ismore challenging, as enlargement of the thrombotic lumen is notpresent. Color Doppler is even more useful in chronic thrombosisdetecting collateral veins and an echogenic, flow void, and smallcaliber central vein. Large veins in an unusual anatomic positionand without the accompanying artery must be recognized as enlargedcollaterals and not be mistaken for the main vein. Aliasing due tohigh velocities and high pulsatility in the stenosed areas incomparison to dampened peripheral waveforms are additionaldiagnostic parameters. Frozen valve leaflets and echogenicsynerchias may be seen as sequels of previous thrombosis[35, 37, 45]. In any case, the diagnosis of catheter-associateddeep venous thrombosis may be difficult. Doppler ultrasound has alower accuracy in this setting than it does in lower extremityvenous thrombosis [46].
A particular different issue is acute on chronic thrombosis. Theenlarged vein with hypoechoic lumen represents an acute process.Recurrent thrombosis is a challenging diagnosis for all imagingmodalities. Comparison with a baseline examination may be helpfulin these cases.
The clinical diagnosis of DVT is unreliable, but clinicalprediction rules based on signs and symptoms do facilitate thecategorization of patients into high, low, or medium riskcategories [47]. A diagnostic strategy combining clinical score, D-dimer test, and compression US may refine the selection ofpatients. D-dimer assays have a high negative predictive value inpatients with suspected VTE and can exclude the diagnosis. Basedon clinical score and D-dimer test, venous US will be performed inpatients with a high clinical score, an elevated D-dimer, or both(Figure 4).
Screening patients with plasma D-dimer andultrasonography of the lower limbs may be the most cost-effectivestrategy. Ascending venography is reserved for patients withnegative or equivocal CDDUS results and a high clinicalprobability of DVT [28, 48–50]. In the current state of the art, CDDUS is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of DVT. Theappropriate examination is compression color duplex ultrasound ofthe complete venous system, including the distal veins when focalsymptoms or physical findings are present and a bilateralexamination in the high-risk patient. It is an accurate examination and allows an early and safe diagnosis of thrombosis without straining the patients. It is the main diagnostic tool insymptomatic patients and in screening asymptomatic DVT in specifichigh-risk populations. Pitfalls and limitations of venousultrasound are related to veins anatomy, flow changes, technicallimitations, and operator expertise.
Multidetector CTA, combined with venous-phase imaging (CTA-CTV),can accurately diagnose a pelvic vein or inferior vena cavaocclusion, sometimes the source of significant pulmonary emboli.Multidectector helical CT (MDCT) of the chest (100–140 mLof contrast medium injected at a rate of 3 mL/s) isfollowed by venous-phase imaging CT of the lower limbs without anyadditional contrast medium injection [51]. Indirect MDCT venography is acquired from the upper calves to the mid-abdomen.Thrombosis appears as a hypodense mass sometimes encircled by thehyperdense rim of contrast medium. The reported specificity andsensitivity compared with ultrasound is variable [52]. Coche et al. [51]  compared the results of CT venography for diagnosing DVT with those of Doppler sonography and phlebographyor repeated focalized sonography in case of discrepancy.Sensitivity and specificity of CTV were 93% and 97%,respectively (kappa = 0.88). CT venography in addition toCT pulmonary angiography is a relatively accurate method forevaluation of femoropopliteal venous thrombosis. In a comparativestudy between CTA-CTV and sonography, Garg et al. [53]  found a 100% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 100% negativepredictive value, and 71% positive predictive value for CTV.Satisfactory or good quality CT venography examination wasobtained in 97% of the studies. Two CT venography studies hadfalse-positive findings due to flow artifacts. The authorsconcluded that combined CT pulmonary angiography and CT venographymay be more efficacious than sonography or two separateexaminations in the selected patients. In another trial, CT venographyhad 93% accuracy compared with sonography in identifying deepvenous thrombosis. However, the positive predictive value of CTVwas only 67%, suggesting that sonography should be used toconfirm the presence of isolated DVT before anticoagulation isinitiated. CT venography interpretation should be performed withknowledge of certain pitfalls [54].
The prospective investigation of pulmonary embolism diagnosis IItrial was conducted to investigate the accuracy of MDCTA alone andcombined with venous-phase imaging (CTA-CTV) for the diagnosis ofacute pulmonary embolism [55].
MDCTA alone had 83% sensitivity, 96% specificity, andpositive predictive value with a concordantly high or lowprobability on clinical assessment. CTA-CTV for PE had 90%sensitivity and 95% specificity and was nondiagnostic with adiscordant clinical probability like MDCTA alone. Missingdiagnoses were due to poor image quality of either CTA or CTV.According to this trial, MDCTA-CTV has a higher diagnosticsensitivity than does CTA alone with similar specificity inpatients with suspected PE. The predictive value of both of themis high with a concordant clinical assessment, but additionaltesting is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistentwith the imaging results. According to Cham et al. [56], a substantial number of patients suspected to have PE had DVT in theabsence of PE. The combined technique of pulmonary CTA-indirectCTV has been shown to identify DVT in up to 18% of patientswith suspected PE who have no evidence of emboli on CTPA and thuscould have a significant effect on patient care. Indirect MDCTvenography is as accurate as sonography in the diagnosis offemoropopliteal DVT and can further reveal thrombus in largepelvis veins and the inferior vena cava, an important advantageover sonographic screening for DVT [57], although the technique is slightly more time consuming (up to 4 min delayafter contrast injection) and has an increased radiation dose[58].
Two-dimensional time-of-flight venography (TOF-MRV) is thetechnique of choice for magnetic resonance venography. Studies maybe performed without contrast and can depict emboli as fillingdefects or directly detect the thrombus. MR direct thrombusimaging (MR-DTI) is a novel technique which detectsmetahemoglobin, allowing direct visualization of pulmonary emboliand simultaneous imaging of the legs without the need forintravenous contrast. This technique uses a T1-weightedgradient-echo sequence, with a preexcitation radio-frequencypulse to abolish fat signal, and an inversion recovery time chosento nullify signal from flowing blood to maximize thrombusconspicuity. The technique is 98% sensitive and 96%specific for diagnosing DVT when compared with ultrasound andcontrast venography. Early data suggest that MR-DTI is also highlyaccurate in detection of PE and the safety of withholdingtreatment on the basis of MR-DTI alone is currently beingevaluated [59]. Acute occlusion of the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, often due to extension from thefemoropopliteal system, represents a major risk for PE. Color flowDoppler imaging is often limited for the diagnosis of iliocavalthrombosis owing to obesity and bowel gas. Both CT scans and MRimaging can accurately diagnose acute pelvic vein or inferior venacava occlusion and are as well helpful in diagnosing central chestvein occlusion. MRI is preferred because it is noninvasive, doesnot require contrast agent, carries no exposure to ionizingradiation, that is definitively demanded for pregnant women, andis highly accurate and reproducible [60].
Furthermore, MRV can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronicthrombus. In a study designed to evaluate the diagnostic value ofMRV and color Doppler US in the assessment of DVT compared withcontrast-enhanced venography, MRV was 100% sensitive and100% specific in the diagnosis of DVT above the knee. ColorDoppler imaging depicted 13 of 15 cases of DVT and 5 of 6venous examinations that had normal results, yielding sensitivityand specificity of 87% and 83%, respectively. Thedifferences in sensitivity and specificity between MRV and colorDoppler US were not statistically significant [61]. In a recent meta-analysis to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of MRVfor DVT, the pooled estimate of sensitivity was 91.5%(95% CI: 87.5–94.5%) and the pooled estimate ofspecificity was 94.8% (95% CI: 92.6–96.5%).Sensitivity for proximal DVT was higher than sensitivity fordistal DVT (93.9% versus 62.1%) [62]. MR venography seems to be more accurate than color Doppler sonography indetecting the extension of deep venous thrombosis. Shankar et al. [63]  performed two-dimensional gated inflow and phase contrast MRV in children with suspected upper extremityCVC-related thrombosis, to assess the extent of venous thrombosisand to locate patent veins for replacement central venouscatheter. MRV was more accurate than Doppler ultrasonography andcontrast studies for defining the extent of venous thrombosis. MRVcorrectly showed venous anatomy and patency for reinsertion ofCVC. MRV is considered medically indicated for evaluation ofvenous thrombosis or occlusion in the large systemic veins (e.g.,superior vena cava, subclavian, or other deep veins in the chest),for differentiation of tumor thrombus and blood clot and diagnosisof superior vena cava syndrome. The peer reviewed medicalliterature has not established MRV to be superior to duplexultrasonography for diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in the armsor legs. MRV has not been shown to be superior to US for lowerlimb DVT, except in imaging the deep femoral and hypogastricvessels. However, information about these vessels is not neededfor management decisions, except in patients with pulmonary emboliwhere the source of the emboli has not been identified byultrasonography [64]. MRV has the potential to be used as a stand-alone test for DVT but requires further evaluation.Therefore it is considered to be experimental and investigationalfor this application. Due to its high cost and limitedavailability, MRV should be reserved to diagnose DVT in patientsfor whom ultrasound examination is inappropriate or unfeasible[62]  and to replace venography and CTV in pregnant women and patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast mediainjection.
The radionuclide investigation of DVT includes such techniques asradionuclide venography and thrombus-avid scintigraphy. Althoughthese methods have not been as thoroughly evaluated as compressionultrasound, studies thus far have indicated encouraging results,and further investigations are warranted [65]. Radionuclide venography of the upper extremity has been described as a reliablenoninvasive procedure for early diagnosis of upper limb venousthrombosis associated with indwelling CVC. It is performed byinjecting both arms with approximately 5 mCi of technetiumpertechnetate followed by a normal saline flush. The dynamicimages are acquired on a large field of view camera with a high-energylow-resolution collimator at the rate of two frames persecond [66, 67]. (99 m)TC-MAA radionuclide imaging is auseful method for noninvasive detection of DVT and PTE. Combinedradionuclide venography and perfusion lung scan can also beperformed in the same setting if Tc99m-MAA is used[68]. The radionuclide venogram appears accurate in the proximal veins and in excluding but not diagnosing distal venousthrombosis. The potential advantages of radionuclide venographyversus contrast venography are low-volume and low-flow injection,no need to access a large peripheral vein, no adverse sideeffects, low radiation exposure (130 mrads), rapidity ofexecution, and no patient preparation. The disadvantage is the lowanatomic detail [66, 67].
In summary, invasive testing for venous thromboembolism can besafely avoided in the majority of patients, using diagnosticstrategies combining noninvasive tests.
Color and duplex ultrasound with manual compression (CDDUS) is themost sensitive and specific noninvasive test and is nowadaysaccepted as the modality of choice for the diagnosis of DVT. CTvenous-phase imaging at the time of CT pulmonary angiography andMR venography is comparable with venous ultrasonography in theevaluation of femoropopliteal DVT. The iliac veins and vena cava,vessels poorly shown on ultrasonography but sometimes the sourceof significant pulmonary emboli, are also depicted by CT and MRvenography. MRV can differentiate an acute occlusion from chronicthrombus. Due to its high cost and limited availability, MRV isnot used for the routine diagnosis of DVT and should be reservedfor the examination of inaccessible veins on ultrasonography andas a complementary test in nondiagnostic ultrasound studies forpregnant women and patients with contraindications to iodinatedcontrast media injection. Studies on venous scintigraphy haveindicated encouraging results but further investigations arewarranted. A diagnostic strategy combining clinical score, D-dimertest, and compression US can be used in a systematic way toreliably rule in or exclude venous thromboembolism.
Due to its high specificity, a negative examination may precludeanticoagulant treatment. A strategy  combiningclinical score and D-dimer test refines the selection of patients.Phlebography is the gold standard method but is invasive andcarries risks of contrast media complications and ionizingradiation. CTV following pulmonary CTA and MRV is useful to detectiliocaval thrombosis. MRV can differentiate acute from chronicthrombosis and diagnose central obstructions. RNV has low-anatomicdetail.
CDDUS is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of DVT. Adiagnostic strategy combining clinical score, D-dimer test, and CDDUS is recommended. Phlebography is reserved for discrepant noninvasive studies.
